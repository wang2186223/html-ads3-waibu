###Chapter 1: Reborn

Lucy White woke to blinding sunlight streaming through the windows.

She instinctively raised a hand to shield her eyes, wincing as her fingertips brushed against a dull ache on her forehead. When she opened her eyes, the unfamiliar luxury hotel suite jolted her fully awake.

"What…?"

Her gaze swept over the scattered empty liquor bottles littering the floor before landing on the lone cake on the dining table. The hardened wax around the numeral "1" candle resembled forgotten vows.

Memories flooded back.

A year ago today, she had booked this very suite, baked that cake, and prepared a feast—all to celebrate her one-year anniversary with Michael Johnson. But once again, the man had stood her up.

Staggering to the bathroom, Lucy stared at her reflection. The girl in the mirror had porcelain skin, tear tracks still fresh on her cheeks. Trembling, she touched her face—this wasn’t a dream. She had truly been reborn.

The shrill ring of her phone shattered the silence.

The name "Richard Brown" on the screen made her eyes turn cold.

"Lucy, have you seen the trending news?" Her agent’s voice dripped with feigned concern.

Lucy clenched the phone. She remembered this day too well—Lily Green’s staged arrest, Michael rushing to play the hero, while she waited like a fool until dawn.

"I have," she answered, her voice eerily calm.

Richard chuckled awkwardly. "Lily had a little mishap last night. Michael, as her senior co-star, went to help. That’s why he missed your date."

"And?" Lucy’s laugh was icy. "How many times has he ditched me for Lily now?"

The line went silent for a beat.

"We need your cooperation," Richard pivoted. "Paparazzi caught Michael leaving the police station with someone, but they didn’t get Lily’s face. We want you to claim it was you."

Her nails dug into her palm.

In her past life, she had fallen for this exact trap—taking the blame for Lily’s scandal, only to be cyberbullied into depression. Meanwhile, Lily rode the wave of Michael’s fame straight to the top.

"Why?" Her voice was glacial. "You want me to be Lily’s scapegoat?"

"Don’t be ridiculous!" Richard snapped. "Michael’s just protecting his career. As his girlfriend, it’s natural for you to clarify things."

Lucy suddenly laughed.

How ironic. Only in death had she realized she was nothing but a disposable side character in some cheesy romance novel—while Lily was this world’s chosen heroine.

"Tell Michael Johnson," she enunciated each word, "that from today onward, Lucy White wants nothing to do with him."

Hanging up, she opened the trending page.

The hashtag #TopTierCelebrityMichaelJohnsonSeenWithMysteryWoman exploded across the screen. The photo showed him shielding a heavily disguised woman with unmistakable tenderness. Anyone would assume they were intimate.

Lucy traced the screen, her eyes burning with resolve.

This time, she would tear apart this cliché novel’s script with her own hands.
###Chapter 2: This Time, I'm Dumping You

Lucy White traced her finger over the familiar-yet-strange handsome face on her phone screen, her lips curling into a self-deprecating smile.

In her past life, she had chased this man into the entertainment industry, only to end up broken and bruised. Now that she had a second chance, she wouldn’t make the same mistake again.

"Michael Johnson, this time, I'm dumping you," she murmured softly before locking her phone.

She was still living in Michael’s apartment. Back then, she had moved in without hesitation just to be closer to him. The irony? After two years of living together, they had barely even held hands.

The elevator doors slid open with a ding.

Lucy dialed her best friend Sophia Taylor’s number. "Sophia, help me find a place. Yes, I'm moving out today."

Sophia’s surprised voice came through the phone. "You and Michael—"

"We’re done," Lucy said calmly. "I’ll explain when we meet."

Hanging up, she pressed the accelerator. The black car cut a sharp arc through the streets, heading toward the high-end apartments in the east district.

Meanwhile, on a film set in the west district...

Michael rubbed his temples and instinctively reached for his phone. The lock screen was empty—no messages, no missed calls.

"Strange..." he muttered with a frown. Given Lucy’s usual behavior, she should’ve already bombarded him with a dozen texts by now.

His long fingers hovered over the call button, but before he could press it, a knock sounded at the door.

"Come in."

Richard Brown stepped inside, wearing a perfectly practiced smile. "Just woke up?"

"Yeah." Michael leaned back lazily on the sofa. "What’s up?"

"Take a look at this." Richard handed over his phone, the screen displaying the top trending hashtag: #MichaelJohnsonSeenWithLilyGreenAtNight#

Michael barely glanced at it. "Let PR handle it."

"I already contacted Lucy," Richard sighed. "I wanted her to post a clarification on social media, saying she was with you last night. But she... refused."

"What?" Michael finally looked up. "What did she say?"

Richard hesitated. "She said... she doesn’t want to clean up your mess anymore."

Michael’s expression darkened instantly. He grabbed his phone and dialed Lucy’s number.

Ring... Ring...

The call was abruptly disconnected.

He tried again. Same result.

By the fifth attempt, his knuckles had turned white.

"What the hell is she playing at?" he gritted out.

Richard seized the moment to stir the pot. "Maybe she’s jealous. After all, you were helping Lily last night—"

"There’s nothing between me and Lily!" Michael snapped, standing abruptly. "She’s blowing this out of proportion!"

Before he could finish, the apartment door clicked open.

Lucy walked in, her heels clicking sharply against the floor. "Who’s blowing what out of proportion?"

Both men turned.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, outlining her slender figure. Michael froze for a second—something about Lucy today felt different.

"Why didn’t you answer my calls?" he demanded, voice low.

Lucy tossed her bag onto the sofa. "I didn’t feel like it. Problem?"

Michael was momentarily speechless. He took a deep breath and cut to the chase. "About the trending topic—post a clarification now."

"No." Her refusal was absolute.

"Lucy!" His voice rose. "Enough with the tantrums! Lily and I are just colleagues!"

She smirked coldly. "Really? Then why do you always rush to her side whenever she needs help?"

"Stop being unreasonable," Michael growled, loosening his tie in frustration. "Last night was an exception!"

"So exceptional you couldn’t even send a text?" Lucy met his gaze head-on. "Michael, I’m not your accessory."

Richard quickly intervened. "Lucy, Michael knows he messed up. How about dinner tonight to make it up to you?"

"Not interested." She turned toward the bedroom. "I’m busy."

Michael grabbed her wrist. "What the hell do you want?"

Lucy yanked her hand free and enunciated each word:

"To. Break. Up."

The air turned to ice.

Michael stared at her, stunned. "What did you say?"

Lucy smiled coldly. "I said—we’re done."
###Chapter 3: Let's Break Up, We're Not Right for Each Other

"No." Lucy White felt a chill run through her as she took in Michael Johnson's impatient expression.

Again. Every time Lily Green was involved, he acted like this—as if she were the unreasonable one, while he and Lily were completely innocent.

Michael stood, looking down at her. "If you want this relationship to continue, behave yourself. Go to your room, think it over, and post that statement Richard told you to."

Lucy let out a cold laugh. "I did nothing wrong. I don’t need to reflect. And as for us..." She met his gaze squarely. "We're done."

Twenty years of growing up together—she had seen every side of him.

When she was bullied as a child, he was always the first to defend her. Even when his heart ached for her, he’d scowl and say, "You’re so clumsy. Next time, just hide behind me." Then, like magic, he’d pull her favorite candy from his pocket.

For him, she skipped grades, learned to cook, swallowed her temper, even entered the entertainment industry... And what did she get in return?

That phone call before she jumped to her death in her past life—Lily had answered it. In that moment, she realized how utterly foolish she had been.

"What did you say?" Michael’s expression darkened. "Lucy, don’t joke about breaking up!"

"I’m serious." Her voice was calm. "The person you are now... isn’t worth my love anymore."

Michael grabbed her wrist. "You don’t get to decide that alone! I don’t agree!"

Lucy pulled free with ease. "Your agreement isn’t required." She unclasped the necklace with the house key and set it on the coffee table. "Don’t contact me again."

As she turned toward her room, a loud crash echoed behind her—his phone smashing against the floor.

Richard Brown’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction as he feigned concern. "Michael, she’s just throwing a tantrum. Go talk to her—"

"No." Michael cut him off coldly. "Let her cool off."

The moment Richard left, he dialed Lily’s number. "They broke up."

"Really?" A light laugh came through the line. "She actually gave him up?"

"She was adamant this time." Richard smirked. "But even if she changes her mind, I’ll make sure she’s out for good."

Lily’s voice softened. "Then I’ll leave it to you, Richard. Oh, and that statement—"

"Don’t worry. If she won’t post it, someone else will."

Lucy packed quickly. Two suitcases held everything she owned.

At the door, Michael blocked her path. "This house was bought by my mother. You’re really leaving?"

"I’ll explain to Aunt Rachel myself." She didn’t look back as she pulled the door open.

"Lucy!" His voice was strained. "If you walk out now, don’t expect to come back!"

Her answer was the sharp click of the door shutting behind her.

Michael stood frozen, his chest hollow. But he stubbornly told himself this was just another one of her whims. Soon enough, she’d come crawling back to apologize.

Just like she always had before.
###Chapter 4: Talismans and Chance Encounters

Lucy White stepped out of her apartment in high heels and drove straight to the most renowned metaphysical shop in the antique district—Mystic Pavilion.

This century-old establishment had a dedicated talisman-making studio, and she rented the innermost room. Closing the door behind her, her fingertips brushed over the vermilion paper, the familiar texture transporting her back to her past life in the cultivation world.

"I need to hurry," she murmured.

Her experience in the arcane arts from her previous life had given her profound mastery over talismans. With a flick of her wrist, the vermilion ink flowed smoothly across the yellow paper, each stroke imbued with a unique energy.

Between strokes, she recalled her younger brother's pale face. That auction item was crucial, but her reality show fee wouldn’t be paid until after the broadcast—and even then, her agency would take a cut...

"Looks like I’ll have to rely on this," she muttered, eyeing the completed talisman on the table with quiet confidence.

By evening, she had finished five talismans. A sudden craving for the old-fashioned wontons from the west side of the city struck her, and despite the distance, she decided to drive there.

Night had fallen when she took a shortcut through a construction zone. The sparse streetlights cast long shadows as her tires crunched over loose gravel.

"BANG—"

A deafening crash ahead made her slam on the brakes. A massive truck was blocking the road, its cab empty but engine still running. In front of it, an SUV lay overturned.

Lucy quickly got out to investigate. The truck’s driver had fled the scene.

"Hit-and-run?"

She rushed toward the SUV. Through the shattered window, she glimpsed a figure slumped in the driver’s seat. After calling emergency services, she grabbed a crowbar from the truck’s toolbox.

"Hold on!"

The door was badly dented, but with a grunt of effort, she pried it open just enough. When she saw the injured man’s face, her breath caught.

"Ethan Smith?"

Those sharp, handsome features belonged to none other than the youngest Oscar-winning actor in the industry—the unattainable first love of the novel’s heroine, Lily Green.

In her past life’s memories, Ethan had vanished from the spotlight for two years after this accident. She remembered that during her darkest days, he had been one of the few who showed her kindness.

Her fingers found his pulse. His legs were the worst injured. Sensing his faint consciousness, she leaned closer and whispered, "Don’t worry. You’ll be okay."

From her bag, she pulled out a freshly drawn medicinal charm. She looped the red cord around his neck and pressed the talisman over his heart. A faint glow pulsed beneath it.

"Lucky you," she said with a soft chuckle.

Sirens wailed in the distance. After giving her statement to the police, she watched the ambulance speed away before melting back into the night.

Sophia Taylor’s apartment was brightly lit. The moment Lucy stepped inside, her best friend yanked her onto the couch.

"We have a problem!" Sophia shoved her phone at her. "Someone leaked that Michael Johnson picked you up from the police station last night!"

The hashtag #MichaelJohnsonPicksUpLucyWhite was already trending. The comments were a warzone:

[Useless pretty face at it again! Stay away from our king!]
[Rumor says she’s got a whole harem of sugar daddies. Maybe the wife found out?]
[Our Michael’s too kind—why bother with this gold-digger?]
[Fire her as his agent! Sick of this forced pairing!]

Lucy scrolled through the vitriol, a cold smirk curling her lips. The storm of public outrage had arrived even faster than she’d expected.
###Chapter 5: The Bigger the Fall, The Harder the Hit

Lucy White's Weibo comments section exploded overnight.

["Get out of the entertainment industry, you shameless hack! Stop dragging Michael Johnson into your mess!"]

["Rumor has it Lucy slept her way to the top. How dare she cling to Michael for clout?"]

["Drop dead, Lucy. People like you belong in hell."]

Vicious curses flooded the page, each laced with venom. Lucy’s fans tried to defend her, but their voices were quickly drowned out by the tidal wave of hate.

"Lucy, look at these comments..." Sophia Taylor’s fingers trembled with anger, her eyes reddening.

Lucy merely chuckled and tossed her phone onto the couch. "Let them rage. The louder, the better."

"But—" Sophia stomped her foot in frustration.

"Lily Green set a trap, and I didn’t take the bait. Of course she’d stoke the flames." Lucy leisurely painted her nails. "The bigger the scandal now, the sweeter the payback when the truth comes out."

Sophia froze. "You have a plan?"

"Obviously." Lucy blew on her freshly polished nails. "If Richard Brown contacts me in the next two days, tell him I’m too upset to see anyone."

"You’re switching agents?" Sophia’s eyes widened in realization.

Lucy winked. "Smart girl."

The next day, at Starlight Entertainment headquarters.

Lucy strode straight toward the CEO’s office but was intercepted by his secretary.

"Miss White, Mr. Wilson is occupied." The secretary’s disdainful glance made it clear she viewed Lucy as just another fame-hungry starlet.

Unfazed, Lucy handed her a slip of paper. "Tell him it’s about his sister’s life."

Skeptical but wary, the secretary took the note. Five minutes later, Lucy was ushered inside.

David Wilson sat behind his expansive desk, sharp eyes dissecting her. "How do you know about my sister?"

"Physiognomy." Lucy met his gaze without flinching. "Your scattered brow indicates a sibling in distress. And the Wilsons only have one heiress this generation."

David’s eyes narrowed. "Go on."

Lucy pulled a silk pouch from her bag. "This talisman can temporarily suppress her symptoms. If you doubt me, wait until midnight—she’ll suffer sudden heart palpitations. Place this under her pillow, and you’ll see."

David took the pouch, his fingers brushing against the cool fabric. "What do you want?"

"A new agent." Lucy smiled. "And a chance to clear my name."

David toyed with the pouch. "If this fails—"

"I’ll accept any consequence." Her voice was steel.

At exactly 11 PM, screams erupted from Emily Wilson’s bedroom. David burst in to find his sister gasping, her face ghostly pale as she clutched her chest.

Then he remembered.

He shoved the talisman beneath her pillow.

Three minutes later, her breathing steadied, and she drifted into peaceful sleep.

David stared at the slip of paper, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 6: The Talisman Actually Works

Lucy White placed the yellow talisman gently on the desk.

"I want to change my agent," she said bluntly.

David Wilson raised an eyebrow. "That's it?"

"For you, it's a small matter. For me, it's not easy." Lucy met his gaze steadily. "My agent is Richard Brown."

David knew Richard well—one of the most aggressive agents in the company, especially after he propelled Michael Johnson to stardom. Getting out of his roster wouldn’t be simple.

"Fine. If this talisman works, I’ll help you switch. If not, prepare to leave the industry." He picked up the talisman and examined it.

"Deal." Lucy turned to leave but suddenly paused.

She studied David’s face for a few seconds. "Mr. Wilson, there’s a dark aura between your brows. Your sister might be in danger."

David’s expression darkened instantly. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

He hated when people brought up his sister.

"Believe it or not." Lucy pointed at the talisman on the desk. "This can help her. You’ll get a call from your family soon."

With that, she walked out, leaving David scowling.

When his secretary, Robert Lee, entered with tea, he found David staring blankly at the trash bin.

"Mr. Wilson?"

Snapping out of it, David briefly recounted what had happened.

Robert scoffed. "A girl in her early twenties thinks she can read faces? Ridiculous."

David thought the same. He tossed the talisman into the bin and was about to speak when his phone rang.

"What? Emily fell down the stairs?" David shot to his feet. "I’m on my way!"

Hanging up, he and Robert exchanged stunned looks.

"That… that’s too much of a coincidence," Robert stammered.

David bent down, retrieved the talisman from the trash, and carefully slipped it into his pocket.

"I’m heading to the hospital. Look into Lucy White and Richard Brown."

At the hospital, the operating room light was still on.

Mrs. Wilson wiped her red-rimmed eyes. "The doctor said it’s just a fracture, but Emily’s always been frail…"

Silently, David tucked the talisman into his sister’s hospital gown pocket.

"What are you doing?" Mr. Wilson frowned.

After hearing his son’s explanation, Mr. Wilson looked skeptical. "You really believe in this?"

"It can’t hurt to try," Mrs. Wilson said, dabbing her tears.

The surgery went smoothly. When Emily woke up, she was surprised by how well she felt.

"Strange… I don’t feel cold after the surgery this time."

Mrs. Wilson brightened. "Could it be the talisman?"

After the explanation, Emily hesitantly pulled out the talisman. Soon, the familiar chill crept back.

"It really works!" She quickly put it back, and the symptoms eased immediately.

David called Lucy without delay.

While waiting for her, David went upstairs to visit his friend Ethan Smith.

When he opened the door, he saw Ethan hastily shoving something into his clothes.

"What are you hiding?" David asked curiously.

Ethan kept his expression neutral. "Nothing. Just checking my phone."

David didn’t press further and sat by the bed. "Listen, something strange happened—"

Meanwhile, Lucy stood at the hospital entrance, gazing up at the white building.

"As I thought… the negative energy here is worse than I imagined."
###Chapter 7: So It Was You

David Wilson pushed open the door to find Ethan Smith reclining on the hospital bed, reviewing documents.

"Shouldn't you be in a meeting right now?" Ethan closed the folder, arching a brow.

David pulled up a chair. "Emily fell down the stairs. She's in a room downstairs." He studied his friend's expression. "How are you feeling?" Last night, when he'd received the news of the accident, his phone had slipped from his grasp in shock.

Even the doctors called it a medical miracle—such a severe crash, yet only minor injuries.

Ethan touched the red cord around his neck. "Much better. Is Emily alright?"

He knew better than anyone that his rapid recovery was entirely due to that mysterious talisman from last night.

"Fractured. She'll need time to heal." David couldn't help unloading the day's events. "You should've seen it—when that talisman burned..." He rubbed his arms. "I never believed in this stuff before."

Ethan's gaze flickered. "The person who gave it to you—she's a Starlight Entertainment artist?"

"Yeah, Lucy White." David pulled out his phone and scrolled. "She had a breakout role in an idol drama last year, then faded into obscurity."

Ethan had already opened Twitter. The hashtag #LucyWhiteLeaveTheIndustry glared at him from the trending list.

"She's being targeted?" Ethan frowned.

David shrugged. "She said she can handle it."

Ethan tapped the screen lightly. "Any upcoming schedules for her?"

"She's filming Strawberry TV's new variety show next week." David's eyes widened. "Wait—don't tell me you're..."

"Arrange it for me." Ethan set his phone down. "I'm joining."

David nearly leapt from his chair. "You? On a variety show?"

This was the same man who couldn't be bothered to walk red carpets at international film festivals.

"Mhm." A faint smile curved Ethan's lips. "Consider it returning a favor."

David suddenly understood. "You're doing this for—"

"Is Ian Stone free lately?" Ethan cut him off.

"You want Ian to mentor her?" David sucked in a breath. "He's our company's ace agent!"

Ethan traced the edge of his watch. "He owes me."

David shook his head, chuckling. "Classic you."

After chatting a while longer, David checked the time and stood to leave.

Meanwhile, Lucy was being enthusiastically clasped by Mrs. Wilson's hands.

From the hospital bed, Emily beamed. "You're even prettier in person than on TV!"

She'd never seen someone so beautiful—like a noblewoman stepped out of an ancient painting, every smile carrying an indescribable grace.
###Chapter 8: The Truth Revealed

Lucy White took an immediate liking to Emily Wilson, the gentle and kind-hearted girl. The two of them chatted effortlessly, finding common ground.

"Miss White," David Wilson suddenly spoke up, his voice laced with urgency. "You said you could cure my sister. What do you need from us?"

Mrs. Wilson quickly chimed in, "Yes, yes! How can we help?"

Lucy smiled faintly, but her gaze lingered on Emily’s slender wrist. "This bracelet—someone gave it to you, didn’t they?"

Emily’s eyes widened in surprise. "How did you know?" She instinctively touched the bracelet. "Does it... have something to do with this?"

"Exactly." Lucy’s expression turned grave. "All the accidents, bad luck, weakness, and insomnia you’ve suffered over the years—it’s because of this."

"Judging by your condition, you’ve been wearing it for three years." Lucy paused. "If you keep it on any longer, I’m afraid..."

Her words sent a chill through the Wilson family.

Emily was too stunned to speak. She never imagined that the source of her years of suffering was this very bracelet.

"It really did start three years ago..." Emily murmured, her fingers trembling uncontrollably.

Mrs. Wilson yanked the bracelet off. "Who gave this to you?"

Emily bit her lip and glanced at her father. "It was... my cousin. She said it had been blessed..."

"Impossible." Lucy’s tone was firm. "This is a burial artifact, steeped in dark energy."

Emily paled. "Why would she do this to me?"

"For love." Lucy didn’t mince words. "She wants your fiancé."

Emily felt as if she’d been struck by lightning. She remembered how her cousin always made a point of getting close to her fiancé whenever she visited...

"So she was trying to..." Emily’s voice shook.

David sneered. "If something happened to you, the engagement would naturally fall to her."

Mrs. Wilson trembled with rage. "How cruel!"

"However," Lucy added, shifting the conversation, "your fiancé hasn’t betrayed you—at least not yet."

Emily let out a small sigh of relief.

"But," Lucy continued, "your cousin has definitely been scheming behind the scenes."

A cold glint flashed in David’s eyes. "I’ll look into it."

"No." Mr. Wilson suddenly spoke, his voice icy. "I’ll handle it."

Lucy tactfully redirected the focus. "The priority now is dealing with the bracelet. You’ll need to find a piece of jewelry infused with protective energy..."

David caught on immediately. "Do you have any recommendations?"

Lucy shook her head. "You’ll need to consult a professional metaphysician."

As she was leaving, David escorted her to the door. "The issue with the agent—it’ll be resolved today."

Lucy nodded in thanks, a faint smile playing on her lips as she turned away—the real drama was only just beginning.
###Chapter 9: He Panicked

Ding-a-ling—

Lucy White had just finished her yoga session when her phone rang abruptly.

The caller ID showed David Wilson.

"Hello, Mr. Wilson," she said, wiping the light sweat from her forehead.

"Lucy, can you come to the office now?" David's voice was gentle yet firm.

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "Of course. I'll be there in half an hour."

After hanging up, she quickly showered and changed into a simple yet elegant white dress.

Starlight Entertainment Headquarters.

The elevator took her straight to the top-floor executive office.

When she pushed the door open, Lucy paused slightly.

David sat across from a refined middle-aged man, who was leisurely sipping tea.

"You're here?" David smiled and gestured. "Have a seat."

Lucy sat down gracefully, her gaze subtly assessing the unfamiliar man.

"Let me introduce you," David said, nodding toward the man beside him. "Nathan King. He'll be your new agent from now on."

Lucy's heart skipped a beat.

Nathan King? Starlight's top-tier agent?

In her past life, this legend had been notorious for his sharp eye—anyone he managed skyrocketed to fame. After the actor he last represented retired, he hadn't taken on any new talents.

"Nice to meet you, Mr. King," she said, suppressing her surprise as she extended her hand politely.

Nathan looked up, his piercing eyes studying her. "Hello."

He set down his teacup, his tone neutral. "Ethan Smith's recommendation. I hope you won't disappoint."

Lucy's pupils contracted slightly.

Ethan Smith? The award-winning actor Ethan Smith?

Since when had she gotten involved with someone like him?

"Don't worry, Mr. King," she replied smoothly, adjusting her expression. "I won't let you down."

A flicker of approval crossed Nathan's eyes.

Smart. Quick on the uptake.

"How do you plan to handle the trending scandal?" he cut straight to the point.

Lucy was prepared. She pulled out her phone, typed out a draft, and handed it to him. "What do you think?"

Nathan skimmed it, then smirked. "Interesting."

The post was concise and bold:
[@LucyWhiteV: Not taking the blame for this. Legal notices have been sent—rumormongers, tread carefully. PS: My figure’s way better than this. [Photo][Photo]]

The attached images were a stark contrast: one was the blurry backshot from the scandal, the other was her recent gym photo.

"Not afraid of backlash?" Nathan asked, intrigued.

Lucy chuckled. "I'll get hate either way. Might as well make it satisfying."

"Good." Nathan suddenly stood and extended his hand. "Pleasure working with you."

Lucy beamed. "Pleasure's mine!"

She immediately changed her account password and hit Post.

On-Set Lounge.

Michael Johnson had just removed his makeup when his assistant rushed in. "Michael, we have a problem!"

"What now?" he snapped impatiently.

The assistant handed him a phone. "Ms. White just posted..."

Michael's expression darkened as he read.

The photo clearly showed him and Lily Green from the paparazzi shot, while Lucy's caption was a direct slap in the face.

He immediately dialed Lucy's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

Three tries. Same automated response.

Michael clenched his phone, knuckles whitening.

"Use your phone," he ordered his assistant.

The assistant complied, then hesitantly passed it over. "It's ringing..."

"Lucy!" Michael snatched the phone. "What the hell is this?"

A beat of silence. Then Lucy's cool voice replied, "Who is this?"

Michael froze. "Stop playing dumb!"

"Oh, Michael," she said distantly. "What do you want?"

"Delete that post. Now."

Lucy laughed lightly. "Why should I?"

"You—"

"Actually," she cut in, "I should inform you. I have a new agent now. For work matters, contact Nathan King directly."

"What? Nathan King?" Michael's voice rose in disbelief. "Are you insane? Do you even know who he is?"

"Of course I do," Lucy said breezily. "That's why I'm thrilled."

"Lucy!" Michael's chest heaved. "What are you trying to pull?"

The sound of rustling papers came through—she was clearly preoccupied.

"If that's all, I'm hanging up," she said dismissively. "Oh, and don’t bother calling from different numbers. I’ll block every single one."

"You wouldn’t dare!" Michael roared.

Beep—beep—

Only the dial tone answered him.

Michael stood motionless, his phone slipping from his grip.

For the first time, it hit him—Lucy was serious.

She really… didn’t want him anymore.
###Chapter 10: Bring It On

Richard Brown stared at his phone screen, a cold smirk playing on his lips. The call had actually gone through—apparently, Lucy White still didn’t dare to completely cross him.

"What do you want?" Lucy's cool voice came through the line.

"Lucy, have you lost your mind?" Richard suppressed his anger. "Do you have any idea how much trouble that tweet will cause for Michael? Delete it. Now."

"Delete it?" Lucy let out a soft laugh. "And let everyone accuse me of riding on someone else's popularity? Nice try, Agent Brown. Your schemes are as transparent as ever."

Richard’s expression darkened. "You’d better think carefully about the consequences of crossing me. Starting today, all your schedules are suspended."

"Oh?" Lucy’s voice turned icy. "Richard Brown, you’re fired. Effective immediately, I’m no longer your client."

"You’re dreaming!" Richard shot to his feet. "The company won’t assign you a new agent without my approval!"

"Go to hell." The call ended with a sharp click.

Richard’s grip on his phone tightened, his knuckles turning white. He couldn’t believe Lucy had the audacity to speak to him like that.

"What did she say?" Michael Johnson frowned from across the room.

"Not only did she refuse to delete the tweet," Richard spat through gritted teeth, "she actually threatened to replace me as her agent!"

Michael’s frown deepened. "She’s gone too far this time."

Before Richard could respond, his phone rang again. Seeing the caller ID—HR—a sense of foreboding twisted in his gut.

"What? Reassigned to Nathan King?" Richard’s face turned ashen as he hung up. "How the hell does she have connections with the company’s top brass?"

Michael was equally stunned. Nathan King was the agency’s top agent. Since when had Lucy gotten close to him?

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office at Starlight Entertainment...

"Nathan, I want to post this." Lucy handed her phone to her new agent.

Nathan skimmed the draft and raised an eyebrow. "You sure you want to go this hard?"

"Absolutely." Lucy’s gaze was unwavering. "It’s time everyone knew I’m not just some pretty face they can push around."

Nathan’s lips curved in approval. "Fine. Post it tomorrow. PR will back you up."

Stepping out of the office, Lucy took a deep breath. This time, she’d make sure the whole world saw exactly who Lucy White really was.
###Chapter 11: Lucy Stands Her Ground

Sunlight streamed through the curtains as Lucy White lounged on the sofa, her slender fingers tapping lightly on her phone screen.

@LucyWhite: New agent acquired. No publicity stunts, no riding on coattails, no chasing clout. Certain fans, kindly back off.

The post instantly blew up, shooting to the top of the trending list.

The vicious curses from her past life still echoed in her ears. Michael Johnson’s fans had harassed her relentlessly for three years—some even ambushed her with acid outside her home. If she hadn’t reacted fast, her face would have been ruined.

This time, she wouldn’t take it lying down.

Within three minutes, the comments exploded.

[OMG, queen energy! Slay!]
[About time! Those toxic fans act like they own the industry.]
[Our Lucy deserves better. Solo queen vibes!]

Michael’s stans, infuriated, launched their counterattack.

[Who are you kidding? You only got famous by clinging to our idol.]
[LOL, a nobody like you has the audacity?]
[Bet Richard Brown dumped you. Stop pretending.]

Lucy smirked, sipping her coffee. Her phone buzzed—a message from Nathan King:

"Ready?"

She replied: "Always."

Five minutes later, Nathan, one of the industry’s top agents, posted:

@NathanKing: Thrilled to partner with @LucyWhite. Expect fireworks.

Then, Starlight Entertainment’s official account dropped a bombshell:

"After investigation, Richard Brown has been terminated for gross professional misconduct during his tenure as Lucy White’s agent. Nathan King will now oversee her career."

The entertainment world reeled.

Richard, mid-meeting, stared at his flooded inbox. He slammed his cup down, face twisted in rage. "This can’t be happening!"

Meanwhile, Lucy scrolled through the comments, amused. The taunts about "Richard dumping her" now looked pathetic.

[HOLY—NATHAN KING?!]
[The legend who molded three Oscar winners and two music icons?!]
[The clapback came faster than a tornado!]

Michael’s fans fell silent. Lucy’s supporters, however, erupted in celebration.

[How’s that slap feel, haters?]
[Who said our girl couldn’t get an agent again?]
[NATHAN. FREAKING. KING. Eat your hearts out.]

Lucy set her phone aside and stretched by the window. Sunlight kissed her sharp profile as a confident smile curved her lips.

This was just the beginning.
###Chapter 12 She Really Left Him This Time

Lucy's fingers danced across her phone screen as she swiftly responded on Weibo. First, she tagged Nathan King with the caption "Looking forward to working together," then tagged Stellar Entertainment's official account with a simple "Thank you."

The post detonated like a bomb, instantly setting the fandom ablaze.

Her fans, the LEMONs, erupted in celebration.

[OMG our girl is moving up in the world! Nathan King is the legendary agent who groomed three Best Actors!]

[Who said Lucy got dumped? She was the one who ditched that useless agent!]

[LOL at the haters scrambling now. How’s that humble pie taste?]

[Richard Brown was trash. Nathan is the real deal!]

The antis and rival stammers fell silent. Even the most vocal trolls suddenly had nothing to say.

The entertainment industry was stunned.

"Lucy White actually got Nathan King on board?"

"Stellar Entertainment is publicly backing her? Who’s pulling strings behind the scenes?"

Several variety show producers quietly scrapped their plans to exploit the drama. They needed to reassess Lucy’s worth.

Meanwhile, Lucy was touring an apartment with Sophia.

"This duplex has top-tier security. No paparazzi will get past it." Sophia pushed open the floor-to-ceiling windows. "Great natural lighting too."

Lucy surveyed the 200-square-meter space, its minimalist decor exuding understated elegance. She nodded. "This one."

After signing the lease, Lucy turned to Sophia. "I’m driving back tonight to pick up my mom and brother. Can you stock the place with essentials?"

"Leave it to me." Sophia winked. "Nathan and I will handle the online mess."

As night fell, Michael Johnson stood outside Sophia’s building, his expression stormy.

"Where’s Lucy?" He blocked Sophia at the door.

She rolled her eyes. "None of your business."

"We just had a fight." His voice tightened. "Tell her I know I was wrong."

Sophia scoffed. "Too late for that."

The door slammed in his face.

In the car, his assistant ventured cautiously, "Next week’s variety show… you’ll see her there."

Michael’s eyes lit up.

She couldn’t avoid him forever, not when work was involved.

He pulled out his phone, the trending topic #LucyWhiteNathanKing twisting like a knife in his chest.

She’d forgive him this time… right?

His fingers hovered over their chat window, typing and deleting until only one message remained:

"We need to talk."

A red exclamation mark glared back at him.

She’d blocked him.
###Chapter 13: The Warmth of Reunion

The living room light was still on when Lucy White pushed open the front door.

"Mom!" Her voice trembled slightly, eyes glistening with emotion.

Grace White rose from the couch and hurried toward her. Dressed in simple loungewear, her gentle gaze softened further. "What brings you home so suddenly?"

Lucy buried herself in her mother's embrace, inhaling the familiar scent of jasmine. "I missed you," she murmured.

Grace stroked her daughter's long hair, noticing the faint exhaustion on her face. "I saw what happened online."

"I broke up with Michael Johnson," Lucy said firmly, lifting her head. "I want you and Noah to come live with me."

Grace paused briefly before smiling warmly. "Alright."

That single word made Lucy's nose sting. She knew her mother had likely pieced things together but chose not to pry.

"The place I rented has a garden. We can move all your plants there," Lucy said, guiding her mother to sit. "And Noah's condition... I want to try helping him."

At the mention of her son, a shadow crossed Grace's eyes. Sixteen-year-old Noah White had spent most of his life bedridden due to his rare constitution.

"Is Noah asleep?" Lucy asked softly.

"He had another episode this afternoon but just took his medicine," Grace sighed. "I didn't tell him you were coming."

Lucy tiptoed into her brother's room. Under the dim glow of a bedside lamp, the boy's pale face looked fragile. She fastened a newly drawn calming talisman around his neck, brushing her fingers over his furrowed brow.

The next morning, the kitchen was filled with savory aromas.

"Sis!" Noah's delighted voice rang out behind her. He held up the talisman, eyes bright. "You came back last night? I feel so much better!"

Lucy turned and pinched his cheek. "Go wash up. The eggs are almost ready."

At the breakfast table, Grace watched her children bicker with relaxed fondness. When Lucy brought up moving again, she simply nodded. "Whatever you think is best."

Three days later, Sophia Taylor helped them settle into the new home. The balcony overflowed with Grace's carefully nurtured flowers, and Noah's complexion visibly improved.

"Sis, this place is great," the boy said, leaning against the floor-to-ceiling window as city lights twinkled beyond.

Lucy ruffled his hair. "It'll only get better."

Soon, the day arrived for the reality show recording. Titled Rural Getaway, the program blended talent competition with unscripted moments, broadcast entirely live.

At seven in the morning, Lucy boarded the production van. After a three-hour drive, she reached the remote village filming location.

"Welcome, Ms. White!" A crew member handed her a microphone. "We're already live."

In the courtyard, three male guests chatted casually. They stood to greet her as she entered.

"Mr. Lee, Mr. Jones, Mr. Miller," Lucy acknowledged with a polite nod.

The live comments exploded instantly:
[Lucy looks stunning today!]
[That casual outfit suits her perfectly]
[Can't wait to see her shine!]

Unbeknownst to her, Michael Johnson was watching from another livestream, his expression dark. He hadn't expected to see her again this way.
###Chapter 14: The Mysterious Guest Arrives

Lucy White settled into the bamboo chair, her fingers lightly tapping the table as she made small talk with the other three guests.

The wooden door creaked open. Everyone looked up to see Olivia Davis gliding in on stiletto heels. The rising star, famous for her role in the period drama Phoenix Perch, wore a champagne-colored dress that made her skin glow like snow.

"Hello, everyone," Olivia said with a sweet smile, her gaze lingering on Lucy for a beat too long.

Just as the atmosphere warmed, another movement came from the entrance. Michael Johnson strode in with one hand in his pocket, his black leather jacket amplifying his rebellious aura. His eyes immediately locked onto Lucy, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

Close behind him, Lily Green followed, carefully lifting the hem of her mint-green gown. A pearl hairpin adorned her hair, completing her innocent, flower-like image.

"Miss White," Lily suddenly spoke, her voice dripping with sweetness, "why don’t we switch seats? You and Mr. Johnson seem… familiar."

The room fell silent. The cameras instantly caught the tension in Michael’s clenched jaw.

Lucy chuckled, twirling a strand of her hair. "Better not. Last time I shared a frame with him, his fans accused me of riding his fame." She tilted her head, feigning distress. "I’d rather not trend for the wrong reasons again."

Daniel Miller nearly choked on his water.

Michael’s expression darkened, his knuckles turning white. Lily froze, clearly unprepared for Lucy’s bluntness.

The live comments exploded:
[She has no shame!]
[Our idol doesn’t even want her near him!]
[Is she playing hard to get now?]

Lucy’s fans fired back:
[The hypocrisy is unreal.]
[What’s wrong with keeping her distance?]
[Just enjoy the show, haters!]

"Ahem," Robert Lee quickly intervened, "I heard the last guest is a surprise?"

As if on cue, the door swung open again. A tall figure stood silhouetted against the light, drawing sharp gasps from the room.

The comments section froze—then erupted:
[HOLY—ETHAN SMITH?!]
[The producers went all out!]
[This lineup is insane!!!]

Lucy’s pupils contracted. Ethan Smith? What’s he doing here?
###Chapter 15: Keeping Distance

Ethan Smith, the youngest Best Actor winner in the entertainment industry, was a versatile superstar excelling in both singing and dancing.

Though this variety show was decent, someone of Ethan's caliber shouldn't have been here at all.

What was even more surprising was why this reclusive actor, who never participated in reality shows, had suddenly joined.

Robert Lee, who had worked with Ethan on a film before, was somewhat familiar with him. He stepped forward with a smile. "I never expected the mystery guest to be you, Ethan."

The others nodded in agreement—this was an absolute dream come true.

Ethan wasn’t just an acclaimed actor; he was the pinnacle of A-list celebrities. With him on board, the ratings were guaranteed to skyrocket.

Ethan gave a faint smile. "I’ve had no work lately, so I thought I’d relax here."

Everyone knew he’d been in a car accident the previous week, so the excuse made perfect sense.

The other guests quickly stood to greet him, introducing themselves one by one.

Lucy White was slightly taken aback. In her past life, the original guest hadn’t dropped out—why had he been replaced?

Still, she had a good impression of Ethan. He was definitely better than the difficult guest they were supposed to have.

She rose as well and gave a brief introduction.

When Lily Green saw Ethan, her eyes instantly lit up. Even before her transmigration, he had been her idol and ultimate crush.

The man who had once been unreachable was now standing right in front of her. She had to seize this opportunity!

She was the last to speak, her voice dripping with sweetness. "Ethan, I’m your biggest fan! I’ve watched all your movies—I adore them!"

It was the truth. She used to fantasize about being in a relationship with him.

Now that she was stunningly beautiful and effortlessly charming, maybe she could actually win him over.

Not only would it fulfill her dream, but she could also leverage his connections to skyrocket to fame.

She played the role of an adoring fan so well that no one suspected a thing.

Ethan remained distant. "Thank you."

He had a sharp eye for people. Beneath Lily’s enthusiastic facade, he could see the calculation in her gaze. Someone like her—he’d keep his distance.

The live comments exploded:
[OMG, it’s Ethan!!]
[This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment!]
[His visuals are insane!]
[The production team is legendary!]

The director grinned ear to ear as the viewer count surged. He had no idea why Ethan had volunteered to join, but this was an absolute windfall!

[Is Lily really a fan?]
[Feels a bit forced.]
[She’s the least famous here—this act is weird.]
[First she made Lucy switch seats, now this? Total green tea vibes.]

Lily’s fans immediately fired back:
[Lily is an angel!]
[She’s the sweetest and most genuine!]

But everyone’s attention was on Ethan, and the argument was quickly ignored.

Once all eight guests had arrived, the director announced the rules:
"This episode’s theme is rural living—you’ll be self-sufficient."
"We’ll provide ingredients for lunch, but you have to cook it yourselves."
"In the afternoon, you’ll work in the village to earn money for dinner."
"Whether you eat well or go hungry depends entirely on you."

Daniel Miller groaned, "I knew there’d be a catch!"
Robert chuckled. "Of course we’d have to work."

The director grinned. "That’s what makes it fun!" Then he and the crew promptly left.

As the eldest, Robert took charge. "Who can cook? I can make a few basic dishes, but nothing special."

The show prided itself on authenticity, so the theme had been kept secret. Everyone had expected something talent-related—no one was prepared for a farm experience.

Now, they’d have to improvise.
###Chapter 16: Kitchen Showdown

"I only know how to eat," Daniel Miller scratched his head, looking innocent. "But I can wash vegetables."

Several male guests chimed in: "Same here."

Lily Green's eyes lit up as she raised her hand. "I can cook some simple dishes." She secretly rejoiced—the cooking skills she'd honed in her past life to save money were finally coming in handy.

Olivia Davis twisted her fingers awkwardly. "I... I've never cooked before." She glanced at the others pleadingly. "I can help with prepping ingredients."

All eyes turned to Lucy White, who had yet to speak.

Michael Johnson's throat moved slightly. He remembered how skilled Lucy was in the kitchen and selfishly didn’t want her cooking for others. Yet the familiar aroma of her cooking seemed to already drift into his senses, leaving him conflicted.

"I can cook," Lucy said with a soft smile, breaking the silence.

Robert Lee made the decision. "Perfect! Then Lucy and Lily will be the main chefs, and the rest of us will assist."

Inside the kitchen, everyone froze at the sight of the primitive clay stove. There was no rice cooker—just a large black iron wok. Dry firewood was stacked beside the hearth, and not even a lighter was in sight.

Lily’s heart sank. This was nothing like what she’d imagined! But she had to keep smiling for the cameras. "Lucy, how should we divide the work?"

She deliberately tossed the challenge to Lucy, a glint of calculation in her eyes.

Lucy rolled up her sleeves calmly. "You choose."

"Well..." Lily quickly strategized. "For seven dishes, how about you handle the rice and three dishes, and I’ll take four?" She deliberately left the trickiest task—cooking rice—to Lucy.

"No problem," Lucy tied on her apron, moving as effortlessly as if she were in her own kitchen.

The live comments exploded:
[Lucy’s totally faking it! Just wait till she burns the rice—then we’ll see if she’s still smiling.]
[Lily’s so kind, taking on most of the work.]
[I bet five bucks Lucy has no idea how to use a clay stove.]

The male guests split firewood and struggled to start the fire. Ethan Smith rolled up his shirt sleeves, revealing well-defined forearms as he swung the axe with precision. Michael wasn’t far behind, logs splitting cleanly under his strikes.

But when Robert and William tried to light the fire, thick smoke instantly filled the kitchen. Lily choked, tears streaming as she covered her nose and fled outside.

Meanwhile, Lucy crouched down and effortlessly coaxed a strong flame to life. As the smoke cleared, she rinsed the rice with practiced ease, the grains glistening in the bamboo sieve.

[Holy crap, Lucy actually knows what she’s doing!]
[Where are the haters now? How’s that humble pie tasting?]
[The way she handles fire is so hot—help!]

Outside, Lily clenched her fists. She hadn’t expected Lucy to master even these primitive tools. No way—she couldn’t let her steal the spotlight!

"Need any help?" She forced a smile as she re-entered the kitchen, only to find Lucy already swiftly chopping ingredients. The rhythmic clatter of the knife against the board was crisp, the carrot slices so thin they were nearly translucent.

Lily’s smile stiffened. This opponent was proving far more formidable than she’d anticipated...
###Chapter 17: Culinary Showdown

"Cough! Cough!" Lily Green choked on the thick smoke, covering her mouth as she hurried out of the kitchen. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Lucy White effortlessly helping Robert Lee and his companion light the stove, and her heart sank.

Five minutes later, Lily reappeared at the kitchen doorway, forcing an apologetic smile. "I'm so sorry, everyone. I have mild asthma—I had to step out for a moment."

Robert waved it off. "No worries. Lucy already got it sorted for us."

Lily gritted her teeth. Lucy had stolen her moment. She plastered on a smile. "Shall I start cooking, then?"

"Go ahead," Robert said before heading out to the yard to help with other tasks.

Lily quickly snatched up the easiest ingredients—pork, chicken, eggs—then turned to Lucy. "Lucy, why don’t you handle the rice while I cook first?"

Lucy didn’t even look up. "Whatever." She glanced at the remaining fish and cured meat, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

[Wow, Lily’s fast!]
[Lucy’s so chill—I’d have argued over that.]

Lily had expected Lucy to snap, but her calm indifference only made her more frustrated. She huffed and started chopping the chicken, her knife skills visibly shaky.

Meanwhile, Lucy had already sliced the fish into perfect, paper-thin fillets with effortless precision.

[Her knife skills are insane!]
[Is Lucy a professional chef or something?]

Lily struggled with the heavy wok, nearly flipping the chicken out several times.

[Lily doesn’t seem used to cooking.]
[That wok’s tricky, but Lucy makes it look easy.]

Olivia Davis stood nearby, watching the contrast between them—Lucy moved like water, while beads of sweat formed on Lily’s forehead.

With a loud clang, Lily plated her spicy chicken, though the edges were burnt. She forced a smile and moved on to the next dish.

By then, Lucy had prepped all her ingredients. She pulled out a jar of pickled vegetables and began making Sichuan fish stew. Soon, the rich aroma filled the kitchen.

[My mouth is watering.]
[Lucy left half in the pot?]

Olivia tilted her head. "Why not serve it all?"

Lucy tossed in a handful of dried chili peppers. "This batch’s for those who like it extra spicy."

Olivia’s eyes lit up. "That’s so thoughtful!"

[Lucy’s considerate.]
[The difference is stark—Lily only catered to Ethan and Michael.]

Lily nearly dropped her spatula at the exchange. It dawned on her—she’d been so focused on impressing Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson that she’d ignored everyone else.

Two distinct scents mingled in the kitchen, an unspoken battle between the actresses. And in the livestream, the audience’s reactions painted a clear divide.
###Chapter 18: Culinary Mastery

Sizzle— The cured pork danced in the hot oil, golden fat seeping out as the aroma of green beans filled the kitchen.

Lucy White flipped her wrist with practiced ease, the spatula moving deftly in her hand. In moments, a glistening dish of cured pork with braised green beans was plated. Without pause, she stir-fried a vibrant plate of mustard greens, their glossy leaves shimmering with oil.

"That smells amazing!" Olivia Davis inhaled deeply, her stomach betraying her with an audible growl.

Lily Green stood to the side, her nails digging into her palms. Her own dishes—a fiery boiled fish and spicy chicken—sat untouched on the counter, their pools of red chili oil intimidating.

"Need any help?" Daniel Miller peeked in, his nose twitching. "That aroma’s driving everyone in the yard crazy."

Lily forced a smile. "Lucy and I just finished cooking."

"Thanks for the hard work, ladies." Daniel’s gaze flickered between two versions of Sichuan fish stew. "These are…?"

"One’s mild, the other regular spice," Lucy explained smoothly. "William and Olivia probably can’t handle too much heat."

At the dining table, William Jones was the first to try the fish. The moment it touched his tongue, his eyes lit up. "This fish is tender as tofu, and the pickled greens are perfect!"

"Really?" Robert Lee eyed him skeptically before taking a bite—then promptly couldn’t stop. "Holy—this is next-level!"

Ethan Smith picked up a slice of cured pork, its amber glaze catching the light. He chewed thoughtfully—then abruptly sped up, reaching for more.

"Save some for me!" Olivia nearly stood in her haste to grab another serving.

Lily’s dishes sat ignored at the far end of the table. Michael Johnson didn’t spare them a glance, too busy competing with Ethan for the last piece of pork.

[LMAO the way the guys are fighting over food like starved wolves]
[Lily’s face is greener than her untouched dishes]
[Is Lucy a professional chef? Look at them losing their minds]
[Who said Lucy couldn’t cook? Come take your L!]

"You’re amazing, Lucy," Lily said through gritted teeth, sweetness dripping from her voice. "City girls like me can’t even light a stove properly."

Lucy sipped her soup leisurely. "Guess I’m just naturally good at this."

"Drop the 'guess.'" Ethan’s rare smirk appeared. "You could open a restaurant with skills like this."

Lucy tilted her head. "So you’ll be a regular, Ethan?"

[OMG THE CHEMISTRY—]
[Since when does Ethan banter?? Is the sun rising in the west??]
[Lily’s face is a whole mood ring right now]
[Okay but Lucy’s charm is underrated. So genuine!]

As comments flooded the screen, Michael suddenly placed the last slice of pork on Lucy’s plate. "Eat up."

The table fell silent.

Lily’s chopsticks clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 19: No Need for Your Concern

The afternoon sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow on Lucy White’s face as she lazily scrolled through her phone. The trending topics about Lily Green had exploded online, with countless netizens now questioning her actions.

"Tsk. Can’t keep up the act anymore, huh?" Lucy smirked, then noticed faint wisps of white mist drifting away from Lily’s figure—her luck was draining.

A spark of satisfaction lit Lucy’s eyes. So, all it took to weaken Lily’s advantage was dismantling her "irresistible charm" persona. With a subtle flick of her fingers, Lucy traced an invisible sigil in the blind spot of the cameras.

"Let’s see you keep stealing others’ luck." She watched with satisfaction as the talisman dissolved into Lily’s back. It wouldn’t bring outright misfortune, but at least it would curb her unnaturally smooth sailing.

The hallway was empty during the midday break. Just as Lucy pushed open her door, a sickly sweet voice called from behind. "Lucy, can we talk?"

Lily stood there, putting on a pitiful act. "The trending topic really wasn’t my intention—"

"Stop." Lucy turned, her gaze icy. "No cameras here. Drop the act."

Lily’s expression twisted before she forced another smile. "I just wanted to explain—that night, Michael was the one who offered to help me—"

"Oh?" Lucy arched a brow. "So you came here to brag?"

She gave Lily a once-over and scoffed. "If Michael Johnson actually fell for someone like you, he’d have to be blind beyond saving."

Lily’s face turned livid, her nails digging into her palms.

"We’ll see about that!" She spun on her heel and stormed off.

Lucy slammed the door shut, humming cheerfully. She knew nothing stung Lily more than being called plain.

At the afternoon assembly, the director announced the team assignment rules. Michael immediately locked eyes with Lucy. "We’re a team."

Lily, standing nearby, froze mid-smile.

"Pass." Lucy didn’t even look up. "I don’t need to ride on your fame."

Michael’s brow furrowed. "I’m letting you."

The room fell silent. No one expected the top-tier celebrity to say something like that.

Lucy finally met his gaze, her tone indifferent. "No need for your concern."

The air turned frigid. Robert Lee coughed awkwardly, while Olivia Davis subtly gave Lucy a thumbs-up.

Seizing the moment, Lily sidled up to Michael. "Michael, maybe we could—"

"I’ll go solo." He cut her off coldly, though his eyes remained fixed on Lucy.

The director hurriedly intervened. "What about you, Ethan? Who would you like to team up with?"

Ethan Smith, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "I’ll pair with Lucy."

The livestream chat exploded.

[OMG! The Oscar winner actually asked her?!]
[What kind of insane luck does Lucy have?!]
[Lily’s face is literally green LOL]

Lucy blinked in surprise, then smiled when Ethan gave her a slight nod. "Sure. Thanks, Ethan."

Lily stood rigid, her nails nearly drawing blood. She could swear she saw another wisp of white mist slip away from her.
###Chapter 20: What Is She Up To?

The production crew watched the monitors, their grins stretching ear to ear. Today’s explosive moments were coming one after another—ratings were bound to skyrocket.

Sure enough, the live comments erupted instantly.

[Michael was kind enough to invite her, and she refused? How ungrateful!]

[What’s with the hard-to-get act? Who does she think she is?]

[A nobody trying to act like a diva? Pathetic!]

Lucy’s fans fired back just as fast.

[Like our Lucy needs your pity? Hilarious!]

[Some fans really think they own the place. Lucy’s better off staying away!]

[First, you accuse her of riding on clout, now you bash her for saying no? Hypocrites!]

Bystanders, utterly confused, scrambled to catch up on the drama. After piecing things together, they shook their heads.

[Michael’s fans are way too aggressive.]

[Poor Lucy. Damned if she does, damned if she doesn’t.]

Just as the comment war raged on, Ethan Smith suddenly approached Lucy.

"Want to team up?" His voice was gentle, his gaze sincere.

Lucy blinked in surprise, then smiled. "It’d be an honor to work with you, Mr. Smith."

They exchanged a look and shook hands, their chemistry undeniable.

[Aww, my king is so sweet!]

[Ethan’s such a gentleman!]

Haters wasted no time jumping in.

[Oh, so she’s just aiming higher? How predictable.]

[Gold-digger confirmed!]

But Ethan’s fans remained uncharacteristically calm.

[He offered first. Don’t twist it.]

[We’re not falling for this bait.]

Nearby, Lily Green stood rigid, her nails digging into her palms. Forcing a smile, she sidled up to Michael Johnson. "Mr. Johnson, shall we pair up?"

Michael’s eyes lingered on Lucy before he gave an absentminded nod.

[Lily’s such an angel!]

[Hope Michael doesn’t let her down!]

The other guests quickly formed their teams. Robert Lee joked, "Looks like we’re all on our own tonight."

Then the director dropped the bombshell. "Just a reminder—you’ll be cooking your own meals tonight. No outside help."

"What?!" The group groaned in unison.

Daniel Miller whined, "Director, that’s just cruel!"

Ethan chuckled. "Don’t worry. I’ll gather extra ingredients so Lucy can show off her skills."

[Ethan’s so protective!]

[This pairing has my heart!]

Once the others had scattered, Lucy suddenly paused. She scanned the area, her gaze settling on a pile of straw in the corner.

"Mr. Smith, could you wait for me?" She flashed a playful grin. "Just a minute."

Though puzzled, Ethan agreed easily. "Of course."

Viewers were baffled.

[Why isn’t she gathering ingredients?]

[What’s she scheming now?]

The camera lingered on Lucy’s enigmatic smile, leaving everyone wondering—

What is she up to?
###Chapter 21: A Stunning Display of Skill

"What's Lucy White up to now?" The live comments section was immediately flooded with trolls trying to stir up drama.

Even Ethan Smith's fans began to waver—had they misjudged Lucy all along?

The camera panned to show Lucy sitting in the courtyard with a bundle of straw in her lap, her slender fingers weaving with astonishing dexterity. Ethan sat beside her, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

"What is this...?" he murmured.

Without looking up, Lucy continued her swift movements. "A straw hat," she replied.

In just fifteen minutes, an exquisitely crafted straw hat took shape in her hands. She brushed off the loose strands and handed it to Ethan. "The sun's too harsh, Mr. Smith."

Ethan took the hat, examining it closely. This didn’t look hastily made—it was more refined than store-bought ones.

"You have this kind of skill?" he couldn’t help but praise.

Lucy smiled faintly. "I enjoy little crafts in my free time."

[Damn! That’s insane skill!]
[Who called Lucy just a pretty face? Come out and take the L!]
[That hat is gorgeous—I want one too!]

A second hat was soon finished. When the two stepped out wearing their handmade hats, they ran into Daniel Miller and his group, all drenched in sweat.

"Where’d you get those hats?" Daniel’s eyes gleamed with envy.

Ethan adjusted his brim with a smug grin. "Lucy made them."

"You can do this too, Lucy?" Olivia Davis gasped in amazement.

Lucy nodded warmly. "After we finish today’s task, I’ll make some for all of you."

[LMAO Daniel’s expression is killing me!]
[Ethan’s proud little smirk is adorable!]
[Lucy’s so sweet—I’m officially a fan!]

The pair arrived at a farmhouse where the owner was struggling to package fresh flowers.

"Want to give it a try?" Lucy glanced at Ethan.

He nodded. "Perfect timing."

The farmer eyed them skeptically. "Have you done this before?"

Lucy shook her head, but her hands moved with practiced ease. In moments, she transformed loose blooms into stunning bouquets, her speed astonishing.

"Young lady," the farmer suddenly asked, "do you recognize these flowers?"

The live comments exploded:
[Uh-oh, she’s about to get exposed.]
[No way anyone knows all these varieties.]

But Lucy simply smiled, pointing to the bouquet in her hands. "These are gardenias—the most fragrant." Then she gestured to another. "And those are pansies, perfect for drying."

She identified every flower in the yard with flawless precision, not missing even the rarest ones.

The farmer gaped. "Young lady, come take a look at these..."

(To be continued)
###Chapter 22: A Blooming Revelation

Lucy White gave a slight nod as she followed the host into the meticulously maintained garden. Rare flowers of every hue competed for attention under the sunlight, their delicate fragrance perfuming the air.

"Can you identify these camellia varieties?" the host asked, gesturing toward a vibrant patch of blooms.

"This one is 'Eighteen Scholars'—its petals are layered like a pagoda," Lucy murmured, lightly tracing a fingertip over the petals. "And that crimson one is 'Red Dawn,' its color like morning clouds. The 'Crown' has the most unique shape, resembling..."

She listed over thirty varieties with effortless precision, even pointing out the rarest hybrids. Ethan Smith had appeared beside her at some point, a flicker of admiration in his eyes.

This girl never failed to surprise him.

The host, intrigued, tested her knowledge on other flowers, and Lucy answered with ease. Soon, they were deep in discussion—soil pH, bloom cycles, every technical detail spot-on.

"My orchid has been sick for three months..." the host sighed suddenly.

Lucy crouched, examining it closely. "Root rot. You’ll need to trim all the decayed parts..." She demonstrated with practiced hands, moving like a seasoned gardener.

"Brilliant!" The host clapped in delight. "I’ve made a name for myself in horticulture, but you’re even more skilled than I am!"

The livestream erupted:

[Just looked it up—everything Lucy said was textbook-perfect!]
[Her orchid-trimming technique is flawless. My grandpa, who’s gardened for 40 years, says so!]
[How’s that for 'faking it,' haters?]

Flower enthusiasts chimed in:
[That root rot treatment is an advanced horticulturist’s trick!]
[She even knows hybrid genetics—no way this is last-minute studying!]

Casual viewers spammed the chat:
[Gorgeous, poised, AND a flower whisperer? What kind of goddess is this?!]
[Did you notice? She keeps including Ethan in the conversation. So thoughtful!]

As the sun dipped low, the pair returned with their haul. Wild honey glowed amber in the basket, and Ethan’s lips curved. "Looks like we’re eating well tonight."

"What would you like, Mr. Smith?" Lucy lifted the fresh ingredients playfully.

"I get to choose?" He raised a brow.

"If I can make it." Her eyes crinkled into crescents. Laughing, they headed back to the cottage—only to find Lily Green flaunting her fishing haul.

"Whoa! How’d you two get so much?" Daniel Miller gaped. The group marveled at their bounty while Lily’s smile stiffened.

Ethan explained warmly, "Lucy cured the host’s prized orchid." His gaze lingered on her, admiration undisguised. "Even professional gardeners couldn’t match her expertise."

Lily’s nails dug into her palms. She’d picked fishing—an easy crowd-pleaser—yet Lucy had stolen the spotlight again.

From the shadows, Michael Johnson’s stare burned into the laughing pair. When Ethan said "we," something in his chest twisted sharply.

Dinner aromas soon had everyone restless. Daniel hovered at the kitchen door, pleading, "Lucy, any scraps for a starving man?"

Lucy glanced at Ethan, who gave an indulgent nod. "Your call."

"Then... sharing is caring?" She winked. Cheers erupted—but no one noticed Lily’s darkening glare or Michael’s smoldering silence.
###Chapter 23: We Can't Go Back

Lucy White prepared a lavish spread—seven dishes and a soup—that left the guest stars raving over the fragrant feast.

"Now this is real food. What we had earlier was practically animal feed," Daniel Miller remarked, savoring a piece of braised pork with his eyes half-closed in satisfaction.

"Good thing I didn’t eat much at lunch. Now I get to enjoy Lucy’s cooking," William Jones said between mouthfuls, his cheeks stuffed as he polished off his second bowl of rice.

"This is Michelin-star level," Robert Lee praised, biting into a crispy sweet-and-sour spare rib glazed in tangy sauce before giving an approving thumbs-up.

Lucy smiled faintly. "I’m glad you like it."

Cooking had always been her passion, and in her past life, she had trained under master chefs for years. Seeing everyone enjoy the meal warmed her heart.

The livestream chat exploded with comments like "I want a bite!"—viewers could practically smell the aromas through their screens.

After dinner, the group gathered in the courtyard to sip tea and digest. Lucy brought out a bundle of straw and began weaving with nimble fingers.

"Wow, Lucy, you can do this too?" Daniel crouched beside her, eyes wide with amazement.

The straw danced between her fingertips, quickly taking shape as an elegant straw hat. William tried it on. "This is incredible—better than store-bought ones!"

Aside from Lily Green’s forced smile, the others praised her genuinely. Lucy accepted the compliments graciously, crafting a few more hats and leaving them on the stone bench for anyone to take.

[Lucy’s so talented!]
[Are those hands blessed by fairies?]
[Officially a fan—her personality’s amazing.]

Late that night, after the livestream ended, Lucy was the last to head upstairs. At the stairwell, a figure blocked her path.

"We need to talk," Michael Johnson said, his voice rough.

Lucy sidestepped him. "There’s nothing to discuss."

"I’m sorry." He caught her wrist. "I didn’t know the trending scandal would get you so much hate."

It was a belated apology—one she had waited for in vain in her past life, even as she stood on that rooftop. She pulled free. "The damage is done."

"I only asked you to confirm the photo because I didn’t want rumors with Lily," Michael explained urgently. "I never meant to hurt you."

He stepped closer, pleading. "Can’t we start over?"

"No." Her reply was absolute.

Michael stiffened as if doused in ice water. "Why? Just because of this?"

"Not just this." Lucy met his gaze evenly. "You grew colder after we started dating. Now that we’ve broken up, we’re both free."

"I wasn’t cold!" His voice shook. "I just... wasn’t good at showing it."

He reached for her, but she evaded his touch. "I’ll change. I’ll treat you like before. Give me one more chance, please?"

"No." Lucy retreated another step. "Michael, we can’t go back."

Seeing his reddened eyes, she remembered the despair of that rooftop. Some wounds couldn’t be erased with an apology.

"If you really care, stay out of the trending mess," she said, turning away.

Michael rushed to promise, "I’ll do whatever you say."

"Goodnight." Without looking back, Lucy shut her door, leaving Michael alone in the hallway—abandoned, like a lost child.
###Chapter 24: Heartbeats at Dawn

At exactly 5:30 a.m., Lucy White’s internal clock woke her. She slipped out of bed quietly, careful not to disturb her roommate, Lily Green. Pushing open the window, she inhaled the crisp mountain air, still thick with morning mist, as a breeze carrying the scent of fresh grass brushed against her cheeks.

Ding. Her phone screen lit up with a message from Sophia Taylor: Richard Brown contacted three gossip accounts last night. They’re planning to drop dirt on you today.

A faint smile curved Lucy’s lips as her slender fingers typed a swift reply: Let them. It’ll set the stage for us. After sending it, she changed into workout clothes and headed downstairs.

In the kitchen, the production crew’s cameraman was already in position. Livestream viewers were startled when a slender figure suddenly appeared on screen.

[OMG! Is that Lucy? Her bare face is unreal!]
[I’m so jealous of her skin—it literally glows!]
[Who wakes up at 5:30 a.m.? This is next-level discipline!]

Lucy tied on an apron with practiced ease and began preparing breakfast. She peeled and chopped pumpkin, rinsed rice, her movements fluid and effortless. Humming softly, she kneaded dough, her fingers deftly shaping delicate buns that soon filled the steamer.

"Ms. White, you’re up early," the director remarked.

Lucy turned with a smile, morning light spilling through the window onto her face. "Old habit. The air’s best at this hour."

[I’M DEAD. That smile just killed me.]
[Is she an actual angel?]
[Okay, I suddenly see the hype about Lucy’s looks.]

While waiting for the steamer, Lucy wiped her hands and stepped outside for a jog—only to nearly collide with Ethan Smith, clad in workout gear, stretching by the door.

Their eyes met, and both froze for a heartbeat.

"Morning," Ethan said, his voice still rough with sleep.

Lucy nodded. "You run too?"

"Join me?" He gestured toward the path.

They fell into an easy rhythm, maintaining a comfortable distance as they jogged down the country lane. The mist gradually lifted, golden sunlight dappling their figures through the trees.

[This is too aesthetically pleasing.]
[Why do they look so good together?]
[Ethan’s gaze at Lucy is… interesting.]

By the time they returned, the other guests were stirring. Daniel Miller shuffled into the dining room, rubbing his eyes, then perked up at the aroma. "Wow, Lucy! You’re amazing!"

Robert Lee didn’t wait, snagging a steamed bun. "This is insane. Thin wrapper, juicy filling—perfect."

Olivia Davis sipped her pumpkin porridge, eyes closing in contentment. "Just the right sweetness. Comfort in a bowl."

Even the notoriously picky William Jones devoured three buns. "Lucy, you’re wasting your talent not opening a restaurant."

From the staircase, Lily watched the scene, her nails digging into her palms. Richard promised to release damaging rumors today—why hasn’t it happened yet?

"Lily, come eat!" Daniel called.

Instantly, Lily’s face brightened with a practiced smile. "Coming! Thanks, Lucy. You’re so sweet." She picked up a bun—then nearly gagged. Mushroom filling. Her least favorite.

Livestream viewers caught the slip:
[Lily’s mask just slipped.]
[That disgusted look was obvious.]
[Rude much? She worked hard on this.]

Lucy noted everything, her lips quirking imperceptibly. She’d known about Lily’s aversion from her social media—hence the extra mushrooms. Watching Lily force a smile, Lucy happily served herself another bowl of porridge.

As dawn fully broke, the day began in earnest. No one noticed how Ethan’s gaze kept drifting toward the busy, graceful figure in the kitchen.
###Chapter 25: She Would Defy Expectations This Time

Morning sunlight spilled into the courtyard as Lucy White set down her coffee cup. The director strode in with a group of people trailing behind him.

"Everyone, the trainees have arrived," the director announced, clapping his hands. "For the next three days, you eight will be mentoring them."

Daniel Miller scratched his head. "How exactly are we supposed to mentor them?"

The director explained, "The forty trainees will be divided into eight groups of five. In three days, they'll perform a countryside-themed song and dance. You'll serve as both guests and mentors."

Robert Lee raised an eyebrow. "No pressure at all."

Lily Green suddenly interjected, her voice sweet but her eyes sharp with calculation. "How will the groups be decided? Do we choose, or do they?"

[Lily’s trying too hard.]
[The least famous one here, yet she acts like the center of attention.]

Lucy watched Lily’s performance coldly. After losing face in yesterday’s cooking challenge, the woman was clearly trying to regain ground elsewhere.

The director feigned hesitation. "Any suggestions?"

Lily immediately spoke up. "How about we spend half a day getting to know them, then let the trainees pick their mentors in the afternoon? The mentors can then make their final selections." She straightened confidently, certain her charm would attract the most trainees.

The director’s eyes lit up—this idea was dramatic enough to spark buzz.

But William Jones and the others frowned. It was obvious most trainees would flock to Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson. Wouldn’t that leave the rest of them embarrassed?

"What if everyone picks Mr. Smith and Mr. Johnson?" Daniel joked.

The director tossed the question back to Lily. "Ms. Green, what do you think?"

Lily was prepared. "We can do multiple rounds. Those who aren’t picked in the first round can choose another mentor."

The trainees exchanged uneasy glances, torn between excitement and anxiety.

"I disagree," Lucy suddenly said, her voice crisp.

Lily’s smile froze. She hadn’t expected Lucy to openly oppose her.

"Ms. White, do you have a better idea?" Lily forced a smile, though her eyes turned cold.

Lucy replied calmly, "Half a day isn’t enough to get to know anyone. Letting trainees choose will only cause chaos. A random draw would be fairer and more efficient."

She remembered how, in her past life, Lily had used this exact tactic to snatch the best trainees, leaving her with five troublemakers. That group’s poor performance had cost her dearly.

This time, she would defy expectations.

Lily gritted her teeth. Since when had Lucy become so difficult to handle?

The director stroked his chin. A random draw was fair, but lacked drama...

"I think Lucy makes a valid point," Ethan, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "A draw is the fairest method."

The moment the award-winning actor voiced his opinion, the atmosphere shifted.

Lily paled. Her carefully laid plan had just been effortlessly dismantled by Lucy.

A faint smile curved Lucy’s lips. In this second life, she wouldn’t let Lily have her way. Every time she disrupted the script, Lily’s influence weakened.

This battle had only just begun.
###Chapter 26: Clash of Wills

Lily Green curled her lips in a mocking smile after hearing Lucy White's suggestion. This woman must be afraid no one will choose her, she thought.

"Drawing lots is so boring," Lily said, tossing her hair. "Mutual selection is much more exciting."

She turned to the others with expectant eyes. "What do you think, everyone?"

Ethan Smith tapped the table lightly with his long fingers, his voice cool. "I support Lucy. All forty trainees are outstanding. Forcing us to pick just five would be unfair."

His gaze swept over Lily, carrying a silent warning.

Lily's heart tightened. Ethan is actually defending Lucy?

Unwilling to back down, she turned to Michael Johnson. "Michael, what's your opinion?"

A sudden thought flashed through Michael's mind: I should side with Lily. But when his eyes landed on Lucy's indifferent profile, an inexplicable pang shot through his chest.

"Let's draw lots," he heard himself say. "It's the fairest way."

Lily's eyes widened. Even Michael is taking Lucy's side?

She didn't notice the wisp of white mist dissipating from her body.

"If both of you insist..." She forced a smile. "Then we'll do it your way."

Robert Lee and the others exchanged displeased glances. This woman didn't even ask for our input?

Lucy spoke up at just the right moment. "Do any of you have suggestions? My idea might not be the best."

Daniel Miller immediately chimed in. "Drawing lots sounds great—let fate decide!"

Robert and the rest nodded in agreement, their eyes warming toward Lucy.

Only then did Lily realize—Lucy just outmaneuvered me!

The live comments exploded:
[Lily's so self-centered]
[The favoritism is obvious]
[Lucy has way better emotional intelligence]

Seeing the tension, the director quickly mediated. "Then it's settled. First, we'll draw numbers for order, then mentors."

As the drawing began, Lucy subtly flicked her fingers. The most troublesome trainee inexplicably pulled Lily's name.

His face stiffened, then relaxed. At least it's not Lucy.

Lucy didn't interfere with the rest of the draws.

Some connections were better left to fate.
###Chapter 27: Unbelievable Luck

The draw results were announced quickly, and Lucy White's team ended up with two notoriously difficult trainees from her past life.

One was the carefree rich heir Ryan Clark, the other a wildcard with mysterious connections—Jason Wright. Their backgrounds hadn't been exposed yet, so they blended in among the trainees.

The remaining three were more manageable: timid Noah Adams, cheerful college student Lucas Young, and the gentle older-brother figure Benjamin Harris.

Lucas was the most popular, ranked 19th. Jason was 22nd, Benjamin 29th, Ryan 33rd, and Noah trailed at 36th.

"Talk about luck..." Ryan muttered, staring at his slip with a bitter smile.

The other trainees shot him sympathetic looks. Online rumors painted Lucy as nothing more than a pretty face—following her probably meant an early elimination.

"We're doomed," Noah whispered, his eyes reddening.

The director announced the mission: "Today, mentors will lead their teams in helping villagers sell goods. You keep 10% of the profits as payment. Use the earnings to buy lunch, then cook dinner yourselves with ingredients you purchase."

"What are we selling? And where?" Robert Lee asked.

"Negotiate with the villagers for products. Selling location is the county town," the director added. "No discounts or promotions allowed."

Daniel Miller groaned. "So much for the peaceful rural life..."

Groups began leaving one after another, soon leaving only four teams in the courtyard.

Lily Green sidled up to Michael Johnson. "Michael, should we sell fish?"

She was hopeful—they'd worked well together yesterday.

But Michael suddenly winced, a voice in his head urging him to agree. Suppressing the discomfort, he shook his head. "No. I have other plans."

With that, he put on the straw hat Lucy had woven and walked off.

Lily froze, a wisp of white mist dissipating from her.

Lucy smirked. Without the book's influence, Michael no longer blindly indulged Lily.

Undeterred, Lily turned to Ethan Smith. "Ethan, want to sell fish together?"

"Pass." Ethan strode straight to Lucy. "Interested in selling flowers?"

"Sure." Lucy glanced at her team. "What do you all think?"

Ryan shrugged lazily. "Your call."

The other four nodded. Only a fool would turn down screen time with a top-tier celebrity like Ethan.

Ethan handed her a straw hat. "Let's go."

The two groups set off, leaving Lily's team standing awkwardly behind.

"We'll sell fish!" Lily forced a smile, pointedly ignoring Lucy's hats.

Her trainees exchanged uneasy glances but had no choice but to follow under the scorching sun.

The livestream chat exploded:
[Ethan initiated the invite?!]
[Michael actually rejected Lily?]
[Lily's face is greener than the fish! LOL]
###Chapter 28: An Unexpected Windfall

Lily Green arrived at the fishing spot early in the morning with her trainees in tow. She had already arranged everything with the pond owner beforehand and urged everyone to get to work as soon as they arrived.

"We need to catch as many fish as possible today," she muttered under her breath, biting her lip. "I can't let Lucy steal the spotlight again."

The thought of Lucy's recent successes made her chest tighten. She had hoped to embarrass Lucy on the show, but instead, the woman had shone brighter than ever. What made it worse was how Michael Johnson and Ethan Smith treated Lucy with obvious favor.

"Work faster!" she called out, raising her voice. "Let's fill as many baskets as we can before noon."

[Why is Lily in such a hurry today?]
[She seems like she's trying too hard.]
[Is she competing with Lucy?]

Meanwhile, Lucy and Ethan led their group toward a farmhouse. Along the way, Lucy patiently explained local customs to the trainees, occasionally cracking jokes to lighten the mood.

"I noticed the flowers here are especially beautiful yesterday," Lucy said with a smile. "I'll show you later."

Ethan added, "Ms. White knows a lot about flowers."

Their seamless teamwork put the trainees at ease, and they chatted happily as they walked.

When they entered the courtyard, they found Michael deep in conversation with an elderly man. Spotting Lucy, his eyes lit up, and he quickly approached.

"Here to buy flowers too?" he asked, hopeful.

Lucy took a subtle step back. "You're fast, Mr. Johnson."

The old man chuckled. "Young Michael knows his flowers. I agreed to let him take some to sell."

"That's great," Lucy said, turning to the old man. "Could we take a look at the potted landscapes?"

"Potted landscapes?" The man looked surprised. "Those aren't usually for sale."

Seeing Lucy's disappointed expression, he relented. "But since you asked, I'll make an exception."

"Thank you so much!" Lucy's eyes curved into crescents.

Michael's expression darkened. "Lucy, we could—"

"No need," she interrupted. "You sell flowers, we'll sell potted landscapes. No overlap."

Ethan smoothly cut in, "That sounds fair."

Michael stared at Ethan for a few seconds before finally conceding. "Fine. Whatever you say."

The trainees exchanged glances—this was nothing like the rumors online. Michael was clearly the one pursuing Lucy, yet she kept her distance.

[Wow, Lucy is bold!]
[Michael looks so dejected.]
[Ethan protecting Lucy is so hot!]

As Lucy selected the potted landscapes, she explained each one in detail while demonstrating proper care. The trainees listened intently, fascinated. Ethan handled the heavy lifting, their coordination flawless.

On the other side, Michael sullenly directed his group to load the flowers onto their cart. Before leaving, he couldn't resist turning back. "Aren’t you coming with us?"

"We still have things to do," Lucy replied without looking up.

Once Michael was gone, Ethan grinned. "What's the plan now?"

"I found a cherry orchard during my morning run," Lucy said with a secretive wink. "We can pick some to sell alongside the potted landscapes."

Ethan laughed in realization. "So that's why you were chatting with the villagers earlier—gathering intel."

"It's called being prepared," Lucy said, tilting her chin up proudly.

They shared a smile, the sunlight casting a golden glow over them—a picture-perfect moment that was impossible to look away from.

[I ship this couple so hard!]
[Lucy is so clever!]
[Can't wait to see their cherry business!]
###Chapter 29: Lucy's Hidden Talent

Morning sunlight streamed through the car window, casting a golden glow on Lucy White's delicate profile as she deftly wove strands of straw. The livestream chat exploded with excitement.

[OMG! She actually remembers the way back?]
[Her memory is insane!]
[No way. Waiting for her to mess up.]

Jason Wright tightened his grip on the steering wheel, glancing at her skeptically. "Ms. White, are you sure you remember the route?"

Without looking up, Lucy continued weaving. "Turn left."

The car veered onto a narrow country road. Noah Adams leaned forward curiously. "Ms. White, what are you making?"

"Our secret weapon for selling cherries," she replied with a playful wink.

Ryan Clark, lounging in his seat with a piece of straw between his teeth, smirked. "Let me guess—a straw hat?"

"Wrong." Lucy chuckled as the straw took shape in her hands.

[Ahhh! So excited!]
[Her fingers move so fast!]
[How many hidden talents does she have?!]

Benjamin Harris suddenly pointed ahead. "Hey, isn’t that the crooked tree we passed earlier?"

The group gasped—Lucy’s directions had been flawless.

Lucas Young’s eyes widened. "Ms. White, you actually memorized the whole route?"

"Mhm." She finally looked up. "Take a right up ahead, and we’ll reach town."

Jason’s knuckles whitened around the wheel, disbelief written across his face.

[No freaking way! She did it!]
[What kind of superhuman memory is this?!]
[Bet the haters are crying right now.]

Noah stared in awe at the delicate straw basket forming in Lucy’s hands. "Ms. White, can you teach us?"

"Of course." She slowed her movements. "Watch closely—first, you do this..."

Ryan suddenly spat out his straw and scooted closer. "Let me try."

[LMAO the tsundere act is crumbling!]
[Ryan, your tough-guy image is ruined!]
[Lucy’s charm is too powerful.]

By the time the car rolled into town, Lucy had finished three intricately woven baskets, each adorned with wildflowers.

Noah swallowed hard. "Are we... really using these to sell cherries?"

Lucy grinned mischievously. "No. These are our secret weapons."

[Ohhh! It’s a marketing strategy!]
[Her business sense is next-level.]
[Is there anything this woman can’t do?]

Jason parked and turned to face her. "Ms. White, seriously—what can’t you do?"

Tying a final ribbon on the last basket, Lucy winked. "That’s classified."

[AHHH! That wink killed me!]
[This woman is dangerously charming.]
[Officially a fan now.]

Meanwhile, the livestream viewer count skyrocketed. No one had expected a talent show mentor to captivate the entire audience—armed with nothing but straw and an impeccable memory.
###Chapter 30: Undeniable Talent

"Ugh, why are these vines so stubborn!" Lucas Young fumbled with the tangled strands, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Lucy White chuckled softly. "Take your time." Her slender fingers wove through the vines with effortless grace.

Benjamin Harris stared at his lopsided half-finished basket and groaned. "Miss White, why does mine look like a crooked tree?"

Noah Adams burst out laughing. "Mine's no better—it resembles a squashed mushroom."

The livestream comments exploded:

[LMAO this isn't basket-weaving, it's abstract art!]
[Noah's mushroom comparison is spot-on, I'm dying!]
[Lucy's hands are magic. The contrast is brutal.]

Lucy patiently guided each of them. "Lucas, pull this tighter. Benjamin, adjust the angle here."

Suddenly, the car hit a bump, sending Noah's half-finished basket flying.

"My basket!" He lunged forward with a dramatic wail.

Jason Wright slammed the brakes, exasperated. "You guys are performing acrobatics now?"

Lucy caught the airborne "art piece" with lightning reflexes, barely suppressing a laugh. "Seatbelts first, weaving later."

[I can't breathe, this is too funny!]
[This moment will live in my mind rent-free.]
[Lucy's reflexes are insane!]

Once back on the road, the group focused seriously on weaving. Gradually, their misshapen baskets began taking form.

"Oh my god, I actually made one!" Lucas held up his creation, beaming like a child.

Benjamin rubbed his chin. "It's ugly, but at least it holds things."

Noah suddenly grinned. "Let's name them! Mine's 'Abstract Art Basket.'"

Lucy played along. "Then mine should be 'Soullessly Perfect Basket.'"

[Lucy's comedic timing is gold!]
[This group's chemistry is everything.]
[This is what reality shows should be like!]

Jason gasped. "We're here!" He stared at the GPS in disbelief. "Miss White, you didn't miss a single turn!"

Lucy blinked innocently. "Did you doubt me?"

"I'm officially impressed," Jason admitted, giving a thumbs-up. "Your memory is unreal."

The comments went wild:

[I counted—eleven forks in the road!]
[Does Lucy have a built-in GPS?]
[Where are the haters now? Who said she'd get lost?]

The production crew waited at the town entrance. The director raised an eyebrow as Lucy's team arrived first. "You didn't take one wrong turn?"

Lucy lifted her chin proudly. "Of course not."

The director handed them four cards. "Congratulations on earning first pick."

Instead of deciding alone, Lucy turned to her team. "Where should we choose?"

Ryan Clark blurted, "People call Miss White bossy? What nonsense!"

[Ryan speaks his mind, LOL!]
[This guy has no filter, I love it.]
[But he's right though.]

They unanimously picked the busiest square downtown. Just as they finalized their choice, Ethan Smith's team pulled up behind them.

"Seems we chose the right people to follow," Ethan said, his gaze lingering on Lucy.

She smiled back. "Looking forward to working together."

[Ethan's eyes when he looks at Lucy—]
[This ship has sailed!]
[Smart move, Ethan. Never let go of that advantage.]

Lily Green's team arrived third. Her smile stiffened upon seeing the prime location taken.

"Let's pick the open market," she told Michael Johnson, forcing cheerfulness.

Michael watched Lucy and Ethan walk away, a sour taste in his mouth. "Yeah."

Later arrivals gasped upon hearing Lucy navigated flawlessly.

Daniel Miller slapped his thigh. "I'm sticking to Lucy like glue tomorrow!"

Robert Lee nodded vigorously. "Same!"

William Jones groaned. "Should've followed Ethan's lead this morning!"

[Everyone's a Lucy fan now!]
[Ethan: Too late, she's mine.]
[The turnaround is delicious.]

Meanwhile, Lucy and her team reached the bustling square, ready to begin their "business venture."

"Ready?" She scanned the group, eyes sparkling with confidence.

"Ready!" they chorused.

Viewers eagerly typed:

[Go go go! Show us how it's done!]
[This is the ultimate sales dream team.]
[With Ethan and Lucy together, who can compete?]
###Chapter 31: A Heartwarming Assist

The morning sun bathed the square in golden light as Lucy White and her team arrived at their designated spot, pulling a small cart laden with cherries and potted landscapes.

"This location is way too out of the way," Lucas Young muttered, eyeing the large tree at the corner of the square with frustration.

The production crew had assigned them the farthest edge of the plaza, where only a few elderly women sat with their grandchildren, seeking shade. Nearby, other cherry vendors bustled with customers, their stalls thriving.

Lucy set down the last basket of cherries and dusted her hands. "Now it's your turn."

"Us?" Jason Wright pointed at himself in surprise. "Aren’t we selling these together?"

"Of course, but this is your chance to shine." Lucy winked, then lowered her voice, covering her mic. "Want more screen time? Put in the effort—audiences love watching rookies work hard."

The trainees froze. Weren’t people always saying Lucy hogged the spotlight? Why was she giving them the opportunity now?

Ethan Smith, standing nearby, let a faint smile touch his lips. He stepped closer to Lucy. "Need help?"

"I was thinking of making something with these straw ropes." She twirled the strands in her hand. "Care to join, Ethan?"

"Gladly." He settled beside her, accepting the straw she handed him.

Under the shade of the tree, the two wove baskets together, their quiet collaboration painting a serene and picturesque scene.

Meanwhile, Jason and the others were struggling.

"Ma'am, our cherries are incredibly sweet. Would you like to try one?" Nathan King offered with a hopeful smile.

The elderly woman shook her head. "Too expensive. The stall up front sells them for five dollars less."

A full half-hour passed, and they had only sold two pounds of cherries. The potted landscapes remained untouched.

[Live comments exploded:]
[LOL, these guys look so adorably lost!]
[Why isn’t Lucy helping? Just lazing around as usual.]
[Hey, don’t jump to conclusions—I saw Lucy whispering something to them earlier.]
[Lip-reader here: She was teaching them how to get more screen time!]
[Wow, that’s actually really sweet of her.]

"This isn’t working," Lucas groaned, running a hand through his hair. "Maybe we should ask Lucy for advice."

By the time they reached the tree, Ethan had just finished a small basket.

"Ethan, we can’t sell anything," Noah Adams admitted, his expression crestfallen.

Ethan glanced toward the bustling crowd. "You need to draw people in first."

"But we’ve been calling out to them for ages with no luck," Nathan sighed.

Lucy looked up. "Don’t you all have talents?"

"Talents?" The trainees exchanged confused looks.

"Exactly." Her eyes sparkled. "Singing, dancing—anything. Ask the crew for a speaker, and you’ll definitely attract attention."

She gestured to the woven baskets. "And you can run a promotion—buy cherries, get a handmade basket free."

The realization hit them like a lightning bolt.

"Oh!" Lucy added suddenly, "Who here is good at drawing or calligraphy?"

Noah raised his hand. "I can sketch."

"Perfect!" Lucy grinned. "Use your earnings to buy some paper and pens."

[The livestream erupted again:]
[Lucy’s creating opportunities for the rookies!]
[Where are the people who said she hogs the spotlight? Apologize!]
[Noah can draw? Can’t wait to see!]
[This move is seriously winning me over.]

Jason and the others hurried off, energized by the new plan. Beneath the tree, Lucy and Ethan shared a quiet smile before returning to their weaving. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled patterns over them.
###Chapter 32: This Is Too Wild

"We need to do something different!" Lucy White clapped her hands, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

The trainees sprang into action, borrowing a sound system in less than ten minutes. The production crew had provided two phones—one for playing music.

"Not everyone can perform," Lucy reminded them. "We need to split into teams to sell the cherries and potted landscapes."

Her words struck a chord. Soon, two teams had chosen their leaders—Benjamin Harris and Nathan King.

Someone returned with paper and pens. Lucy carefully explained the care instructions for each plant, having the trainees with good handwriting jot them down. The livestream camera zoomed in on these notes.

"Noah, sketch this," Lucy said, pulling up photos of blooming flowers on her phone.

Meanwhile, the performance had already begun.

Ryan Clark took the mic as the host, his booming voice drawing a crowd in the square. Jason Wright and another trainee kicked things off with a breakdance routine, instantly electrifying the atmosphere.

After Lucas Young finished singing a love ballad, he smoothly transitioned into promoting the cherries: "Buy three pounds and get a handmade woven basket!"

The tactic worked like a charm. Customers quickly gathered, and Benjamin’s team was soon swamped.

"No more baskets?" A latecomer complained.

Benjamin wiped sweat from his brow, panicked—until Lucy stepped in. "Don’t worry, we can make them right now!"

She signaled Lucas and a few others to demonstrate basket-weaving on the spot. The growing crowd watched in fascination, with many young women filming the process on their phones.

Nathan seized the moment to pitch the potted plants. Each one came with care instructions and a comparison chart of its blooming potential, drawing plenty of interest.

"What’s the free gift with the plant?" someone teased.

Lucy winked. "Handmade trinkets!"

She guided the trainees in crafting small souvenirs, and soon, onlookers were joining in, eager to try their hand at it.

The live comments exploded:
[Lucy’s skills are insane!]
[What the heck is Ryan making? LOL]
[Nathan just got roasted by an auntie, I can’t—]
[This is too wild!]

In under an hour, everything sold out. Disappointed customers asked if they’d return the next day.

Lucy used the leftover materials to weave flower crowns for the children in the crowd. The heartwarming interactions sent the trainees’ popularity soaring.

By just past noon, the mission was complete. The group decided to grab lunch.

"I know a great local spot," Lucy said, checking her phone for directions.

As they headed to the restaurant, Lucy suddenly stopped a couple carrying a sleeping child. "Wait a second!"

Her gaze locked onto the seemingly peaceful child.
###Chapter 33: The Traffickers Exposed

"Stop!" Lucy White stepped forward, blocking the pair.

The woman took a wary step back, clutching the unconscious child tighter. "What do you want?"

Lucy's gaze locked onto the limp child in her arms. "Is this your kid?"

"Of course!" The woman's eyes darted nervously, but her voice rose sharply. "Who else's would it be?"

The middle-aged man beside her glared viciously. "Are you insane? Get out of our way!"

[What’s Lucy doing?]
[She’s stopping them when their kid’s sick? That’s messed up.]
[Wait, that guy looks terrifying.]

Lucy smirked. "Judging by your faces, you're not married, and this child isn’t yours."

"Bullshit!" The man suddenly yanked a gleaming machete from his bag. "Move or I’ll cut you down!"

The crowd erupted in panic.

Screams filled the air as bystanders scattered.

Ethan Smith lunged forward, but Lucy held him back.

In a flash, she pivoted and delivered a sharp side kick.

Clang! The machete clattered to the ground.

Before the man could react, Lucy flipped him over her shoulder, slamming him onto the pavement.

"Police! Run!" The woman shrieked and suddenly hurled the child into the air.

"Look out!" Ethan dove, catching the child just in time.

The woman bolted.

"After her!" Ryan Clark and several trainees gave chase.

Jason Wright tackled her mid-sprint, pinning her down.

"Let me go!" The woman thrashed wildly.

Lucy loomed over the subdued man. "Talk. Where did you kidnap this child from?"

His face paled.

"Y-you’re insane!" he stammered, though sweat beaded on his forehead.

Lucy crouched, yanking open the child’s collar to reveal red marks.

"Drug residue," she said coldly. "And this—"

She pulled a slip of paper from the child’s shoe—a phone number and the words $5 million scrawled across it.

"Kidnapping and ransom. The evidence speaks for itself."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

The man’s face turned ghostly white.
###Chapter 34: The Oracle's Power

Police sirens wailed as two officers rushed to the scene.

"Who called this in? What happened?" the lead officer demanded in a low voice.

Noah Adams stepped forward, detailing Lucy White's uncanny prediction and the harrowing events that had just unfolded.

Lucy's sharp gaze locked onto the subdued man on the ground. "This one has blood on his hands. Run his records—you'll see."

Without hesitation, the officer pulled out handcuffs and secured the suspect.

"Wait!" The older cop's eyes widened. "Doesn't this guy match that fugitive from our county?"

The younger officer quickly cross-referenced the database and gasped. "It's him—the murderer who's been on the run for five years!"

Both officers stared at Lucy in disbelief. "Miss, you really identified him just by reading his face?"

Lucy gave a slight nod.

"Then... could you read mine?" the younger officer ventured hesitantly.

Lucy glanced at him. "Full forehead, ears higher than eyebrows—a principled man with good fortune."

"Ha! Officer Lee here is the best mediator in our precinct," the older cop remarked, astonished.

"A new horizontal line in your children's sector..." Lucy suddenly smiled. "Congratulations. Your wife is expecting."

The young officer paled. "That's impossible! She just tested positive yesterday—I haven't told anyone!"

Just then, a heart-wrenching scream pierced the air.

"Xiao Bao! Where's my Xiao Bao?" An elderly woman stumbled forward, frantic.

Ethan Smith stood, cradling a child. "Is this him?"

The grandmother snatched the boy into her arms, weeping uncontrollably. "My precious grandson!"

A middle-aged couple rushed up behind her, their eyes red-rimmed. The mother took the child but panicked when he remained unconscious.

"Don't worry." Lucy stepped closer, gently pinching the boy's earlobe. "Just a sedative. He'll wake soon."

Her gaze then shifted to a cowering woman in the corner. "That's your sister, isn't it? She conspired with this murderer to kidnap your son."

The accused woman turned ghostly white and bolted.

"You monster!" The mother lunged, grabbing her sister's hair and slapping her twice. "I clothed and fed you, and you dare harm my child?"

"Sis, I'm sorry! He forced me!" the sister wailed.

"Liar!" The father kicked her away. "You knew I was the one who reported Li Dali's crimes, yet you helped him target my son!"

Years ago, he had been the whistleblower that exposed the killer's atrocities.

Police hauled both women away in cuffs. The father turned and bowed deeply to Lucy. "We owe you everything."

Lucy waved it off. "Just get your son checked at the hospital."

As if on cue, the child in the grandmother's arms stirred, letting out a loud, healthy cry.

The family wept with joy, showering Lucy with gratitude before hurrying away with their miracle.
###Chapter 35: Something You Can't Have

After the child regained consciousness, the family repeatedly thanked Lucy White and Ethan Smith before rushing to the hospital for a full checkup.

Once the crowd dispersed, the nearby residents immediately swarmed around Lucy.

"That was incredible, young lady!"
"If it weren't for you, that child would’ve been in real danger."
"Who knew someone so young could read fortunes? Can you take a look at mine?"
"Sweetheart, are you seeing anyone? Auntie knows a great match for you!"

Meanwhile, Ethan was also surrounded by enthusiastic older women, all eager to set him up.

Lucy smiled politely. "Sorry, we still have things to do." Exchanging a glance with Ethan, the two smoothly led their trainees away.

"Miss White, that move was amazing!" Ryan Clark’s eyes sparkled. "Have you trained before?"

Jason Wright chimed in, "And Mr. Smith—that catch was pure instinct!"

Lucy flexed her wrist. "I studied martial arts and taekwondo for a few years." It was true—she’d been bullied in middle school for her looks and later toughened up with self-defense. After traveling through multiple worlds, her skills had only sharpened.

"Funny, I’ve trained too," Ethan said with a light chuckle.

Lucy’s eyes lit up. She held out her hand. "Paw shake!"
Ethan played along, clasping her hand. "Paw shake!"

The live comments exploded:
[OMG Lucy is a queen!]
[That move was everything!]
[Ethan catching the kid—my heart can’t take it!]
[They’re so perfect together!]
[Lucy, read my fortune next!]
[Haters, where you at now?]

The trainees excitedly rehashed the dramatic rescue on their way back. The chemistry between Lucy and Ethan sent the livestream’s engagement soaring.

Both teams successfully sold all their goods and even treated themselves to a famous local restaurant. When they checked the bill, they realized they’d only spent half their earnings, so they decided to walk to the market for dinner ingredients.

As soon as they entered, they spotted Daniel Miller and Robert Lee looking miserable beside piles of unsold potatoes and sweet potatoes.

"What are you guys doing here?" Daniel asked in surprise.

Lucy waved her shopping bag. "We already sold everything and had lunch. Now we’re getting dinner supplies."

"What?!" Daniel’s eyes widened. "You sold out and ate out?"

Ethan smirked. "Because we have Lucy. Something you can’t have."

Daniel and Robert groaned. "We’re borrowing Lucy tomorrow!"
Ethan shrugged. "Depends on your luck."

The trainees eagerly recounted the day’s events, leaving Daniel and the others stunned.

"Little Lucy can read fortunes too?" Robert asked skeptically.
Lucy nodded. "Just a little."

"Do me next!" Daniel leaned in.
Lucy grinned and pointed at their unsold goods. "Keep stalling, and you’ll really go hungry tonight."

Daniel wailed, "Help us out here!"
###Chapter 36 The Culinary Prodigy

"Lucy, save us!"

Daniel Miller clutched Lucy White’s sleeve with pleading eyes, his hair disheveled. Behind him, the trainees looked utterly defeated, like wilted greens after a frost.

Robert Lee added miserably, "We haven’t eaten lunch—just two cold buns."

Lucy glanced at the piles of potatoes and sweet potatoes on their stall and frowned. The situation was worse than she’d expected.

"Maybe... we could perform?" one trainee suggested weakly.

"No," Lucy shook her head. "The market crowd isn’t here for entertainment."

Her gaze landed on a nearby stall packing up for the day, and her eyes lit up.

"I’ve got an idea!"

Ten minutes later, the stall reopened. Lucy tied on an apron and demonstrated with swift precision.

"Peel and steam the sweet potatoes, mix with glutinous rice flour, knead into dough..."

The trainees watched intently, mesmerized. Daniel couldn’t resist sneaking a taste of the half-finished mixture—his eyes widened in shock.

"This is amazing!"

As the oil sizzled, golden-brown fritters tumbled out, filling the market with a mouthwatering aroma.

"Freshly fried fritters! Get them while they’re hot!"

The trainees called out eagerly, quickly drawing their first customers.

[Damn, this is genius!]
[Lucy is a goddess—even street food becomes gourmet in her hands.]
[Me, eating instant noodles, crying with envy.]

Business boomed beyond expectations. But Lucy suddenly called a halt. "This isn’t sustainable."

She pointed at the nearly empty oil pot. "We need to expand."

And so, an unbelievable sight unfolded—top-tier celebrity Daniel Miller, holding a paper tray, chased after passersby. "Ma’am, try our fritters!"

[LMAO, Daniel, where’s your idol dignity?]
[Peak entertainment right here.]

By evening, Lucy and her procurement team returned laden with supplies. Ethan Smith naturally took the heaviest bag from her hands.

"What do you want for dinner?" Lucy asked.

Ethan’s gaze softened. "Anything you make."

The trainees cheered, "BBQ!"

"Alright," Lucy agreed with a laugh, oblivious to Lily Green’s dark expression in the corner.

Meanwhile, in the kitchen of a high-end restaurant—

"Why does the fish taste off today?" the head chef demanded.

A server whispered, "It’s from Ms. Green’s supplier..."

The chef’s face paled. "Pull it all—now!"

Unaware, Lily had no idea her "good fortune" was brewing a storm. Back at the farmhouse, the BBQ coals glowed, illuminating Lucy’s radiant smile.


###Chapter 37: Clash of Wills

Lily Green's triumphant smile froze the moment she saw Lucy White and her team return with arms full of supplies. Suppressing the jealousy boiling inside her, she forced a casual tone as she stood up. "Mr. Smith, Ms. White, you've finished selling your items too?"

Ethan Smith didn’t even glance her way, walking straight to the sofa area and pouring himself a glass of water with deliberate elegance.

Lucy took the glass he handed her and replied nonchalantly, "Yeah."

Unwilling to let it go, Lily pressed further, "You bought so many ingredients—you must have earned a lot, right?"

The livestream chat exploded instantly:
[Ethan's ice-cold attitude is legendary]
[Why is Lily so annoying?]

Lucy swirled her glass, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Trade secret."

Lily's smile stiffened, her nails digging into her palms. Desperate to shift the conversation, she asked, "Are you two teams cooking together?"

"Yep." Lucy suddenly seemed amused, tilting her head. "And you're teaming up with Mr. Johnson?"

Lily immediately straightened, pride lacing her voice. "We helped Mr. Johnson sell his items before shopping together." She deliberately emphasized the words, stealing a glance at Lucy’s reaction.

Michael Johnson frowned slightly but stayed silent.

Lucy chuckled. "You two seem close. Old friends?"

Lily’s pulse spiked. The question was a trap—if she claimed familiarity, fans would accuse her of clinging to his fame; if she denied it, it would ruin her plans.

"We met on set," Michael interjected coolly.

Lily quickly added, "Mr. Johnson is very kind to all his co-stars."

Lucy toyed with her glass, feigning indifference. "I thought you'd known each other longer."

A cold sweat trickled down Lily’s back. She sensed the danger but had no choice. "You and Mr. Johnson go way back, don’t you?"

She smirked inwardly—if Lucy denied it, she could later paint her as a liar.

To her shock, Lucy nodded easily. "We grew up together. Our mothers are best friends."

The room erupted in murmurs. The livestream chat went wild:
[Bombshell revelation!]
[So the scandal was just childhood friends fighting?]

Lily paled. Everything was spiraling out of control.

"Is that so?" She forced a smile at Michael. "You never mentioned it before, Mr. Johnson."

Michael, unusually, smiled. "Lucy and I have twenty years of history."

"Pity," Lucy sighed dramatically. "One scandal was all it took to sink twenty years of friendship." Her gaze slid pointedly to Lily. "I still wonder who that mysterious informant was."

Michael’s expression darkened. He opened his mouth but faltered under Lucy’s icy stare.

Lily squirmed, nails biting deeper into her palms. She realized with dread that the trap she’d set was now snapping shut around her.
###Chapter 38: Lily Green's Scheme Falls Apart

Lily Green's hand trembled slightly as she gripped the kitchen knife, its blade scraping harshly against the cutting board.

She never expected Lucy White to publicly cut ties with Michael Johnson during the livestream. It completely ruined her carefully laid plans.

"Lily, should I slice or dice these potatoes?" a fellow contestant asked cautiously.

Lily snapped out of her thoughts and forced a smile. "Just slice them."

She willed herself to stay calm. Richard Brown had assured her that all nearby surveillance footage had been erased. As long as she denied everything, no one could prove she was the woman in those photos.

Laughter drifted in from outside the kitchen. Through the window, Lily saw Lucy chatting and laughing with Ethan Smith.

Thud. The knife slammed down onto the board.

"Lily?" The contestant beside her flinched.

"Sorry, my hand slipped." Lily managed another weak smile, though her mind was in turmoil.

That bitch Lucy had publicly severed ties with Michael in front of millions. Now, Lily's meticulously crafted plan was falling apart.

The livestream chat exploded:

[Holy crap! Lucy and Michael were childhood friends?!]
[Michael’s such a jerk for making his best friend take the blame!]
[My heart breaks for Lucy—she’s been getting hate for so long.]
[So who is the woman in those photos?]

Lily bit her lower lip hard. She couldn’t panic. She just had to endure these next few days...

"Lily, come help with the barbecue!" Daniel Miller called from the yard.

Taking a deep breath, Lily plastered on her sweetest smile and stepped outside.

In the courtyard, Lucy was teaching Ethan how to marinate skewers. They stood close, and when Ethan leaned in to listen, his gaze was so tender it could melt ice.

The sight stung Lily’s eyes.

"Oh, Lily, you're here." Lucy glanced up, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. "Perfect. Want to take over grilling these vegetables?"

Lily accepted the tongs with a strained smile, though she secretly wished she could shove Lucy into the fire.

Meanwhile, social media had erupted.

#LucyAndMichaelChildhoodFriends
#MichaelMadeHisBestFriendTakeTheBlame
#LilyGreenSignedWithRichardBrown

All three hashtags trended at the top.

[Lily signed with Richard Brown already?]
[That’s way too convenient.]
[Is she the woman in those photos?]

Richard scowled at his phone and dialed a number. "Initiate Plan B."

Back at the farmhouse, the aroma of barbecue filled the air.

"Lucy, how did you make this marinade? It’s amazing!" Daniel sidled up to her.

Before Lucy could answer, her phone buzzed. She glanced at the notification, her lips curling slightly.

"What is it?" Ethan murmured.

Lucy showed him her screen. "The show’s about to start."

A breaking news alert flashed: [EXCLUSIVE: Intimate Photos of Lily Green and Michael Johnson on Set Leaked!]

Ethan raised a brow. "Need help?"

"No." Lucy chuckled. "I’ve got this."

She turned toward the grill and called out, "Lily, your phone’s been buzzing nonstop."

Lily’s heart lurched. She fumbled for her phone—and went pale.

The livestream chat went wild:

[Check Twitter! Proof just dropped!]
[It is Lily in those photos!]
[Damn, she’s such a good actress!]

Lily’s hands shook, and a skewer tumbled into the coals, sending up a shower of sparks.

"What’s wrong?" Daniel asked.

"N-Nothing..." Lily stammered.

Then her phone rang—Richard glaring on the screen.

Everyone turned to look.

Lucy tilted her head. "Aren’t you going to answer? Might be important."

Lily clenched her phone so hard her nails dug into her palms. She finally realized: she’d walked right into Lucy’s trap.

And this was only the beginning.
###Chapter 39: The Talisman's Power

As dusk painted the sky in shades of orange, Daniel Miller and the trainees swiftly set up the barbecue grill in the courtyard. Soon, wisps of smoke curled upward, carrying the mouthwatering aroma of roasting meat.

Lucy White had marinated the meat earlier and prepared a special seasoning blend—her secret recipe. Standing to the side, she guided the trainees as they took turns grilling.

The moment the meat hit the sizzling grill, its rich fragrance burst forth.

"Oh my God! This smells incredible!" Daniel couldn't resist sneaking a bite, his eyes lighting up. "This seasoning is amazing!"

Ryan Clark, flipping the meat with pride, grinned. "See, Daniel? My skills are top-notch."

"Dream on!" Daniel rolled his eyes. "It's all Lucy's seasoning doing the work."

The trainees burst into laughter, but Ryan only puffed his chest out. "Exactly! That just proves how amazing our Lucy is!"

Mid-sentence, he quickly snatched another piece and popped it into his mouth. His eyes widened. "Holy—this is unbelievably good!"

"Hey! No stealing!" Jason Wright lunged forward, wrapping an arm around Ryan's neck in mock outrage.

Lucas Young and Noah Adams immediately joined the playful scuffle, turning the courtyard into a lively battleground. Benjamin Harris and Nathan King, carrying plates of freshly grilled meat, dragged Lucy and Ethan Smith into the chaotic food fight.

Laughter echoed through the air, and even the livestream audience couldn't help but feel the infectious joy.

On the other side, Lily Green bit her lip as she watched the lively scene. She tugged at Michael Johnson's sleeve. "Michael, should we—"

"No." His reply was cold, but his gaze involuntarily trailed after Lucy.

Their trainees ate their simple meals in silence, casting envious glances toward the other group. Lily's team, in particular, had been slipping in popularity rankings—something none of them dared to voice.

At eight in the evening, a knock at the gate interrupted the courtyard's cheerful noise.

The Wu couple stood at the entrance, their child in their arms. The moment they spotted Lucy, they bowed deeply. "Miss White, Mr. Smith—thank you so much!"

The director immediately signaled the cameras to focus on the scene. This was prime content for the show.

The little boy's eyes sparkled as he reached out for Lucy. Her heart softened, and she took him into her arms before pulling out a yellow talisman folded into a triangle from her bag.

"This is a protection charm. Keep it with him."

Mrs. Wu accepted it with both hands, handling it as if it were precious. After what had happened earlier that day, she believed in its power without question.

Once the family left, Daniel sidled up to Lucy, curiosity brimming. "Lucy, you can actually make talismans?"

"I know a little," she replied modestly.

"Do they really work?" he asked, half-skeptical.

Lucy explained, "They enhance the wearer's luck and can ward off a single major disaster."

"That’s incredible!" Daniel's eyes widened, and he opened his mouth to ask for one—only for Robert Lee to subtly pull him back.

Noticing this, Lucy turned to Robert. "Mr. Lee, avoid water tomorrow."

Robert blinked, then nodded with a smile. "Got it. I'll remember."

As the night deepened, laughter and chatter filled the courtyard. No one noticed Michael's lingering gaze, fixed on Lucy's slender figure, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 40: The Prophecy Fulfilled

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Lucy White stretched and changed into her workout clothes for a jog.

"Morning," Ethan Smith greeted her, already warming up in the yard.

They jogged side by side along the country path, breathing in the crisp air. Dew dampened their sneakers, but the freshness lifted their spirits.

Back at the house, Lucy tied on an apron and began cooking porridge. The aroma of simmering rice soon filled the kitchen.

"Smells amazing!" The trainees, roused by the scent, gathered around eagerly.

Today’s theme was Rural Getaway, and for once, the production crew had provided steamed buns. Yet everyone still lined up for Lucy’s porridge, helping themselves to bowl after bowl.

"Miss Lucy, this is incredible!" Ryan Clark beamed, cradling his bowl.

After breakfast, the group boarded a bus to the Wu Family Farm. Nestled between mountains and a river, the farm was dotted with free-roaming chickens and ducks, while sheep grazed lazily in the distance.

"Let’s split into teams," Lucy suggested. "We’ll prepare lunch and dinner ourselves."

Wu Hongyi led the male trainees to hunt for chickens and gather eggs, while Lucy took the girls to pick fresh produce. Lily Green lingered nearby, her eyes flickering with calculation.

"Let’s go fishing!" she suddenly suggested, pointing to the pond behind them with a sweet smile. "I heard the fish here are especially plump."

Robert Lee hesitated, recalling Lucy’s warning from the day before. But under Lily’s persistent coaxing, he reluctantly followed.

[OMG, why is Robert going fishing?!]
[Didn’t Lucy tell him to stay away from water?]
[This is so superstitious—what could possibly happen?]

Lily cast her line with practiced ease and soon got a bite. "Robert, come look!" she called excitedly. "I’ve got a big one!"

Robert took the rod and gave it a firm tug. The water erupted as an enormous carp leaped out, sending a spray into the air.

"Watch out!" someone shouted.

But it was too late. The force yanked Robert forward, and he stumbled—then plunged headfirst into the pond. Amid the splashing, his figure quickly sank beneath the surface.

"Help!" Lily paled, frozen in place.

Daniel Miller was the first to dive in, followed by the crew. Two minutes later, they hauled Robert onto the bank, his lips already tinged blue.

Medics immediately began CPR. After tense moments, Robert coughed up water and slowly opened his eyes.

"Lucy…" he rasped weakly, his gaze unfocused.

The director’s expression darkened as he sent someone to fetch Lucy. The other guests exchanged uneasy glances—no one had expected yesterday’s prophecy to come true like this.

Lily stood at the edge of the crowd, wringing her hands. She’d only wanted to show off, never anticipating such a disaster.

"This is all my fault…" she whimpered, though no one paid attention to her act.

In the distance, Lucy walked back with a basket of fresh vegetables, the sunlight casting a long shadow behind her.
###Chapter 41: This Wasn't Supposed to Happen

Robert Lee's plunge into the water sent the livestream into chaos.

[OMG! Lucy predicted this!]
[How did she know? That's insane!]
[Who said Lucy was faking it? Come take your L!]
[Is Robert okay? That looked scary.]

Lily Green stood at the back of the crowd, her nails digging into her palms. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Her lucky charm had never failed her before.

"Lily, are you alright?" Michael Johnson asked with concern.

Lily forced a smile. "I'm fine. I'm just worried about Robert..."

She hurried to the bedside, summoning tears on command. "Robert, this is all my fault..."

Seeing her tear-streaked face, Robert's resentment inexplicably faded. "It's not your fault..."

The door swung open, and Lucy White walked in. Lily's tears froze mid-fall.

"Robert, how are you feeling?" Lucy handed him a glass of water.

Robert took it, his expression conflicted. "Lucy... you were right."

The director wisely ushered the camera crew out of the room.

"I remembered your warning this morning," Robert muttered, running a hand through his hair. "But when Lily called me, I just..."

Lucy nodded in understanding. "It wasn’t your fault."

"About that... talisman..." Robert hesitated.

Lucy pulled one from her bag. "Fifty grand. Friends and family discount."

Robert transferred the money without hesitation. "Worth it."

Lowering his voice, he added, "There's something... off about Lily."

Lucy smiled faintly. "Your luck’s been good lately. Don’t overthink it."

When the door reopened, Robert looked noticeably better.

"Robert, you’re glowing!" the director exclaimed.

Robert patted his breast pocket. "All thanks to Lucy’s talisman."

The livestream exploded:

[Lucy, open a talisman shop!]
[I’d pay a million for one!]
[Did you see Lily’s face just now?]
[Something’s fishy...]

In the corner, Lily stared daggers at Lucy’s back. This wasn’t supposed to happen. She was supposed to be the star.
###Chapter 42: The Trending Storm Returns

"Robert, you don't look so good," the director patted Robert Lee's shoulder, half-joking. "Should we ask Ms. White to take another look at you?"

Robert grinned, lowering his voice mysteriously. "Already did."

"She said I've got good news coming my way soon." He rubbed his hands together, eyes sparkling with excitement.

The director paused before realizing his old friend was helping build Lucy's reputation. He played along with a laugh. "If it comes true, you're treating us!"

"Absolutely!" Robert agreed readily.

"Get some rest then. I'll call you for lunch." The director turned to Lily Green standing nearby. "Lily, you should rest too."

Robert waved her off. "Yeah, Lily, I just need a nap. No need to fuss over me."

Lily's smile stiffened before she nodded. "Rest well, Mr. Lee."

As she left, Lucy's sharp eyes caught a wisp of white mist dissipating from Lily's form. She narrowed her eyes, understanding dawning.

This transmigrated heroine's luck truly fluctuated with her progress. In the past life, Lily had climbed the entertainment industry ladder by maxing out favorability with Robert and others.

Now? Lucy smirked. Trying the same trick again? Not a chance.

Lily stepped out, frustration churning in her chest. Spotting Lucy nearby worsened her irritation.

Why did this woman keep ruining her plans? Lily bit her lip, vowing silently to find a way to kick Lucy off the show.

At lunch, trainees showcased their skills. Those who could cook dazzled before the cameras, their popularity soaring.

The afternoon passed leisurely—some sketched landscapes, others hiked, while a group played cards in the courtyard, savoring the rare countryside tranquility.

The farm owner generously contributed two mini pigs. Hesitant to waste such premium ingredients, everyone begged Lucy to take charge.

Her roast pig emerged crispy outside, tender inside, its aroma irresistible. Rave reviews poured in, live comments exploding with praise.

Only two found no joy in the meal.

Michael Johnson stared at his portion, heart souring. These delicacies used to be his exclusive privilege, now shared with so many.

Lily might as well have been eating sawdust. Each spotlight on Lucy twisted the knife deeper.

On the return bus, everyone still reminisced about the roast.

Next morning at breakfast, Robert's phone rang. Hanging up, he rushed to Lucy, ecstatic.

"Incredible! Ms. White, you're amazing!" He nearly danced. "Director Yan just offered me the lead in his new film!"

Gasps erupted. Director Yan's projects were industry gold—everyone wanted in, yet Robert landed the prize.

Daniel Miller and others gazed at Lucy with newfound awe. Her divination skills were frighteningly accurate.

Lily's stomach dropped. This woman was downright unnatural.

Ethan Smith sipped coffee calmly, long since acquainted with Lucy's talents.

Michael swelled with quiet pride. He'd known Lucy studied metaphysics since childhood, but never realized her mastery.

The director stroked his chin, considering asking for a reading himself.

As preparations for departure began, the internet erupted.

An exposé accused Lucy of betrayal—claiming after cozying up to executive Nathan King, she abandoned agent Richard Brown who'd nurtured her career, switching representation without regard. It listed resources Brown secured for her, condemning her ingratitude.

Propelled by trolls, the爆料 skyrocketed to #1 trending. With the ongoing reality show keeping Lucy's热度 high, the timing was perfect.
###Chapter 43: Sounding the Horn of Counterattack

The car ride back was quiet as Lucy White rested with her eyes closed. The scenery outside the window blurred past, and the sunlight filtering through the glass cast dappled shadows across her face.

"Lucy!" Sophia Taylor suddenly grabbed her arm, her voice trembling with barely contained fury. "They actually did it!"

Lucy slowly opened her eyes, a knowing smile curling at the corners of her lips. "No need to rush. Let them have their fun for now."

Sophia shoved her phone in front of Lucy. "Look at these comments! Richard Brown has no shame!"

On the screen, hired trolls were frantically steering the narrative. Lucy skimmed through them and let out a derisive chuckle.

"The harder they push now, the harder they'll fall later." Her slender fingers tapped lightly against the armrest. "Let them enjoy their moment."

Sophia stomped her foot in frustration. "But they're calling you ungrateful! They're saying you have a sugar daddy! Even that web series your mom recommended—they're crediting it all to Richard!"

Lucy reached out and pinched Sophia's puffed-up cheek. "Relax, sweetheart. Soon enough, they won’t even have tears left to cry."

Her phone buzzed suddenly. Nathan King was calling.

"Nathan," Lucy answered, her voice eerily calm.

"Have you seen what's happening online?" Nathan's voice was laced with concern. "What do you need me to do?"

Lucy chuckled. "Get two things ready for me: a PR team and a legal squad."

As she hung up, Sophia had already pulled up Richard's latest tweet. Beneath the thinly veiled insinuation, fans were viciously attacking Lucy in the comments.

"Hmph." Lucy smirked coldly and opened her own account. "It's time."

Her fingers flew across the screen as she drafted her counterattack. Sophia leaned in, her eyes widening with each passing second.

"Lucy, this is..." She gasped. "Brutal!"

Lucy hit send, then turned to Sophia with a sweet smile. "Now this is what you call a clapback."

Outside the window, the setting sun cast its final golden rays across her delicate profile, painting her skin in a crimson glow.
###Chapter 44: The Shocking Truth

During lunch, the production crew arranged for the guest stars to dine in private rooms while the trainees ate in the main hall.

As Lucy White stepped out of the car, she spotted Ethan Smith approaching from a distance. The sunlight bathed him in a golden glow, making him look almost ethereal.

"Hello, Mr. Smith," she greeted with a bright smile.

Ethan walked closer, his expression tinged with concern. "Have you seen what's happening online?"

Lucy blinked in surprise. She hadn’t expected the usually aloof A-list actor to bring this up.

"Yes, I have," she nodded.

"Do you need help?" His voice was soft but firm.

When Lucy gave him a puzzled look, he lowered his voice. "Thank you for saving me that day—and for the talisman."

Realization dawned on her. So he knew.

"It was nothing, Mr. Smith. Don’t worry about it," she waved it off. "I can handle the online situation."

A flicker of admiration crossed Ethan’s eyes. He’d always sensed there was more to this girl.

"Let’s exchange contacts," he said, pulling out his phone. "Reach out if you ever need anything."

Lucy smiled and scanned his QR code. Just as they finished adding each other, they were spotted by other guests and walked into the restaurant together.

At lunch, Daniel Miller, William Jones, and others took turns reassuring Lucy. They all suspected the online rumors were fabricated.

Only Michael Johnson seemed lost. He never paid attention to trending topics, and seeing the senior artists talking to Lucy one after another only confused him.

Once back in the car, he finally asked his assistant, "What’s going on?"

Hesitantly, the assistant handed him a phone. Michael’s face darkened as he scrolled through the trending hashtags.

"So Richard’s post is basically confirming those rumors?" His voice tightened.

The assistant nodded cautiously. "It seems that way."

Michael opened the comments section, his heart twisting at the flood of hate directed at Lucy.

"I should’ve spoken up last time..." He pressed a hand to his face in frustration. "No wonder she broke up with me."

The assistant sighed. "When we get back to the city, you should talk to her."

After a moment of silence, Michael suddenly dialed a number. "Dig up everything on Richard Brown—starting from when he first managed Lucy."

Two hours later, they arrived in the city. The trainees returned to the training camp while the guest stars dispersed.

Michael wanted to explain things to Lucy, only to learn she had already gone home.

Meanwhile, Lucy sat leisurely in front of her computer. Logging into a hidden account, she compiled her evidence and sent it to a well-known whistleblower blogger, Entertainment Watchdog.

An hour later, the influential influencer Charlie Zhou dropped a bombshell:

[The Truth Behind the "Lucy White Betrayal" Scandal]

Accompanied by a nine-image thread of irrefutable proof, each piece exposing Richard Brown’s lies. Soon after, a renowned screenwriter also voiced support for Lucy.

Netizens erupted:

[Holy crap! So all those opportunities were earned by Lucy herself!]

[Richard is disgusting—taking credit for company resources]

[Look at these chat logs! He’s been colluding with Lily Green all along!]

[The worst part? He tried to force her into that BL drama lead—pure sabotage!]

[Confirmed! That smear post was paid for by Richard!]

The hashtag #RichardBrownExposed instantly topped the charts.

Netizens joked: [Now this is a juicy scandal!]
###Chapter 45: Internet Eruption

Charlie Zhou's Weibo post detonated like a depth charge, instantly igniting the entire internet.

Nine-grid photos, bank transfer records, and chat screenshots—the evidence was irrefutable.

Award-winning screenwriter Ethan Smith personally reposted with a comment: "Lucy White is the most dedicated actress I've ever worked with. Some people should know their limits."

The comment section exploded.

"Holy crap! Richard Brown is next-level shameless. Three years with Lucy, and this is how he treats her?"

"Sisters, check the third photo! Richard and Lily Green were secretly meeting at a hotel last year!"

"Ugh! So they've been sneaking around all this time, pretending to be mentor and protégé?"

"Lucy got played hard—milked for three years and then framed."

"Richard Brown, get out of the entertainment industry!"

The top three trending hashtags were dominated:
#RichardBrownScum
#SorryLucyWhite
#LilyGreenHomewrecker

Richard's hands trembled as he gripped his phone.

He had deleted all this evidence—how did it resurface?

The worst was the hotel photo, timestamped on Lucy's birthday.

Ding. A notification chimed—his special alert.

Lily messaged him: "What do we do? My fans are demanding answers about the photo."

Sweat beaded on Richard's forehead. If Michael Johnson found out...

His phone vibrated violently. The caller ID flashed: "Mr. Johnson."

His fingers slipped, and the phone clattered to the floor.

Meanwhile, at a Michelin three-star restaurant...

Lily bit her straw, eyes glistening. "Liam... I'm so scared..."

Liam Parker seized her wrist. "Don’t worry. I’ll have the hashtag buried."

He dialed a number. "Suppress #LilyGreenHomewrecker. Now."

A pause. "What do you mean you can’t?"

Lily's tears splattered onto the napkin.

Liam's expression darkened. "Find out who this Charlie Zhou really is."

The newly served steak sizzled on the plate—a perfect mirror to the internet’s raging fury.

Richard shakily picked up his phone. Twenty-three missed calls.

A new notification popped up:
"Mr. Johnson: Conference room. 9 AM tomorrow."

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, neon lights painted the city. For the first time, Richard wondered if this would be his last night seeing them.
###Chapter 46: This Is Just the Beginning

Lily Green tilted her face upward, her eyes glistening with touched tears.

"Liam, you're so good to me," she murmured in a sweet, coquettish voice.

Liam Parker gently stroked her long hair. "For you, anything is worth it."

Lily bit her lower lip, feigning hesitation. "But Lucy White now has that top-tier agent backing her..."

"Don't worry," Liam cut her off. "I have connections with David Wilson from Stellar Entertainment. He’ll handle this small matter."

At the mention of David Wilson’s name, Lily’s heart raced. He was a true powerhouse in the entertainment industry!

She nestled deeper into Liam’s embrace, tracing idle circles on his chest with her fingertip. "You’re so good to me. I don’t know how to repay you."

Liam’s gaze darkened, and without another word, he swept her into his arms.

Giggling, Lily wrapped her arms around his neck as they tumbled onto the sofa.

Outside the window, a tiny drone silently recorded everything.

Meanwhile, at the top floor of the Smith Corporation.

"Young Master, the Parkers have made their move," the assistant reported respectfully.

Ethan Smith tapped the desk with his slender fingers. "Find out why."

"It’s Lily Green," the assistant handed over the documents. "She’s… quite close with Liam Parker."

Ethan smirked. "How resourceful."

"Should we intervene?"

"No need." A glint of amusement flashed in Ethan’s eyes. "Let’s see how much longer she can keep this up."

As soon as the assistant left the office, his phone buzzed.

"What? The hashtag is trending again?" He looked at Ethan in surprise. "Sir, someone acted faster than us."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"A top-tier hacker," the assistant lowered his voice. "Even the Parkers couldn’t suppress it."

Ethan’s lips curved thoughtfully. "Interesting."

Elsewhere, Liam Parker hurled his phone across the room in fury.

"Useless! Can’t even take down a damn hashtag!"

When Lily heard the news, her nails dug into her palms. Refusing to give up, she continued paying trolls to smear Lucy’s name.

Then, out of nowhere, a hacker under the alias "Justice Bringer" appeared.

Every account that had insulted Lucy was exposed—real names, occupations, even past misdeeds laid bare.

The internet erupted in shock.

"Oh my god! The one who cursed the most is actually a schoolteacher!"
"This troll scammed an elderly couple last year!"
"This is terrifying—I’ll never comment recklessly again..."

Lily’s face turned deathly pale, her hands trembling uncontrollably.

For the first time, she felt real fear—just who was standing behind Lucy?

In her apartment, Lucy closed her laptop and stretched lazily.

"The show… has only just begun."

The next morning, Sophia Taylor arrived to take Lucy to the training camp.

"Lucy, last night was so satisfying!" Sophia exclaimed excitedly. "Richard Brown is finished!"

Lucy chuckled. "Don’t rush. That was just the first course."

"And Lily’s dirt…?"

"Wait a little longer." A sly glint flashed in Lucy’s eyes. "The best performances unfold slowly."

Sophia grinned in understanding. "Got it."

When Lucy walked into the training camp, the livestream cameras immediately focused on her.

Dressed in striking red, she looked radiant—a far cry from her rustic farm-stay persona.

"Good morning, Miss Lucy!" The five trainees greeted her in unison, admiration shining in their eyes.

Lucy nodded gracefully, her red lips curving into a smile. "Ready? Today’s lesson will be… unforgettable."
###Chapter 47: Heavenly Voice Stuns the Audience

Lucy White walked into the practice room with light steps, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"How's everyone's preparation going?" She pulled out a chair and sat down, her gaze sweeping gently over the five young men.

Benjamin Harris, the team leader, answered promptly, "Ms. White, we already have a preliminary concept."

Jason Wright added, "I'm handling the composition, Lucas Young and I are working on the lyrics, and the others are choreographing the dance."

Lucy nodded in approval. "Good. Let's get started, then."

Jason hesitated for a moment before speaking up. "Ms. White, the production crew requested that the guest also participate in the performance. What style of singing or dancing are you comfortable with?"

The practice room fell silent. The five boys stared at her nervously.

[Oh no, I heard Lucy can't sing at all!]
[Just a pretty face with no talent.]
[Feel bad for our boys—they're gonna be dragged down.]

Lucy saw right through their worries and chuckled softly. "I can adapt to anything. This is your stage—just go with what you're best at."

Jason exhaled in relief. "This round's theme is 'Rural Getaway.' We were thinking of a lighthearted, cheerful approach."

"A wise choice," Lucy praised. "Sticking to the theme will earn you higher scores."

Lucas mustered his courage. "Ms. White, could you try singing a few lines? It’ll help us assign parts."

"Of course." Lucy agreed readily.

The moment the first note left her lips, the entire practice room went still.

Her ethereal, crystal-clear voice flowed like a mountain spring, every modulation executed with breathtaking precision. The five boys gaped in awe, while the livestream's live comments exploded.

[Holy—that’s a heavenly voice!]
[Who said Lucy can’t sing? Come out and take the L!]
[This skill puts so many professional singers to shame!]

As the last note faded, Jason nearly jumped in excitement. "Ms. White, you’re amazing!"

"I was just singing casually." Lucy waved it off modestly. "Keep working on your creation—I’ll just observe from here."

For the rest of the session, Lucy sat quietly in the corner, only offering soft suggestions when the trainees hit a creative block.

[Lucy is so gentle and supportive.]
[Now this is what a real mentor looks like.]
[Can the other mentor take notes? All she does is hog the spotlight.]

"Try softening the transition here." Lucy walked to the piano and demonstrated. "Like this..."

Jason’s eyes lit up with realization. "That makes so much sense!"

As the sun set, the practice room’s glass windows reflected the six figures immersed in their work. None of them noticed the livestream’s viewer count skyrocketing.
###Chapter 48: The Crumbling Persona

With a soft click, Lucy White pushed open the practice room door.

Five trainees sat in a circle on the floor, discussing the song arrangement. They immediately stood up to greet her. Lucy waved them off, signaling for them to continue.

"I think the chorus could use a stronger rhythm," she said, crouching down and tapping the sheet music. "But the final decision is yours."

Next door, Lily Green’s shrill voice cut through the air: "This move is so outdated! Do it again!"

Through the glass wall, Lily stood with her hands on her hips in front of the mirror, while five male trainees repeated the dance moves, sweat dripping down their faces.

[OMG, what’s Lily freaking out about now?]
[Does she think she’s the head trainer or something?]
[Compared to Lucy’s group, this looks like boot camp.]

The atmosphere in Lucy’s practice room was relaxed. She sat cross-legged on the floor, listening intently to the trainees’ ideas.

"That vocal run was excellent," she said, her eyes lighting up. "What if we layered the harmonies a bit more?"

The live comments exploded:
[Now THAT’S professionalism!]
[This is what real mentorship looks like.]
[Someone next door needs to take notes.]

Suddenly, Lily barged in. "You should add a rap section," she declared, grabbing a pen and scribbling on the sheet music without asking. "It’ll make the performance pop."

The air turned icy.

"Thanks for the suggestion," Lucy said calmly, pulling the sheet music back. "But this is their work."

Lily’s face stiffened. The comments went wild:
[Who does she think she is, hijacking another team’s song?]
[Acting like she’s some all-rounder superstar.]
[The contrast is brutal.]

Three days later, during the rehearsal for the live performance, the production crew deliberately scheduled both groups to practice on the same stage.

Lily’s team’s performance was a chaotic mess, with the forced rap section clashing against the rest of the song. Meanwhile, Lucy’s group moved seamlessly, the five trainees executing every move in perfect sync.

The director shook his head as he watched the monitor. "This comparison is..."

"Director!" An assistant rushed over. "Mr. Parker from Parker Group is demanding to see you."

Meanwhile, at an upscale restaurant—

"David, just do me this favor," Liam Parker swirled his wine glass. "It’s just a small-time celebrity. Have her blacklisted."

David Wilson set down his fork. The metal clinked sharply against the porcelain.

"Liam," he said, his gaze sharp. "The whole internet has seen how your girlfriend is performing on that show."

Liam’s expression darkened. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

"It means," David stood, straightening his cuffs with deliberate slowness, "Lily Green’s persona is crumbling."

As he walked away, the sound of shattering glass echoed behind him.

Backstage, Lily whined into her phone: "Liam, Lucy’s bullying me again..."

She didn’t know a passing trainee had accidentally recorded the entire conversation.

With 24 hours left until the live performance, the recording began circulating online.
###Chapter 49: Stage Rivalry

"Five, four, three, two, one—livestream starts!"

As the director's countdown ended, forty trainees stood in perfect formation on stage. The dazzling lights swept over their tense yet eager faces.

"Today's rules are simple," the host announced, holding up a cue card. "Eight teams will compete simultaneously. Professional judges' scores account for 50%, while audience votes make up the other 50%."

Jason Wright leaned toward Lucy White and whispered, "Ms. White, you've got the best luck. We're counting on you for the draw later."

Lucy, sporting a high ponytail, a white cropped tee, and denim shorts, radiated youthful energy. She flashed an OK sign. "Got it."

The draw began. Lucy’s fingers lightly tapped the box before pulling out ball number five—a mid-range slot that spared them the pressure of opening while keeping the audience engaged.

"Ugh, my terrible luck," William Jones sighed, revealing ball number one. Robert Lee followed suit. "What a coincidence—I got the closing act."

The first performance kicked off swiftly. Six trainees moved in perfect sync to a gentle melody, but renowned choreographer Lin Yue frowned from the judges' table. "Too soft. They lack explosive energy."

The second group delivered a steady performance, but the third had an unfortunate mishap—a cracked high note threw off the entire routine, sparking murmurs in the audience.

"Next up—Team Lily Green!"

Under the spotlight, Lily stunned in a silver sequin mini dress. Her opening high note drew gasps, but vocal coach Zhao Ke narrowed his eyes. "Unstable breath control."

During the dance segment, Lily stood out like a proud swan among her five backup dancers, prompting debate among the judges. "Is this a group performance or a solo act?"

[Live comments exploded]
"Lily slayed!"
"But the others got completely overshadowed..."
"The judges are brutal today!"

Lily’s team temporarily took first place, though not without controversy.

"Our turn," Lucy patted Jason’s shoulder. As the music started, five young men burst onto the stage with electrifying energy. The moment Lucy’s crystalline voice joined in, the performance soared to another level.

She had tweaked her singing style—delivering the cherry-themed verse with a crisp, honeyed tone. Her high notes during the climax were ethereal, a stark contrast to Lily’s earlier performance.

[Live comments went wild]
"That voice is pure magic!"
"Everyone shines here!"
"Now THIS is teamwork!"

All three judges awarded high scores. Even those inclined to nitpick hesitated under the audience’s watchful eyes.

"Current first place—Team Lucy White!"

Next up was Michael Johnson’s group. The top-tier star’s entrance alone triggered deafening screams, but sharp-eyed viewers noticed he deliberately toned down his presence to spotlight his teammates.

"Energetic, but off-theme," the producer remarked. They settled for second place.

The penultimate act belonged to Ethan Smith. When the tall figure took center stage, even Lucy straightened in her seat. Dressed in a silk white shirt with the top buttons undone, his voice—amplified by the mic—sent shivers down spines with every syllable.

"I’m deceased!"
"Did this man swallow a CD?!"
The live comments flooded the screen.

Ethan sang only a few lines, yet every glance from him was heart-stopping. His team narrowly overtook Lucy’s, claiming the top spot.

The final group’s lackluster performance all but sealed their last-place fate.

The host grinned mysteriously. "Now, the most intense moment—voting! Who will advance? Find out after the break!"

Just before the screen cut to black, the cameras caught Lucy and Ethan exchanging a fleeting smile across the stage.

[Live comments]
"I SHIP THEM!"
"Don’t leave us hanging!"
"The producers love their cliffhangers!"
###Chapter 50: Ethan Smith's Unusual Behavior

The stage lights dimmed as the performances of all eight groups concluded.

At the judges' table, the mentors were busy tallying the final scores.

"In first place—Ethan Smith's team!" the host announced loudly. "Second place goes to Lucy White's team! Third place, Michael Johnson's team!"

Lily Green stood at the edge of the stage, her fingers unconsciously twisting the fabric of her skirt. She had performed flawlessly—why was she only ranked fourth?

The livestream voting session began under the supervision of official auditors.

As the numbers on the screen rapidly changed, Lily's smile slowly froze.

"Team ranking sixth—Lily Green's team!"

Her head snapped up, disbelief flashing in her eyes as she stared at the screen. How was this possible?

The individual rankings were even more devastating. Every member of Lucy's team had risen significantly, while one of Lily's trainees had been eliminated.

"Judge!" The eliminated trainee suddenly stepped forward. "Our mentor Lily performed so well, why—"

"Because she overshadowed all of you," a female judge cut in bluntly. "The entire performance looked like a backup dance for her. There was no spotlight left for the trainees."

Lily's eyes reddened instantly. These judges must have been bribed by Lucy!

Backstage, Lucy watched the wisp of dissipating luck above Lily's head and smirked.

In her past life, that same trainee had been blindly devoted to Lily. Now, he resented her. Interesting.

"Lucy!" Jason Wright and his four teammates surrounded her. "Can we still be on your team next round?"

Lucy shook her head with a smile. "That depends on the production crew."

"If we get to choose, we’d pick you again!" Noah Adams said eagerly, his eyes shining.

After removing her makeup, Lucy stepped out of the dressing room—only to run into Ethan standing across the hallway.

"Ethan," she greeted politely.

He moved beside her naturally. "Walk together?"

Inside the elevator, the man suddenly leaned in, his warm breath brushing her ear. "Be careful of Liam Parker."

Lucy's pulse jumped. Since when did this aloof award-winning actor start paying attention to such things?

In the parking lot, Michael Johnson strode toward them from his car. "Lucy, we need to talk."

His gaze turned icy the moment it landed on Ethan. Since when had this notoriously solitary actor gotten so close to Lucy?
###Chapter 51: Fading Memories

Lucy White didn’t expect to run into Michael Johnson in the parking lot.

She frowned slightly, her tone distant. "What do you want?"

Michael’s chest tightened at her cold expression. How had things between them come to this?

His gaze flickered to Ethan Smith standing beside Lucy, hostility flashing in his eyes. The award-winning actor always gave him an inexplicable sense of unease.

Ethan, hands in his pockets, met his stare with a lazy smirk, a glint of ice in his eyes.

"My mom’s back," Michael said, voice strained as he looked away. "She wants to see you."

Lucy froze. Mrs. Johnson had treated her like a daughter—she couldn’t ignore that bond.

"Fine," she agreed. "Give her my regards."

Michael brightened. "Let me drive you?"

"No need." She turned toward her van, but just as she closed the door, a lean hand stopped it.

Michael pushed his way inside without hesitation. "Then I’ll ride with you."

Lucy scowled. "Get out."

"No." He stubbornly settled beside her, just like when he used to pester her as a child. "I have something to say."

A memory flickered through her mind, and she turned away. The past was still vivid—she didn’t hate him, but she refused to be entangled again.

"Drive," she told the chauffeur.

Silence filled the car. Michael studied her profile, his throat bobbing. "About the trending scandal… I’m sorry."

"Don’t bother." She closed her eyes. "It’s over."

Three simple words, sharp as a blade. His fists clenched. "Can we… really never go back?"

"No." She didn’t open her eyes.

His chest ached. He knew her too well—this was final.

Suddenly, the driver slammed the brakes.

"What’s wrong?" Lucy’s eyes snapped open.

Outside, seven or eight burly men surrounded the vehicle. The leader rapped on the window with a leering grin. "Miss White, someone wants to invite you for tea."

The driver trembled. "T-This is illegal!"

"Illegal?" The man sneered. "We are the law!"

Lucy smirked. She knew this scene too well—Liam Parker had pulled the same stunt in her past life to defend Lily Green.

"Invite me?" She rolled down the window, her gaze glacial. "With what authority?"

The men’s eyes gleamed with greed as they took in her beauty. "Feisty little thing. Let’s see how tough you are later."

Michael’s expression darkened, but Lucy stopped him before he could step out.

"Don’t dirty your hands," she murmured, her fingers twitching as dark energy gathered unseen around them.

The thug remained oblivious, still taunting. "Come quietly, or this’ll get ugly."

Lucy’s lips curved. "You’re dead."
###Chapter 52: Truth and Choice

The night was ink-black as Michael Johnson's fist connected with the thug's face, the impact dull and heavy.

"Looking to die?" His eyes burned with fury, his movements sharp and precise. Raised in a military compound, combat skills were second nature to him.

The thug crumpled to the ground. Seeing this, the others immediately closed in. Lucy White leaned against the car door, her fingers lightly tapping as tendrils of dark energy silently coiled around their ankles.

"Ah!" One of them suddenly screamed, as if seeing something terrifying, and swung at his own companion.

Michael froze for a split second before snapping back to reality. He turned to Lucy, only to find her calmly recording the chaos on her phone.

"Freeze!" The wail of police sirens grew louder. The lead officer frowned at the sight of the writhing thugs on the ground.

Lucy handed over the recorded video and audio to the police. "They tried to kidnap me."

In the interrogation room, the thug trembled. "I-It was Liam Parker who sent us..."

"Liam Parker?" Michael's expression darkened.

Back in the car, Michael couldn't hold back his question. "Do you have history with Liam?"

"I don’t know him," Lucy said, idly spinning her phone. "But I know Lily Green."

"What do you mean?" His grip on the steering wheel tightened.

Lucy smirked. "Did your 'savior' never tell you? She and Liam are quite close."

"Impossible!" Michael reflexively denied. "Lily would never—"

"Would never what?" Lucy cut him off. "Remember the sulfuric acid incident?"

Michael stiffened.

"Did it never occur to you why she just happened to be there? Why she was wearing such thick clothing? Why the acid only splashed on her coat?" With each question, his face grew paler.

"Do some digging," Lucy said, turning to the window. "See what kind of person your precious 'first love' really is."

The car sped through the night, but Michael's mind drifted back to that rainy day—Lily throwing herself in front of him, her pale face, and that unusually heavy coat.

A terrible suspicion took root in his heart.

If this was all a calculated scheme...

What choice would he make?
###Chapter 53: That Bastard Doesn't Deserve You

Michael Johnson stood frozen as Lucy White's words struck him like lightning.

The memory of Lily Green's calculated lunge flashed through his mind—the thick coat, the perfectly angled fall. Every detail now seemed painfully staged.

"So..." His voice trembled. "That life-saving moment was all a lie?"

Lucy didn't answer, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the car window.

When the car stopped in front of the Johnson family villa, Michael remained dazed. Only when Lucy pushed the door open did he snap back to reality.

"Let me walk you in," he blurted.

"No need." She stepped out without looking back.

Rachel Johnson had been waiting in the living room. The moment she spotted Lucy, her face lit up.

"Lucy!" She rushed forward, pulling her into a quick spin. "You've lost weight! Has that idiot not been taking care of you?"

Lucy's eyes stung. "Aunt Rachel, I missed you."

Arm in arm, they headed toward the kitchen, leaving Michael standing forgotten in the hallway.

"I made your favorite black sesame filling," Rachel whispered conspiratorially. "And added that osmanthus honey you loved as a child."

Lucy's throat tightened. After all these years, Rachel still remembered every little thing she adored.

"Aunt Rachel," she said suddenly, "Michael and I broke up."

The dough in Rachel's hands dropped onto the counter with a soft thud.

"When?" Her voice sharpened. "Did he hurt you?"

Lucy recounted the anniversary incident calmly. When she mentioned the trending scandal, Rachel trembled with rage.

"That ungrateful brat!" She slammed her palm on the counter. "I'll break his legs right now!"

"Aunt Rachel." Lucy caught her arm. "My decision is final."

Rachel studied Lucy's face for a long moment before her eyes welled up.

"That boy doesn’t deserve you," she choked out, pulling Lucy into a fierce hug. "From now on, you're my daughter."

Lucy buried her face in Rachel's shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of gardenias—like stepping back into childhood.

"Oh!" Rachel suddenly brightened. "Your mother called saying she's coming to visit?"

Lucy nodded. "She and Noah have already moved in with me."

"Perfect!" Rachel wiped her tears, beaming. "I'll take her shopping tomorrow. She must've been lonely raising Noah alone all these years."

Outside the kitchen, Michael leaned against the wall, the water in his glass long gone cold. The laughter inside pressed down on his chest like a boulder.

So this was what it felt like to lose someone.
###Chapter 54: The Metaphysics Expert

The spoon clinked against the porcelain bowl with a crisp sound.

Lucy White stepped out of the kitchen carrying a bowl of freshly cooked sweet dumplings, followed closely by Michael Johnson. In the living room, Edward Johnson was enthusiastically massaging Rachel Johnson’s shoulders.

"Lucy’s here!" Edward’s eyes lit up as he hurried over.

"Hello, Mr. Johnson," Lucy greeted politely with a nod.

Edward leaned closer to Rachel, dramatically sniffing the air. "My wife’s cooking is on another level. Just the smell of these dumplings is making me drool."

Rachel rolled her eyes. "Even a dog wouldn’t sniff as eagerly as you."

"I’m just complimenting you," Edward said with a pout, rubbing his nose before glaring at his son, who was standing stiffly nearby. "What are you waiting for? Pull out a chair for your girl!"

Lucy: "..."

She noted that this so-called business tycoon’s personality was crumbling by the day.

Michael immediately stepped forward, gently pulling out a chair for her. With the elders present, Lucy couldn’t refuse outright, but once seated, she spoke up. "Mr. Johnson, Michael and I have already broken up."

"What?" Edward’s spoon clattered onto the table. "Since when? Is this some kind of joke?"

"We broke up not long ago, and it’s final," Lucy replied calmly.

Michael clenched his fists. "I don’t agree."

"A breakup isn’t a divorce. Your signature isn’t required," Lucy said without looking up.

Michael’s chest tightened. She was always like this—warm enough to melt ice, yet ruthless as a blade when she made up her mind.

Edward looked stunned. "Lucy, are you really sure about this?"

"Yes." Lucy scooped up a dumpling and blew on it lightly.

Edward turned to his son, eyes sharp. "Did you do something to hurt Lucy?"

Normally, Michael would’ve snapped back. But now, he just lowered his head. "It’s my fault. I upset her."

"Then apologize properly!" Edward said, exasperated.

"I already did. She won’t forgive me." Michael’s voice was muffled.

Just as Edward was about to argue further, a sharp pain shot through his side. Rachel had pinched him hard, her eyes flashing a warning.

"Ahem," Edward wisely changed the subject. "By the way, why did you suddenly ask about the Parker family?"

Michael recounted the evening’s events in detail.

Bang! Rachel slammed her hand on the table. "Liam Parker has some nerve! Does he think Lucy is easy to bully?"

She turned to her husband. "Go teach the Parkers a lesson."

"Aunt Rachel," Lucy set down her chopsticks, "I’d like to handle this myself."

Rachel frowned. "How can you deal with them alone?"

"I have a plan." A glint of determination flashed in Lucy’s eyes. "But I wanted to ask, Mr. Johnson—does the Parker family have any sworn enemies?"

Edward thought for a moment. "The Wu family has been their biggest rival. But lately, the Wus are barely holding on. They probably can’t help."

"Oh?" Lucy’s interest was piqued. "What happened?"

"Strange incidents, one after another." Edward lowered his voice. "The Wu heirs keep meeting with accidents—all seemingly coincidental. They’ve consulted metaphysics experts, but nothing’s worked."

Lucy’s eyes gleamed. "Could you introduce me? I’d like to take a look."

"You?" Edward’s eyes widened. "Are you sure?"

Lucy smiled faintly. "My skills aren’t any worse than my father’s."

Outside, a dark cloud drifted across the moon, shrouding its light.
###Chapter 55: Bitter Regrets

"So that's how it is!"

After a moment's contemplation, Edward Johnson readily agreed, "Alright, I'll contact the Wu family tomorrow and let you know as soon as I hear back."

Normally, he wouldn’t bother with such matters, but Lucy was different. He’d watched her grow up and genuinely adored her.

If he could help the Wu family resolve their issue, great. Even if not, with his backing, they wouldn’t dare make things difficult for her.

"Thank you, Uncle Edward," Lucy said with a bright smile.

Edward waved her off. "No need for formalities with me."

Such a perfect daughter-in-law—how had his foolish son managed to lose her? The more he thought about it, the angrier he got!

After finishing the sweet dumplings, Lucy stood to leave.

Edward quickly offered, "Let Michael see you out."

"No need, the driver’s waiting outside," Lucy politely declined.

Edward could only remind her, "Be careful on the road."

Rachel Johnson personally escorted her to the door and watched the car drive away before returning inside.

The moment she stepped back in, she pulled out her phone, scrolling through recent entertainment news before calling Sophia Taylor.

Sophia reported everything in detail—neither exaggerating nor omitting a single fact.

By the time Rachel hung up, her face was stormy.

Seeing her expression, Edward hurried over. "Honey, who upset you?"

"Who else? Your son’s latest masterpiece!" Rachel shot him a glare.

Edward frowned. "What’s that boy done now?"

Rachel relayed everything she’d learned.

"Before I left, I told him to take care of Lucy. And what does he do? Lets her get dragged through the mud online for some other woman!" Her voice grew sharper with each word.

Edward was stunned. "You bullied Lucy for another woman? And you were two-timing?"

Michael, already in a foul mood, retorted coldly, "I wasn’t. Unlike some people who still carry a torch for their first love."

Edward choked. "..."

"Don’t talk nonsense! Your mother is my first love—it was all a misunderstanding!" he hastily defended.

Rachel scoffed. "You two are cut from the same cloth!"

"Michael, Lucy treated you so well, and you let her suffer for some scheming woman? Serves you right she dumped you!"

"I’ve already talked to Lucy. If you two don’t reconcile within a year, I’m making her my goddaughter."

Michael’s face darkened instantly. "No."

If they became siblings, any chance of reconciliation would vanish.

Rachel smirked. "Not your call. You threw her away—now live with it. That Lily Green will never set foot in this house. Keep your bad taste to yourself!"

Ever since entering the entertainment industry, her son had become increasingly rebellious. No wonder Lucy had grown disillusioned.

Michael’s eyes reddened. "I’ll win her back."

"Empty words mean nothing," Rachel shot back mercilessly.

Seeing his son’s distress, Edward softened. "Honey, he knows he messed up. Don’t be too hard on him."

Rachel glared. "You’re no better. Sleep in the guest room tonight!"

With that, she stormed upstairs.

Edward: "..." What had he done to deserve this?

"Think carefully about what you’ve done," he muttered before rushing after his wife to placate her.

Frustrated, Michael made a call, demanding the surveillance footage from the building.

That night, he received all the clips from Lily’s day.

The more he watched, the grimmer his expression became.

The hallway camera showed Lily tailing the two anti-fans after leaving the restroom, even sending her assistant to deliver a thick coat.

Disguised among the crowd, her gaze never left the duo.

When the anti-fans pulled out the sulfuric acid, she "heroically" intervened—positioned perfectly so most of the liquid splashed harmlessly on the ground.

On closer inspection, she’d not only worn the coat but also a scarf, hat, and mask—completely shielded.

Amid the chaos, he’d been too focused on getting her medical attention to notice these details.

Now the truth was clear: Lily’s "selfless act" had been a meticulously staged performance.

He felt like an idiot for never questioning it.

What was worse, afterward, he’d acted like he was under a spell—granting Lily every request, securing her resources, treating her better than he ever had Lucy.

He had considered asking Lucy to leave the industry, but looking back now, the thought was utterly absurd.

For a scheming woman, he’d lost the girl he’d cherished for twenty years. The regret cut deep.

Meanwhile, back home, Lucy called Sophia.

Hearing Lily had landed the lead in a period drama, Lucy asked for the title—recognizing it as the breakout hit from her past life.

The original lead had skyrocketed to fame because of it, but now Lily had snatched the role.

The protagonist’s halo was indeed formidable—even after failing in variety shows, she’d found another path.

In her past life, the original lead had her luck stolen by Lily, betrayed by her boyfriend, robbed of opportunities, and ultimately forced out of the industry.

Lucy refused to let an innocent person suffer. It was time to strike first.

Spotting an interview where Lily claimed her relationship with Michael was "purely platonic," Lucy smirked and used her hacker alter-ego to send Charlie Zhou some... enlightening material.
###Chapter 56: Lily Green's Swift Retribution

The morning sun had barely touched the windowsill when Twitter's servers crashed.

Charlie Zhou's latest tweet dropped like a depth charge, detonating across the internet.

"The truth you've been waiting for."

Five simple words, accompanied by crystal-clear photos of Lily Green entering a police station and an intimate video of her walking side by side with Michael Johnson.

Lucy White smirked as she scrolled through her phone. If Liam Parker wanted to play dirty, she’d strike first.

Lily loved playing the innocent victim? Fine. Now the whole world would see her for what she really was.

[Holy crap! It was Lily all along!]
[The karma hit faster than a tornado!]
[She was acting all pure in interviews yesterday—what a joke!]

The comments section exploded. Netizens, electrified, flooded the post with shares and debates.

Lucy leisurely skimmed the reactions, tapping her screen. She’d expected nothing less.

Lily’s biggest mistake? Thinking she could mess with Lucy while drowning in her own scandals.

[Michael picking her up at midnight? Yeah, that’s not just friendship.]
[Poor Lucy, taking the blame for so long.]
[Lily the Fake Saint strikes again.]

Three hashtags rocketed to the top of trending:
#LilyPoliceScandal
#MichaelJohnsonRomanceExposed
#LucyWhiteFramed

Michael’s fans lost their minds.

[She’s not worthy of him!]
[If he’s really dating her, I’m done being a fan!]
[At least Lucy’s actually pretty.]

Lily’s Twitter was overrun. Hate poured in by the thousands with every refresh.

"How did this happen…?" Lily’s hands trembled, tears splattering onto her phone screen.

She frantically dialed Richard Brown. "Richard, how did those photos—"

"Stay calm," Richard growled. "This is Lucy’s doing."

"What do I do now?" Her voice cracked. "My new drama—"

Richard paused. "Only one way out. Get Michael to publicly confirm your relationship."

"But—" Her pulse spiked.

"Once he does, we spin it—paint Lucy as the other woman." His laugh was icy. "Public opinion will flip fast."

Lily clenched her phone, a vicious glint in her eyes.

If Lucy wanted war, she’d get one.

She dialed a familiar number…

Meanwhile, Lucy sipped her coffee, unfazed—until her phone buzzed.

An unknown number flashed on the screen:
[Think this is over? The real show’s just starting.]

Lucy arched a brow and set her cup down.

Someone still hadn’t learned their lesson.
###Chapter 57: The Truth Revealed

Lily Green's hand trembled as she clutched her phone, her fingertips turning white.

"This can't be..." she muttered to herself, her flawless makeup unable to mask the panic in her eyes.

Richard Brown's voice came through the phone. "Lily, what's wrong?"

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to sound calm. "Michael Johnson... he rejected my request."

"What?" Richard's voice sharpened. "How could he refuse?"

Lily bit her lower lip, a shadow of resentment flashing in her eyes. "He said... I deliberately stepped in front of that acid on purpose."

Dead silence filled the other end of the line.

After a long pause, Richard lowered his voice. "How does he know?"

"How should I know?" Lily tugged at her hair in frustration, her carefully styled curls now disheveled. "The way he spoke just now... it was like he was a completely different person."

Suddenly, a thought struck her, and she shot to her feet. "Could that bitch Lucy White have said something to him?"

Richard considered it. "Impossible. Lucy hates him now—why would she reach out?"

Lily paced the room, her high heels clicking rapidly against the floor.

"No, I need to confront him in person." She stopped abruptly, a ruthless glint in her eyes. "He can't just cut me off like this."

Richard quickly intervened. "Lily, don't act impulsively. If he's already suspicious, going to him now will only backfire."

Lily scoffed. "Then what do you suggest? After all the effort I put into getting close to him, everything's ruined!"

"Don't panic," Richard said quietly. "First, we need to find out exactly how much he knows. If Lucy is behind this, we have plenty of ways to deal with her."

A calculating look crossed Lily's face. "Right... Lucy. If we just get rid of her..."

She picked up her compact mirror, studying her twisted expression before slowly smoothing her features back into a sweet, charming smile.

"You're right, Richard. We'll stay quiet for now and wait until we know more."

After hanging up, Lily immediately dialed another number.

"Hello, it's me," she cooed, her voice sickly sweet. "Liam, darling... I missed you."

Meanwhile, Michael Johnson stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing down at the city lights.

His phone screen lit up with a message from his assistant: "Mr. Johnson, as instructed, we've cut off all funding for projects involving Ms. Green."

A cold smirk curled Michael's lips.

He turned and walked to his desk, pulling out a stack of photos from the drawer—all evidence of Lily's intimate encounters with various men.

"Lily Green," he murmured, his voice dripping with disgust. "Did you really think I'd let you manipulate me forever?"

His phone buzzed again—a text from an unknown number: "Mr. Johnson, the recording you requested is ready. We can release it anytime."

Michael tapped the screen lightly. "Wait for now."

He needed the perfect moment to strike.

At that very moment, Lily sat in Liam Parker's luxury car, completely unaware of the storm about to hit her.

"Liam," she purred, leaning against his shoulder, "if someone ever tries to hurt me, you'll protect me, won't you?"

Liam wrapped an arm around her waist, declaring confidently, "Of course. Who would dare touch my woman?"

Lily smiled in satisfaction, a flicker of triumph in her eyes.

She didn't know it yet, but the gears of fate had already begun turning—and the web of lies she'd so carefully woven was about to unravel completely.
###Chapter 58: Michael's Counterattack

Lily Green's fingers frantically scrolled across her phone screen, her face growing paler by the second. She never expected Michael Johnson to humiliate her so ruthlessly.

@MichaelJohnsonV: Official statement—Ms. Lily Green and I have only ever maintained a professional working relationship. There has never been any personal involvement. To those spreading rumors: legal action will be taken.

The post exploded like a bomb, sending shockwaves through the entertainment industry. Michael's fans erupted in celebration, flooding Lily's social media with scathing comments.

"Lily, what do we do now?" Her assistant wrung her hands in panic.

Lily bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, the metallic tang spreading across her tongue. With trembling fingers, she dialed Richard Brown's number. "Richard, help me!"

Richard let out a cold laugh and played his trump card. Within minutes, a video went viral.

[Shocking! Lily Green Once Took Acid for Michael Johnson—Now Betrayed!]

The footage showed Lily throwing herself in front of Michael, nearly getting doused with acid. The horrifying scene instantly swayed public opinion.

[Michael is disgusting!]
[How could he betray her like this?]
[Unfollowing. I'm done.]

Michael stared at his phone, a smirk curling his lips. His fingers flew across the keyboard.

@MichaelJohnsonV: Yes, I picked her up from the police station that night—because she "saved" me. But now we all see how laughable that "heroic act" really was. Here's the truth.

He released a series of surveillance stills. The images clearly showed Lily wearing thick protective clothing, following the attacker, and timing her "rescue" perfectly.

The internet went wild.

[Holy crap! This is next-level scheming!]
[Lily the Fake Saint exposed!]
[Best clapback of the year!]

At Star Emperor Entertainment headquarters, Lucy White flipped through a script when Sophia Taylor burst in, waving her phone excitedly. "Lucy, look! Lily's reputation is crumbling!"

Lucy glanced at the trending topics and chuckled. "Michael didn't hold back this time."

"She's definitely lost that period drama lead!" Sophia crowed. "The director hates schemers like her."

Nathan King walked in with a stack of contracts. "Lucy, I read the script for that period drama. Want to consider it?"

Lucy closed her script and shook her head. "No need. What's meant for others isn't mine to take."

Nathan's eyes gleamed with approval. "That kind of integrity is rare in this industry."

Sunlight streamed through the window as Lucy tilted her face toward it. In this second life, she would live with her head held high. Let the likes of Lily wallow in their dirty games.
###Chapter 59: Feng Shui Master? You Must Be Joking

Fang Yan pushed several scripts toward Lucy White. "These are the recent offers. See if any interest you?"

Lucy's eyes lit up as she picked up the top fantasy script. "I want to try for the female supporting role."

She had loved this character in her past life. Back then, the director had initially wanted her for the role, but Richard Brown's interference led to it being snatched by an actress who had invested in the production. Unfortunately, that actress was later embroiled in a scandal, dragging the entire drama down with her.

Fang Yan raised an eyebrow. "This character has a compelling dark turn. If done well, it could really stand out." He paused. "But the shooting schedule is long. Are you sure?"

"I'm sure," Lucy replied without hesitation.

Seeing her determination, Fang Yan nodded. "Alright, I'll talk to the director."

"Thanks, Fang!" Lucy beamed.

Fang waved it off. "No need for thanks between us."

After finalizing the script, Lucy also chose a high-end watch endorsement. Fang approved of her choices. "The livestream variety show you're on is currently the most-watched. Keep up the momentum for the next episode."

"Mission accepted!" Lucy playfully saluted.

Just after lunch, Edward Johnson called.

"Lucy, can you come to the Wu residence right now?"

Without a second thought, Lucy had her driver take her there.

In front of the Wu family villa, Edward was speaking with a refined middle-aged man. Spotting Lucy, Edward smiled and waved her over. "Lucy, this is Bruce Wu, head of the Wu family."

Bruce Wu froze when he saw her. This girl—wearing a ponytail, white T-shirt, and jeans—was the feng shui master Edward had praised? This had to be a joke.

Though inwardly skeptical, Bruce kept his expression neutral. "Miss White, hello."

Lucy immediately sensed his doubt but didn’t take offense. "Hello, Mr. Wu."

Edward quickly smoothed things over. "Lucy's father was a master of metaphysics. She grew up immersed in this knowledge—her skills are impressive."

Still doubtful, Bruce said, "Then, Miss White, please take a look at the house first."

The ancestral home housed three generations of the Wu family. Recently, misfortune had struck repeatedly: the elderly patriarch broke his leg, the second son was hit by falling debris, and the third son was in a car accident. Desperate, Bruce had sought out a feng shui expert.

Lucy pulled an ancient compass from her bag—a tool her father had left her for assessing energy flows.

After walking through the garden, the compass suddenly spun wildly near a flowerbed.

"Dig here," Lucy pointed.

The servants hesitated but began digging. After half a meter with no findings, Bruce frowned. "Should we keep going?"

Lucy calculated silently. "Three more feet."

Miraculously, at exactly three feet, a shovel struck something hard.

A dirt-covered wooden box was unearthed. As a servant reached to open it, Lucy stopped him sharply. "Don’t touch it!"

She took the box, using the compass to suppress the dark energy seeping from it, then slowly lifted the lid—

"Ah!" Edward gasped.

Inside was a blackened, crimson heart.

"This is a cursed object made from a black dog’s heart," Lucy said grimly. "Buried here, it slowly drains the family’s fortune—causing financial ruin at best, and at worst..."

She didn’t finish, but Bruce’s face had already turned ashen.

"How long has it been buried?" His voice trembled.

Lucy calculated again. "About six months. In the last two months, hasn’t the frequency of accidents increased?"

Bruce’s legs gave out, and he nearly collapsed.
###Chapter 60: This Girl is Extraordinary

Bruce Wu's expression darkened as he performed a quick calculation with his fingers.

"Come to think of it, the troubles in my household started six months ago," he said gravely. "My wife loved tending to her garden—she was always pruning and planting. She was the first to experience something strange."

It had been a sunny afternoon when his wife went swimming with her best friend and suddenly began drowning.

"She claimed someone was pulling her feet underwater," Bruce furrowed his brows. "But the security footage showed nothing—just her struggling desperately."

At the time, everyone dismissed it as a hallucination.

But over the next two months, his father, second brother, and third brother all suffered misfortunes. The family business also encountered continuous setbacks.

The Feng Shui masters they consulted all claimed there was no issue, attributing it to mere bad luck.

Until today—

"Miss Lucy, is there anything else in the garden?" Bruce's attitude had completely shifted.

He had never believed in such things, but this young woman had pinpointed the problem with unsettling accuracy.

Lucy White put away her compass. "Just this one object. But your ancestral home is steeped in dark energy—there must be more."

The three of them hurried inside.

The compass needle spun wildly.

Lucy dug out black stones from five flower pots and retrieved two talismans hidden in the layers of a newly purchased cabinet.

"These stones are tainted with graveyard energy, and the talismans are draining your family's fortune," she said solemnly. "If left unchecked for another six months, lives would have been lost."

A chill ran down Bruce's spine.

He had always dismissed Feng Shui as superstition—but now—

The objects on the table exuded an eerie coldness that made his skin crawl.

"Master Lucy, what should we do now?" His voice trembled.

"Each of you needs a dispelling talisman," Lucy said, taking out cinnabar. "Then, go to a temple and acquire blessed objects to safeguard your home."

Bruce panicked. "I don't know anything about this—could you—"

"I happen to be free today. I'll accompany you to the antique market," Lucy interrupted. "But first, we must dispose of these."

She spread out a talisman paper and began writing with swift, precise strokes.

Edward Johnson and Bruce watched in breathless silence. The room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
###Chapter 61: Metaphysical Arts

Lucy White lightly twirled the vermilion brush between her fingers, effortlessly tracing intricate sigils across the yellow parchment with fluid strokes.

"Is... is it done already?" Bruce Wu's eyes widened as Lucy casually gathered the items from the table and tossed them into a basin of water.

As she murmured an arcane incantation, the talisman suddenly ignited—without a single spark.

"Heavens!" Edward Johnson gasped.

What happened next was even more astonishing—the burning talisman didn’t extinguish upon hitting the water. Instead, eerie blue flames engulfed the submerged objects, flickering beneath the surface.

Bruce stared at the basin, stunned. This was ordinary tap water—he’d filled it himself.

The flames burned relentlessly for fifteen minutes, until every last item dissolved into ash and vanished without a trace.

Meanwhile, in a suburban villa—

A robed elder in black suddenly choked, spewing dark blood before collapsing like a felled tree.

"Done." Lucy dusted off her sleeves. "The backlash hit its caster. Let’s head to the antique market now."

Bruce’s gaze toward Lucy had completely transformed. This was no ordinary young woman—she was a true master in disguise.

At the antique market, Bruce led them with practiced ease to a secluded loft.

"This jade pendant..." Lucy’s fingertips glided over a piece of flawless white jade. "It carries traces of auspicious energy—perfect for you."

She selected two more jade pendants and a carnelian bracelet. "These are for the three most affected individuals."

The shop owner, Donald Li, watched in awe. "You have an exceptional eye, miss. These pieces are—"

"Late Qing to early Republic-era artifacts, steeped in a century of sacred incense," Lucy finished smoothly, picking up a set of ancient coins. "I’ll take these."

Donald’s pupils constricted—no one had recognized the true value of those Five Emperor Coins in the three years he’d owned them.

"Master Lucy," he said, suddenly deferential, "might I have your contact information?"

After leaving the market, the trio returned to the Wu residence.

Lucy arranged the newly acquired coins into a protective formation throughout the house. Bruce could swear the air itself felt fresher.

"Will you draw the talismans now?" he asked cautiously.

She nodded, spreading out fresh parchment. As her brush danced across the paper, a faint golden aura shimmered around her.

Eighteen talismans flowed from her hand in one seamless session.

"Wear them close to your skin," she instructed, folding the parchment into triangles. "They’ll ward off a single calamity. Replace them immediately if they blacken."

As Bruce accepted them reverently, a thought struck him. "Master Lucy, can you tell who’s targeting my family?"

Lucy’s fingers moved in a quick divination. "Your ancestors accumulated great virtue—enough to bless three generations. But now..." She suddenly frowned. "Wait. Is anyone in your household born in the Year of the Tiger?"

"My younger brother!" Bruce shot to his feet. "It’s his zodiac year!"

Lucy’s expression darkened. "Get to the hospital—now! The enemy is trying to—"

Before she could finish, Bruce’s phone vibrated violently. A nurse’s panicked voice blared through the speaker:

"Mr. Wu! Your brother just went into cardiac arrest!"
###Chapter 62: The Parkers' Dirty Tactics

Lucy White tapped her fingers lightly, performing a quick divination.

"Check which family has been stealing your business deals recently," she said, lifting her gaze. "Whoever benefits is the mastermind."

Bruce Wu's expression darkened instantly. "All our lost contracts were snatched by the Parkers." His jaw clenched. "They even poached my people."

"So it is the Parkers." His knuckles cracked under the force of his grip.

The Parkers had never built their empire cleanly, always resorting to underhanded methods. For the past six months, the Wu family had suffered continuous misfortunes while the Parkers thrived—now it all made sense.

Lucy tapped the coffee table. "Do they employ a blood mage?"

"The Parker patriarch believes in that nonsense," Bruce sneered. "Last year, he even hosted some so-called 'master' as an honored guest."

"Then there's no doubt." Lucy stood. "I've already cleansed the dark energy. The caster will suffer the backlash."

She handed him a talisman. "Place this at your company's main entrance. It'll protect you for three months."

Bruce accepted it with both hands, then froze. "There's a traitor in my house?"

"Who else could've buried those cursed objects in your garden?" Lucy gave him a meaningful look.

A ruthless glint flashed in Bruce's eyes. It was time for a purge.

"Eight million," Lucy quoted, then added, "A 20% discount for Uncle Edward's sake."

When the payment notification chimed, Edward Johnson's eye twitched. This girl charges like a tycoon.

After seeing Lucy off, Bruce clapped Edward on the shoulder. "Edward, I won't forget this favor."

Edward forced a laugh. "I just made the introduction..." He never expected the girl to be this capable.

"Count me in against the Parkers." Edward narrowed his eyes. Perfect chance to avenge Lucy—and maybe win Rachel back.

Bruce's eyes grew moist. True friendship shines in adversity.

Johnson Family Villa

Michael Johnson stared blankly at his phone wallpaper—a photo of Lucy on her eighteenth birthday.

"Solved?" He straightened abruptly when his father entered.

Edward raised a brow. "Your Uncle Bruce calls her 'Master White' now." Spotting his son's phone, he sighed inwardly.

"She was always extraordinary." Michael traced the photo with his thumb, voice hoarse.

Edward couldn't resist prodding. "Regretting it now?"

The young man's eyes reddened instantly.

"Prepare for the worst." Edward recalled his own years-long struggle to win Rachel back and patted his son's shoulder. "It's a long road ahead."

Like his decade-long search for Rachel, every day had been torment. But who told him to be... a fool back then?

Silence engulfed the living room, broken only by the ticking of the wall clock.
###Chapter 63: Richard Brown's Downfall

Edward Johnson slammed his hand on the table in frustration. "What happened to that sharp mind of yours? Getting played by a woman and your own agent—what were you thinking?"

Michael Johnson ran a hand through his tousled short hair, agitated. "I don’t know. It was like I was under some kind of spell, always feeling like I had to take care of Lily Green. As for Richard Brown..." His voice dropped. "I let my guard down."

"Regretting it now, are you?" Edward scoffed. "If you hadn’t been so blind, Lucy might still be here."

Michael’s expression darkened. "I know I messed up."

Edward sighed. "So, what are you going to do about Richard?"

A cold glint flashed in Michael’s eyes. "I’ll make sure he never works in this industry again—not a single penny left to his name."

"Now that’s more like it." Edward nodded approvingly. "The future head of the Johnson family can’t afford to show weakness when it counts."

The next day, Michael’s social media exploded.

He publicly announced his termination of Richard Brown’s contract, attaching a legal notice. Almost immediately, gossip accounts began flooding the internet with damning revelations:

#RichardBrownExploitsActresses
#RichardBrownTakesBribes
#RichardBrownBulliesNewcomers

The most shocking bombshell? Leaked intimate photos of Richard with multiple wealthy older women—all of whom had funneled resources to Lily Green.

The entertainment industry erupted in outrage.

Artists who had suffered under Richard’s abuse came forward, and the official social media pages of Starlight Entertainment were swarmed by furious fans.

"Fire Richard Brown!"
"A scumbag like him doesn’t deserve to be an agent!"

Lucy White’s fans joined the fray, dredging up every past incident of Richard mistreating her.

Richard’s home was vandalized with paint, leaving him too terrified to step outside for three days.

David Wilson issued the termination order himself—and even Richard’s powerful backers didn’t dare intervene.

When the dismissal papers landed in Richard’s hands, he stared in disbelief.

"This can’t be happening..." His hands shook as he scanned the penalty clauses. "This is a death sentence!"

He frantically dialed every contact he could think of, but every so-called friend had already blocked him.

In desperation, he turned to Lily Green.

"Lily, you’re the only one who can help me now!"

But Lily was already in tears. "Richard, I can’t even save myself! The internet is calling me a gold-digger who slept her way to the top..."

Richard left in utter despair.

Meanwhile, Lucy was visiting the Wilson residence.

"Master Lucy, we can’t thank you enough," Mrs. Wilson said, clasping Lucy’s hands. "Emily has improved so much."

Lucy smiled gently. "It was my pleasure."

Before she left, the Wilsons handed her another generous red envelope.

Back home, Lucy took out cinnabar and yellow paper, crafting an academic talisman.

She posted a photo of it online with the caption:
@LucyWhiteV: Share this Academic Talisman! The first 3,000 reposts will receive its blessing—guaranteed to boost your exam performance and studies!

The comments section erupted instantly:
[OMG I got it!]
[Must repost Master Lucy’s talisman!]
[Pfft. More fake mysticism.]
[Haters, didn’t you learn from the last livestream?]

All 3,000 slots were claimed in seconds, leaving countless fans lamenting their missed chance.

And as the frenzy unfolded, Richard Brown dragged his suitcase through the streets—a broken man, slinking out of the city in disgrace.
###Chapter 64: Don't Pretend We're Close

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Lucy White popped the last bite of her sandwich into her mouth. The doorbell rang.

"This early?" She wiped her hands and hurried to the door.

The moment she opened it, Lucy froze. The production crew's camera was pointed straight at her, an assistant holding up a selfie stick while live comments scrolled rapidly across the screen.

"Surprise livestream?" Lucy arched a brow. "You guys really know how to play."

She stepped aside to let the crew in, casually straightening the slippers by the door. The camera panned to the dining area, capturing Noah White mid-sip of his milk. A drop lingered on his fair cheek as he blinked up at the lens like a startled fawn.

[OMG what kind of angelic little brother is this?!]
[Is that face even real??]
[Look at me, little bro! I’ll wait for you to grow up!]

The comments exploded instantly.

Noah recovered quickly, offering the camera a shy smile. "Hi everyone, I'm Lucy's brother."

He turned to his sister, eyes sparkling. "You look really pretty today, sis."

Lucy ruffled his hair. "Flatterer."

[I’m so jealous of their sibling bond!]
[He’s so sweet and adorable!]
[Someone sign this kid to an agency already!]

A crew member gaped. "Ms. White, has your brother ever considered joining the industry?"

"Not for now." Lucy chuckled. "He’s still in school."

Ten minutes later, Lucy was packed and ready to leave. Noah followed her all the way to the elevator, murmuring, "Don’t forget to eat on time, okay?"

"I know." She pinched his cheek. "Be good while I’m gone."

At the airport, the trainees were already waiting in the lounge. Lucy had barely taken her seat when familiar clicking heels approached.

Lily Green strode in, dressed head-to-toe in the latest Chanel set, her makeup red-carpet-ready. Her gaze swept the room before landing on Lucy, and she instantly brightened.

"Lucy~" she cooed, rushing over to link arms. "It’s been forever! I missed you so much!"

Lucy sidestepped the contact smoothly. "Ms. Green, we’re not close."

Lily’s smile faltered before she forced it back. "Why so cold? We’re—"

"What?" Lucy cut in, lips quirking. "Fake besties? Or just delusions on your part?"

The lounge fell silent, all eyes locked on them. Lily’s face flushed, her eyes welling up instantly.

"Lucy, if I’ve done something to upset you—"

"Stop." Lucy raised a hand. "First, it’s Ms. White to you. Second, there’s no misunderstanding—just facts."

She stood, looking down at Lily. "Like how you hooked up with Michael Johnson behind my back."

The words dropped like a bomb. Everyone gasped. Lily turned ghostly pale, her lips trembling wordlessly.

The livestream comments erupted:
[HOLY CRAP THIS TEA IS SCALDING!]
[Lucy is savage!]
[Lily the fake sweetheart exposed!]
[FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!]

Just then, other guests arrived, breaking the tension. Lily seized the chance to slink into a corner, typing frantically on her phone.

Lucy watched her with a cold smirk. This time, she wouldn’t give her so-called "best friend" any room to scheme.
###Chapter 65: The Oscar Winner Takes a Stand

Lily Green never expected Lucy White to confront her so bluntly on live broadcast.

A shadow flickered across her eyes before she quickly replaced it with a pitiful expression. "I thought after last episode, we were friends..." Her voice trembled, her eyes already glistening with unshed tears.

Lucy let out a cold laugh. "Friends?" She tapped the table lightly with her fingertips. "You nearly got me canceled with that photo scandal, and now you're pretending we're close?"

She turned to face the camera directly. "Let me make this clear—I don’t hold grudges, but I don’t forget either. I won’t start anything with you this episode, but stay out of my way."

The set fell silent.

No one had anticipated Lucy’s bluntness.

[OMG! Queen Lucy slays!]
[Finally, someone calls out Lily’s act!]
[That was so rude of Lucy!]

Lily paled, biting her lip. "I—I apologized for the photos... But we still have to work together..." Her words carried an unspoken accusation—Lucy was being unprofessional.

Then Ethan Smith chuckled.

"Honesty." His long fingers drummed the table. "That’s what the audience wants." He glanced at the director. "If we wanted fake politeness, we’d be filming a soap opera."

The director’s eyes lit up. "Ethan’s right! Authenticity is what this show is about!"

Lucy blinked in surprise, turning to Ethan. Under the studio lights, his sharp profile looked even more striking.

A warmth spread through her chest.

For the first time, someone had publicly taken her side.

Michael Johnson clenched his fists, about to speak—but Ethan beat him to it.

Lily’s eyes welled up. "Ethan, I wasn’t—"

"Forcing others to play along with your act," Ethan cut in calmly, "is that your version of authenticity?"

Lily froze as if struck by lightning.

Her idol—the man she admired most—had just exposed her on national television.

The director quickly intervened. "Alright, everyone! This episode’s theme is—"

(The story continues...)

[Ethan is KING!]
[Now THAT’S a real man!]
[Lily’s mask finally slipped LOL]
[Lucy x Ethan forever!]
###Chapter 66: Island Survival Adventure

"Wow!" Daniel Miller dramatically covered his mouth. "Ethan Smith just called someone out—so cool!"

The atmosphere instantly turned awkward. Lily Green's face flushed with embarrassment, but she forced a composed smile. The other guests tactfully averted their eyes, pretending not to notice her discomfort.

Robert Lee cleared his throat, changing the subject. "Director, why did you bring us to the airport? Planning something big?"

The director winked mysteriously. "You guessed it! This time, we're going for something thrilling—"

"Abroad?" Olivia Davis's eyes lit up.

"Exactly!" The director clapped. "A newly discovered uninhabited island in Southeast Asia—one week of survival challenge!"

"What?!" William Jones nearly jumped from his seat. "Are you serious? None of us even know how to start a fire!"

The director was prepared. "Don't worry, we've hired a professional mercenary team for full security."

The camera panned over the guests' reactions: Daniel slumped in his chair, looking defeated; Robert stroked his chin thoughtfully; Olivia nervously twisted her fingers; William stared in disbelief.

"Ethan, what do you think?" the director asked cautiously.

Ethan Smith leaned back lazily in his seat. "Sounds fun."

The director exhaled in relief, then turned to Michael Johnson. The top-tier celebrity was staring intently at—

"Lucy?" The director followed his gaze to Lucy White.

Lucy toyed with the bracelet on her wrist, a faint smile on her lips. "Island survival? Perfect."

Michael immediately chimed in, "I'm in too."

Lily, left out, dug her nails into her palm. She forced a smile. "Sounds exciting."

[Live comments exploded]
[Whoa! A livestream survival show? The director's going all out!]
[Ethan actually agreed? He usually hates these grueling shows!]
[Lucy seems so calm—does she actually know survival skills?]
[Pfft, talk is cheap. Let’s see if she cries later.]

On the plane, Lucy found herself seated next to Ethan.

"Thanks for earlier," she murmured.

Ethan turned slightly, catching the faint scent of gardenias in her hair. "I just told the truth." He paused. "Ever considered acting?"

Lucy raised a brow. "Of course."

"There's a lead role in a period drama that suits you." Ethan pulled out an embossed business card. "The director's a friend."

Lucy took it, her fingers brushing his palm. Both froze for a second.

"I'll think about it seriously," she said, tucking the card away—unaware of Michael’s dark glare from behind.

The plane cut through the clouds, heading toward an unknown adventure. Little did they know, this seemingly ordinary survival challenge was about to uncover a shocking secret...


###Chapter 67: The Mysterious Talisman

Ethan Smith gazed at her radiant smile, his eyes softening unconsciously.

"Don't mention it. I genuinely think you're perfect for this role."

His slender fingers swiped across his phone screen. "Once this livestream wraps up, I’ll have the producer contact you directly."

Lucy White’s eyes curved into crescents. "Sounds great!"

The two leaned in, studying the script together, their hushed exchanges drawing curious glances from the other guests.

Everyone knew Ethan—the so-called "gentleman" of the silver screen—kept others at arm's length. Yet Lucy was the first to receive such warmth from him.

Michael Johnson clenched his fists, his glare fixed on the pair. He’d wanted to sit beside Lucy, only to be beaten to it by him.

Lily Green bit her lip, her nails digging into her palms. She’d never seen Ethan treat anyone with such tenderness. Why did Lucy deserve special treatment?

Turning to Michael, a calculating glint flashed in her eyes. Seizing the moment as the plane jolted, she "accidentally" spilled water on Daniel Miller.

"Professor Miller, I’m so sorry!" she apologized with pitiable sweetness.

Daniel frowned at his soaked shirt, muttering a stiff "It’s fine" before heading off to change.

Lily seized the chance to slide into the seat beside Michael, her voice trembling. "Michael… are you still mad at me?"

A splitting headache struck him. A seductive whisper slithered through his mind: She needs your protection…

"Get away!" He shoved her aside, staggering toward the restroom.

Lily froze under the mocking stares around her. Her grip on her skirt tightened until the fabric nearly tore.

Inside the restroom, Michael splashed cold water on his face. The unnatural urge finally faded, leaving his reflection cold-eyed and grim.

"Something’s wrong…" he muttered.

Returning to his seat, he fixed Lily with an icy glare. "This is Daniel’s spot."

Tears welling, Lily slunk away—only to bump into Daniel, now changed. His knowing smirk sent prickles down her spine.

Three hours later, the helicopter touched down on a secluded island.

Azure waves lapped against lush jungles as five burly men approached.

The director introduced them. "Your survival guides and bodyguards." He stressed, "They won’t intervene unless your lives are at risk."

The crew distributed standard backpacks. Lucy inventoried hers: camouflage suit, combat boots, rope, entrenching tool…

While others rummaged for skincare, she withdrew yellow talisman paper and a compass, both glinting mysteriously in the sunlight.

[Live comments exploded]
"WTF is Lucy doing?!"
"Drawing talismans on a survival show? Peak entertainment!"
"Does she seriously think paper scraps will save her?"

Olivia Davis couldn’t resist. "Will those actually help?"

Lucy traced the talisman’s edge, smiling wordlessly. The sea breeze tousled her hair, lending her an ethereal air.

No one noticed two bodyguards stiffen at the sight of her compass.
###Chapter 68: Snatched Again

The director and crew members twitched at the sight of the talismans Lucy White pulled from her bag.

"Will those things actually help in a survival challenge?" someone muttered under their breath.

Ethan Smith, however, tilted his lips in amusement, a glint of laughter in his eyes. Of course—she always had her own unique way.

"Lucy, are those talismans for exorcising ghosts?" Daniel Miller teased.

Lucy winked mysteriously. "You’ll find out soon enough."

"That cryptic?" Daniel scratched his head. "Now I have to keep watching."

As everyone packed, most brought extra bags—except Lucy and Ethan, who stuck with the standard-issue backpacks provided by the production crew.

Noticing this, Michael Johnson silently tossed aside his excess luggage.

Meanwhile, Lily Green and Olivia Davis were still stuffing cosmetics into their bags, drawing a wave of sarcastic live comments.

"How are we splitting into teams?" Ethan suddenly asked.

All eyes turned to the director.

The director had originally planned to stir up drama, but under Ethan’s pointed gaze, he caved.

"Free teaming," the director said with a dry laugh. "Two guests and eight trainees per group."

Before the words fully left his mouth, Ethan turned to Lucy. "Team up?"

"Sure," Lucy agreed easily.

Lucas Young and his four friends immediately rushed over. "Lucy, take us with you!"

Nathan King raised his hand eagerly. "We want to stay with Ethan!"

In the blink of an eye, their ten-person squad was complete.

Daniel groaned. "Ethan, you’re too fast!"

Michael’s face darkened, his fists clenched white.

Meanwhile, at the Johnson family villa…

Edward Johnson shook his head at the screen. "This dumb kid—always a step behind."

Rachel Johnson, however, smiled approvingly. "Ethan’s a good one. Knows what he wants."

"Wife, that guy’s clearly doing it on purpose!" Edward protested.

"So what?" Rachel shot him a look. "At least he acts. Unlike our son, who can’t even string a sentence together."

Edward: "…"

Back on the island, Robert Lee sighed. "Ethan, leave some chances for the rest of us."

Ethan arched a brow. "First come, first served."

Daniel turned to Michael. "Want to team up?"

"I refuse to be in the same group as Lily," Michael stated bluntly.

The director nearly choked. "You’d really leave two girls stranded?"

"Absolutely," Michael said flatly.

The live comments exploded:
[LMAO Michael’s brutal honesty!]
[The director’s face is priceless!]
[That’s our top-tier star—no filter!]
[Wow, zero chivalry…]

Lily’s face cycled through shades of green and white, her nails digging into her palms.

The director rubbed his temples. "Rules say you must take one female guest. Choose."

The air froze.
###Chapter 69: The Talisman's Power

"Mandatory teams?" Michael Johnson's icy glare at the director could have frozen the entire set.

The live comments exploded:

[The director's stirring up drama!]
[Michael, just walk out! This show isn't worth it!]
[Did the production team take bribes from that fake sweetheart Lily?]

Daniel Miller subtly took a step back, wary of Michael's infamous temper. Everyone knew the top-tier celebrity had no qualms about calling out even the investors.

To everyone's surprise, Michael suddenly smirked. "Fine. I choose Olivia Davis."

"Huh?" Daniel blinked. This wasn’t the script he’d anticipated.

The director, fearing Michael might change his mind, immediately declared, "It's settled! Daniel and Lily Green will be a team."

Lily bit her lip hard, nails digging into her palms. She never expected Michael to pick a rookie over her.

"Looking forward to working with you, Daniel," she forced a sweet smile, though internally, she cursed everyone present.

Daniel gave a strained chuckle, already dreading the inevitable chaos Lily would bring.

As the teams finalized, two instructors in tactical gear stepped forward.

"Victor Stone," the stoic one introduced curtly.

"Hank Cooper," the other added with a grin. "For the next seven days, you'll follow us through this uninhabited island."

While the others changed into their gear, Lucy White sat on a rock, sketching something intently.

"Drawing a talisman?" Ethan Smith appeared behind her without warning.

Without looking up, Lucy replied, "Cooling talisman. Want to try?"

The moment Ethan took the slip of paper, his pupils contracted. The stifling heat instantly gave way to a refreshing coolness, even his tactical gear no longer clinging uncomfortably.

"Effective," he remarked casually, pocketing the talisman.

Daniel, now in his gear, caught the exchange.

"Lucy, are these for sale?" He dramatically fanned himself. "This heat is unbearable!"

Lucy tossed him one. "Keep it."

"Holy—!" Daniel swore the second he held it. "This is insane! It's like carrying an AC!"

Robert Lee skeptically edged closer. "Really that good?"

Three seconds later, the tough actor’s composure shattered. "Lucy, this talisman... is next-level!"

The live feed flooded with disbelief:

[Scripted much?]
[The producers are shamelessly pushing Lucy now?]
[Even Ethan, Daniel, and Robert are in on this act?]

Lily lingered at the fringe, watching Lucy bask in the spotlight, her eyes darkening with resentment.

"Move out," Victor’s stern voice cut through the chatter.

Lucy folded her last talisman, her gaze lingering on the dense jungle ahead.

The real challenge had only just begun.
###Chapter 70: The Metaphysics Prodigy Strikes Back

"No way!" Olivia Davis's eyes widened as she turned the thin yellow talisman over in her fingers.

Daniel Miller snatched it back with a smug grin. "Why would I lie? Try it yourself if you don't believe me!"

Robert Lee leaned in, lowering his voice conspiratorially. "I already tested it. Feels like carrying an AC in your pocket."

The other guests immediately perked up at this.

Michael Johnson was the first to take the talisman. The moment his fingertips brushed the paper, a wave of coolness spread through his hand. His pupils contracted slightly as he instinctively glanced at Lucy White, who was quietly sketching another symbol.

"Well?" William Jones pressed eagerly.

Michael's throat bobbed. "Incredible," he admitted, voice tight.

Lily Green lingered at the edge of the group, nails digging into her palms. Her gaze burned into the talisman being passed around, turmoil raging inside her.

Impossible… This has to be a special effect arranged by the production crew!

"Let me try," she blurted, her voice pitched higher than usual.

When Olivia handed her the talisman, Lily's fingers trembled slightly. The instant the cooling sensation flooded her body, her smile nearly cracked.

"It's… quite refreshing," she forced out, though internally, her mind reeled.

The director rushed over. "I want in on this!"

Five minutes later, he cradled the talisman like a treasure. "Ms. White, how long does this last?"

"About a week," Lucy replied without looking up, her brush gliding effortlessly across another sheet.

Daniel immediately sidled up to her. "Lucy, darling, could you spare one for our team too?"

"Was already planning to make one for each group," she said with a light chuckle, sliding the finished talisman toward him.

[Holy crap! An actual metaphysics prodigy!]
[Where are the haters now? Care to explain this?]
[My queen is unstoppable! Absolute legend!]

Victor Stone and Hank Cooper exchanged a glance, mutual astonishment flashing in their eyes. As former special forces, they understood the implications better than most.

"Ms. White," Hank suddenly spoke up, "could we talk privately?"

Lucy didn’t pause her brushwork. "After filming."

The trainees erupted in excitement:
"It really works!"
"Ms. White is the GOAT!"
"I'm officially a fan now!"

Lily lingered at the periphery, her expression shifting between disbelief and resentment. Her gaze bored into Lucy’s back, already scheming to visit that master after leaving the island…

"Move out!" Hank commanded, and the group advanced into the jungle.

Along the way, Hank tested them casually. "Anyone recognize these plants?"

Blank stares all around—until Lucy stopped abruptly, pointing at an unassuming weed. "Dragon's Breath Herb. Neutralizes snake venom."

Hank's pupils constricted. Exactly what I was going to ask.

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 71 The Botany Prodigy's Dominance

"You actually know this?" Hank Cooper's fingers trembled as he pointed at the unassuming fern.

Lucy White didn't even glance up. "Serrated fern. Crushed leaves can stop bleeding."

Hank, refusing to believe, pointed at seven more plants in rapid succession. Lucy identified each effortlessly, even detailing their growth cycles and medicinal uses.

"No way!" Hank grabbed his short hair in frustration. "It took me five years apprenticing under my uncle to learn these!"

Victor Stone leaned against a tree trunk, chuckling. "Looks like the 'Walking Plant Encyclopedia' title has a new owner."

Lucy twirled a leaf between her fingers. "My mom's a horticulturist. I've been identifying plants since I was three."

[Live comments exploded]
[What kind of photographic memory is this?!]
[That soldier's existential crisis face is killing me]
[Is Lucy cheating or something?]

Hank suddenly dropped to one knee, clasping his hands dramatically. "Master, accept this humble disciple!"

The group burst into laughter. Ethan Smith's eyes gleamed with admiration. "How about Professor Lucy gives us a botany lesson?"

"Yes! Way better than textbooks!" Daniel Miller raised his hand eagerly.

The hike transformed into Lucy's showcase. She explained plant characteristics while sprinkling in fascinating trivia—like how certain orchids mimic female bees to trick males into pollination, leaving everyone awestruck.

"Wait!" Hank grabbed her wrist as she reached for a plant. "That's poisonous, right?"

Lucy shook the red berries in her palm. "Perfectly safe with mint leaves. Even boosts alertness." She popped one into her mouth.

Hank turned pale, but when Lucy remained energetic five minutes later, he surrendered completely.

Botanists in the livestream panicked:
[Some of these remedies aren't even in academic papers!]
[Someone record this—it's priceless field research!]

Three hours later, the other guests were dragging their feet. Robert Lee collapsed onto the ground. "I'm done..."

"Let's camp here." Hank checked the map, then smirked. "But dinner's DIY tonight~"

Lily Green nearly cried. Her blistered feet begged for energy bars.

"We're catching fish," Lucy announced.

Ryan Clark blinked. "Where? This is middle of nowhere."

Lucy pointed southeast. "River one kilometer away. Determined by vegetation patterns and slope gradient."

The group: "......"

Is she even human?

Jason Wright timidly raised his hand. "Professor Lucy... are you actually a rainforest spirit?"

[We bow to the master] flooded the screen. The director grinned at skyrocketing ratings.

"Coming?" Lucy already rolled up her pants. "Fish sleep early."

Ethan was first to follow. "Absolutely."

Moonlight silvered Lucy's silhouette. Watching her, Hank suddenly saw the familiar jungle through new, wondrous eyes.
###Chapter 72: The Survival Pro

"Ms. White, how did you know there was a river here?" Noah Adams blinked his round eyes, looking at her with pure admiration.

The rest of the team turned to Lucy White in unison, their expressions brimming with curiosity.

Lucy idly twirled a leaf between her fingers. "The humidity in the air, and the way these plants grow."

"Humidity?" Daniel Miller sniffed dramatically. "I can't smell anything!"

"That's a gift," Lucy said with a playful wink.

[OMG that wink just killed me!]
[How does she make even twirling a leaf look so mesmerizing?]

Hank Cooper couldn’t help chiming in. "We could make an educated guess, but not as accurately as Lucy."

"There should be a water source within three kilometers," he added.

"Which just proves our Ms. White is the best!" Ryan Clark puffed out his chest proudly, like a preening peacock.

Hank sighed and nodded. "True enough."

The group followed Lucy’s direction, pushing through the dense jungle where vines crisscrossed the untamed path.

Fifteen minutes later.

"A river! There really is a river!" Jason Wright bolted forward, nearly tripping over a gnarled root.

Hank checked his specialized watch and raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Exactly one kilometer from camp."

"Ms. White is unbeatable!" the trainees cheered in unison.

Lucy stood by the riverbank, sunlight scattering like gold dust across the water. Suddenly, she crouched down. "Fish!"

Several of the boys immediately kicked off their shoes and splashed into the water, flailing like a flock of ducks.

Half an hour later.

"These fish must be supernatural!" Daniel collapsed on the shore, utterly defeated.

Lucy chuckled. "Use branches to make spears, or weave a net."

"A net! We want to learn how to make a net!" The trainees instantly perked up.

Ethan Smith quietly sharpened a branch. "I’ll try the first method."

He rolled up his sleeves, revealing well-defined forearms. Lucy’s gaze lingered for a moment.

"That one looks good," she pointed to a plump fish.

Ethan’s focus sharpened. With a flick of his wrist—

Splash!

The sharpened branch pierced cleanly through the fish, sending droplets flying.

"Whoa!" The group gasped.

Lucy clapped. "Impressive, Mr. Smith!"

Ethan’s lips curved slightly. "Good teaching."

[OMG what kind of divine chemistry is this?!]
[The way Ethan looks at Lucy is so soft!]
[Just get married already!]

Working in perfect sync, they soon had five or six fish skewered.

Then the live comments exploded:

"Smith & White forever!"
"Ethan found his treasure!"

In a CEO’s office.

Edward Johnson glared at his phone screen and typed furiously: "The heart-and-soul pairing is better!"

Instantly, he was drowned in replies:

"Michael Johnson isn’t worthy of our Lucy!"
"Ex-boyfriends shouldn’t even try!"

Edward: "..."

This generation of netizens was impossible!

Meanwhile, the trainees finally finished weaving their net.

"Watch this!" Ryan flung it out with all his might—

Only for the net to tangle into a knot.

Ethan took the net from Lucy’s hands. "Let me."

His long fingers moved deftly, sending the net soaring in a perfect arc. When he pulled it back, the mesh was teeming with wriggling fish.

"So cool!" Jason’s eyes sparkled.

Lucy suddenly pointed at the water. "There’s a bigger school over there."

Ethan turned—only to slip on a mossy rock. He lost his balance—

"Careful!"

Lucy instinctively reached out to steady him.

The next second, both of them tumbled into the river.

Water erupted around them in a spectacular splash.
###Chapter 73: Spoiled Beyond Measure

The golden hues of the setting sun draped over the treetops of the primeval forest.

Lucy White and her group returned with a bountiful haul, their hands weighed down by heavy catches—over thirty fish gleaming silver under the sunlight.

"Wow! You actually caught this many?" Daniel Miller's eyes widened, the energy bar in his hand suddenly seeming far less appetizing.

Lucy shook the fish in her grasp, a sly smile playing on her lips. "Tonight, you'll have to watch us eat."

Daniel and the others groaned in protest.

Hank Cooper stepped beside Lucy, admiration clear in his eyes. "I didn’t expect you to be so skilled at wilderness survival."

"Flattery won’t get you extra fish," Lucy quipped, placing the fish on a flat stone and deftly beginning to clean them.

Her slender fingers moved with practiced ease, scales falling away like snowflakes. Ethan Smith appeared beside her without a sound, silently offering his combat knife.

"Thanks." Lucy took the blade, her fingertips brushing against his palm for the briefest moment.

Ethan's gaze flickered, the corners of his lips lifting unconsciously.

"How are you planning to cook these?" Hank asked curiously.

Lucy smirked. "Some grilled, some as sashimi. The lemons I picked earlier will come in handy."

"So you planned this all along!" Hank exclaimed in realization.

Lucy winked. "Call it foresight."

She then gathered wild herbs and berries nearby before returning to camp as darkness fully settled.

The crackling campfire cast flickering light over the eager faces of the group.

"Watch closely." Lucy took the knife, her wrist flicking with precision as translucent slices of fish fluttered onto banana leaves like falling snow.

"Damn! That knife work is insane!" Ryan Clark gasped.

Ethan's gaze remained fixed on her focused profile, the firelight softening her features.

"Ethan, want to try?" Lucy picked up a slice of sashimi, dipped it in lemon juice, and held it to his lips.

Ethan paused briefly before leaning in to accept it.

"How is it?" Lucy asked expectantly.

"Sweet and fresh. The best sashimi I’ve ever had," Ethan replied, warmth filling his eyes.

[OMG the feeding game is strong!]
[Ethan's gaze is so tender!]
[This ship has sailed—I'm onboard!]

Meanwhile, Michael Johnson clenched his fists, his expression dark as he glared at the scene.

"Grilled fish is ready!" Jason Wright announced excitedly, rushing over with skewers.

Lucy took one, carefully removing the bones before handing it to Ethan. "Eat it while it's hot."

"What about yours?" Ethan didn’t take it.

"Mine’s almost done," Lucy said, waving her own fish.

Ethan split his portion in half. "We’ll share."

Their eyes met, the firelight casting an intimate glow that made hearts race.

Hank took a bite of his fish and widened his eyes dramatically. "This is incredible! What have I been eating all my life?"

Even Victor Stone, usually reserved, nodded in agreement. "Impressive."

The trainees swarmed in, devouring the fish in moments.

"Hey! Save some for me!" Daniel whined from the outskirts.

Robert Lee patted his shoulder. "Next time, stick close to Lucy."

As the night deepened, the fire dimmed. Ethan subtly shifted closer to Lucy, shielding her from the chilly breeze.

"Cold?" he murmured.

Lucy shook her head—only to sneeze the next second.

Without hesitation, Ethan draped his jacket over her shoulders.

"Thanks." Lucy pulled the warm fabric tighter, the tips of her ears turning pink.

[This is too sweet!]
[Ethan knows all the right moves!]
[Someone call the wedding planner!]

In an unnoticed corner, Michael kicked a stone away with furious force.
###Chapter 74: Where the Heart Leads

Daniel Miller and the others were filled with regret. Had they known this would happen, they would’ve shamelessly stuck with Lucy White’s team.

Now, all they could do was stare longingly at the golden, crispy grilled fish and glistening sashimi, their stomachs growling in protest.

Ethan Smith leisurely picked up a slice of sashimi, the corner of his lips quirking up. "Stop staring. It won’t be yours no matter how much you look."

[LOL Ethan’s being such a tease!]
[Ethan guarding his food is adorable!]
[Daniel and the others look like they’re about to drool.]
[I can practically smell it through the screen!]
[What are the haters gonna say now?]

In the corner, Michael Johnson’s gaze never left Lucy.

The curve of her eyes when she smiled was exactly the same as before.

But now, that smile no longer belonged to him.

His chest tightened painfully, and he abruptly stood up, disappearing into the woods.

Lily Green noticed and immediately followed.

Under the moonlight, Michael leaned against a palm tree, lost in thought.

"Michael…" Lily called softly, "Are you okay?"

He frowned. "Stop following me."

"I’m just worried about you," she said, taking a step closer. "Ever since that incident, you’ve been avoiding me."

Suddenly, she reached out to hug him. "Give me another chance, please?"

Michael sidestepped her. "Have some self-respect."

Just then, a venomous snake slithered silently down from the branches above.

"Ah!" Lily shrieked, stumbling back before turning to flee.

Before Michael could react, the snake’s flickering tongue was inches from his face.

At the last second, a flash of silver cut through the air.

A machete pinned the snake to the tree with deadly precision.

"Lucy?" Michael stared in disbelief as the figure emerged from the shadows.

She retrieved the blade, her tone indifferent. "You alright?"

The moonlight softened the angles of her profile.

Michael suddenly grabbed her wrist, his voice trembling. "You still care about me, don’t you?"

His palm burned against her skin, his gaze so intense it could scorch.

Lucy gently pulled free. "I’d do the same for anyone."

The words doused him like ice water.

He laughed bitterly, releasing her. "Right. You’ve always been kind like that…"

In the distance, the production crew called out—the bonfire feast was about to begin.

Lucy turned to leave, only to hear a dull thud behind her.

Michael was on one knee, his face pale.

"What’s wrong?" She crouched beside him in alarm.

He gave a weak smile. "Nothing. Just… my legs gave out."

For a moment, he’d truly thought he was going to die.

Lucy sighed and helped him up. "Can you walk?"

He leaned heavily into her support.

"Barely," he murmured. "Let me lean on you for a bit."

She glared. "Don’t push your luck."

But she didn’t push him away.

Their shadows stretched long under the moonlight, merging into one.

Neither noticed Lily’s clenched fists hidden in the bushes nearby.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt no pain—only the searing burn of jealousy.
###Chapter 75: Giving You a Heads-Up

Lucy White abruptly shook off his hand and took two steps back, putting distance between them.

"Even raising a cat or dog for twenty years would foster some affection," she turned her face away. "I just don't want to watch you die in front of me."

She had long stopped hating Michael Johnson, but beyond that, there was nothing left.

Feeling the warmth in his palm vanish suddenly, Michael's heart ached. "You caring about me is enough."

Lucy couldn't be bothered to argue. She glanced around. "Where's Lily Green?"

She had clearly seen the woman follow Michael earlier and even heard a scream, so how had she disappeared in the blink of an eye?

At the mention of Lily, Michael's expression darkened. "She ran."

The moment the venomous snake lunged, she had bolted faster than a rabbit. For all her talk of loving him, she was the first to flee when danger struck.

Hah. Some "true love" that was.

Lucy scoffed. "Serves her right!"

Michael sighed. "You're that happy about it?"

"Of course." Lucy turned to leave. "I'm heading back."

Michael quickly blocked her path. "Wait, I need to talk to you."

"We have nothing to say." Her tone was icy.

Michael lowered his voice. "I've realized something's off about Lily."

Lucy paused. "What do you mean?"

"Ever since I met her, I couldn't control the urge to help her," Michael frowned. "Every time she's in trouble, a voice in my head pushes me to save her."

"Even on the plane earlier—I didn’t want to deal with her, but I inexplicably softened." He rubbed his temples. "Do you think I’m cursed?"

Lucy's heart skipped a beat.

The book hadn’t mentioned any of this. Had Michael been controlled in their past life too?

The thought made her bitter. So they had both been puppets of fate.

"Let me draw you a talisman," she sighed.

Michael's eyes lit up like an excited puppy. "You're the best, Lucy!"

Seeing his familiar smile, Lucy felt a fleeting sense of nostalgia but quickly snapped out of it. "Aunt Rachel said she wants to adopt me as her goddaughter."

Michael's smile froze. "I don’t agree!"

"Your objection is irrelevant," Lucy rolled her eyes. "From now on, you’re my godbrother."

"Who wants to be your brother?!" Michael gritted his teeth. "Are you really this cruel?"

Lucy raised a brow. "Yep. Better start looking for a godsister-in-law for me."

"Lucy!" Michael's eyes reddened with anger. "Do you have to twist the knife in my heart?"

"Isn’t it better to face reality early?" She picked up the machete from the ground and walked away without looking back.

Michael watched her retreating figure, his chest tight with pain.

A godsister? He’d rather die.

But he knew this was Lucy’s biggest concession. At least... she was willing to acknowledge him now.

Meanwhile, when Lucy returned to camp, Lily still hadn’t come back.

It wasn’t until everyone finished packing their sleeping bags that Daniel Miller noticed something amiss. "Why is Teacher Lily taking so long?"

Victor Stone replied calmly, "We’ve already sent people to look for her."

Twenty minutes later, a blond mercenary brought back a disheveled Lily.

Lucy glanced up—and her pupils contracted sharply.

The golden aura around Lily was even brighter than before!
###Chapter 76: Brutal Banter

Morning dew still clung to the grass blades when Lucy White opened her eyes.

She quietly pulled out a talisman and tapped it lightly with her fingertips. A faint glow flashed before the paper turned to ashes, scattering in the dawn breeze.

"Up so early, Lucy?" The cameraman yawned as he powered on his equipment.

Lucy set a pot over the makeshift stove. "Just boiling some bird eggs for breakfast."

With practiced ease, she started a fire, watching a dozen small eggs roll in the bubbling water.

"I'm going to wash up." She dusted off her hands and stood.

Ethan Smith appeared behind her without warning. "Mind if I join?"

He wore a light gray T-shirt that made his fair skin glow. In the morning light, his handsome features seemed gilded.

"Me too!" Michael Johnson emerged from his tent, hair tousled, dark circles stark under his eyes.

Lucy gave him a glance. "Suit yourself."

The three walked along the path toward the river. Michael deliberately wedged himself between them, turning to Ethan. "Such a disciplined routine, Mr. Smith. No wonder you're the veteran."

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Young people should take better care of themselves. Those dark circles—rough night?"

Michael stiffened. "These are natural eye bags!"

"Oh?" Ethan raised a brow. "Quite pronounced ones, then."

Lucy couldn't help but snort a laugh.

Michael immediately pouted at her. "Lucy, be honest—who looks younger between us?"

Ethan watched with amused interest.

Lucy tilted her head, studying them. Ethan's complexion was radiant, while Michael looked haggard from sleepless nights.

"Mr. Smith is two years older than you," she paused, "but he's definitely aging better."

Michael clutched his chest as if struck by lightning, staggering back two steps.

Ethan's eyes glinted with satisfaction. "Thanks for the compliment."

[Live comments exploded:]
"I'm dying! Michael just got roasted!"
"Ethan's clapback was lethal!"
"Lucy spitting facts! Ethan's skin is unreal."
"Michael.exe has stopped functioning."
"I could watch these three bicker forever."
"Ethan being sassy is adorable."
"Someone get Michael an eye mask."
"Michael, hydrate and sleep, please."

Michael gloomily pulled out his phone to check his reflection, muttering, "Is it that bad...?"

Lucy handed him a damp towel, barely suppressing a grin. "Here. Freshen up."

At the riverside, the clear water mirrored the morning light. Ethan crouched, trailing his fingers through the stream.

"Nice weather today," he said to Lucy. "Race you to spot the first fish?"

Michael cut in, "I'm playing too!"

Lucy watched their childish rivalry, struck by how perfect the morning felt. Sunlight dappled her face through the leaves as she smiled. "Fine. Loser cooks the catch."

A breeze carried their laughter downstream.
###Chapter 77: Omen in the Sky

Morning dew still clung to the leaves as the trio made their way to the stream to freshen up.

Lucy White cupped a handful of clear water and splashed it onto her face. Crystal droplets trickled down her fair cheeks. She pulled out a small porcelain vial from her pocket, tipping a few drops of homemade toner onto her palms before patting it gently onto her skin. In this perilous rainforest, any unnecessary cosmetics were nothing but a burden.

On their way back, Lucy seized a blind spot in the camera’s view and swiftly slipped a yellow talisman into Michael Johnson’s hand. "Take this—a calming talisman," she murmured under her breath. "It should help shield you from that voice."

Michael’s fingers trembled slightly as he tucked the charm into his inner pocket. "Thanks," he replied, his voice carrying a gentleness she hadn’t heard in a long time.

Lucy glanced at the suddenly well-behaved man, a mix of emotions swirling inside her. If only he’d been like this sooner… She shook her head and quickened her pace to put distance between them. "Take care of yourself."

The exchange didn’t escape Ethan Smith’s notice. His deep eyes flickered, the corner of his lips lifting almost imperceptibly.

By the time they returned to camp, the others were just waking up. The enticing aroma of boiled bird eggs Lucy had prepared drew cheers from her team as they eagerly gathered around.

"Lucy, you’re amazing!" Ryan Clark cradled the warm eggs in his hands, shooting a smug look at the other teams.

The trainees watched enviously, some muttering under their breath, "We should’ve picked Lucy as our mentor..."

When Hank Cooper blew the assembly whistle, several female celebrities were still holed up in their tents applying makeup. Victor Stone frowned at their meticulously done faces but held his tongue.

As they ventured deeper into the rainforest, danger struck relentlessly. A python as thick as a bowl suddenly dropped from the treetops, sending the group into a frenzy of screams. Hank swiftly neutralized the threat, but Olivia Davis grew increasingly pale.

"Are you okay?" Lucy immediately noticed her distress, steadying the swaying girl with a firm yet gentle grip.

Olivia bit her lip and nodded, beads of sweat forming at her temples. "It just… came on suddenly..."

Without hesitation, Lucy took her backpack, her movements decisive. "I’ve got you." She leaned closer, whispering, "Is the pain bad?"

At Olivia’s confirming nod, Lucy’s eyes softened with sympathy. During the next break, she gathered a handful of medicinal herbs and brewed them into a dark-brown concoction.

"Drink this. It’ll help," she said, handing Olivia a warm bamboo cup.

The remedy worked better than expected. By the time they resumed their trek, Olivia could walk on her own, though Lucy still insisted on supporting her.

"Lucy’s so attentive."
"I wouldn’t have even noticed."
The hushed praises from the team reached Lily Green’s ears. She scoffed and quickened her steps to sidle up to Michael.

At noon, Hank’s team managed to hunt a few wild rabbits. The trainees fumbled through preparing the meat, and the end result was barely passable.

"Eat as much as you can," Lucy urged her team, forcing down a bite of charred rabbit without flinching. Ethan sat beside her, eating just as dutifully.

Michael watched Lucy’s profile, suddenly remembering the braised pork ribs she used to make. Silently, he set aside his energy bar and forced himself to eat more of the roasted rabbit.

The afternoon trek went surprisingly smoothly. Olivia had regained some energy and chatted cheerfully with Lucy.

"That medicine of yours is incredible," she said, rubbing her no-longer-cramping abdomen. "Works better than painkillers."

Lucy was about to reply when she abruptly looked up at the sky. A few wispy clouds were gathering at an unnatural speed against the clear blue.

"It’s going to rain," she said, striding toward the team leader. "We need to find shelter, fast."

Hank squinted skeptically. "Doesn’t look like rain to me."

"Within the hour," Lucy stated firmly. "And it’ll last a long time."

The group exchanged uneasy glances. Under the vast, cloudless sky, her prediction seemed absurd.

Could they… really trust her?
###Chapter 78: Seriously?

Lucy White remained unfazed by the skeptical glances from the group. Some things were simply beyond explanation.

She shrugged at Hank Cooper. "I used a special method to predict this. Believe it or not, it's up to you."

Hank pondered briefly. "Alright, we'll trust you. Let's find a cave to shelter from the rain."

Since Lucy suggested it, they might as well try. There was nothing to lose if they couldn't find a cave.

The exhausted group raised no objections.

After thirty minutes of hiking with no cave in sight, everyone was panting heavily.

Lily Green suddenly spoke with a sweet smile. "Ms. White, since you can predict things, why not divine where the cave is? I'm sure you can do it."

Her intention was clearly to put Lucy on the spot.

The group exchanged uneasy glances. Locating a cave was far more challenging than predicting weather—this was obviously a setup.

The audience held their breath, eager to see how Lucy would respond.

Lucy saw right through Lily's scheme. She could have refused, but she refused to give the satisfaction.

"Fine." Calmly, she pulled three ancient divination coins from her pocket. "Let me cast a reading."

The coins clinked crisply as she tossed them in her palm.

"Northeast direction. There's a sheltering cave." Lucy declared with certainty.

Everyone stared in disbelief. Seriously?

Hank and Victor Stone exchanged glances. This was beyond bizarre.

"Then we head northeast," Hank decided. It couldn't hurt to try.

Lily's lips curled. "I'm sure Ms. White's prediction is accurate."

Lucy scoffed. "That might be believable if you could wipe that smug look off your face."

Lily's smile froze. She hadn't expected Lucy to call her out so directly.

"Why are you targeting me like this? I genuinely believe in you," Lily said tearfully.

Lucy couldn't be bothered. "Say whatever you want. The results will disappoint you regardless." With that, she helped Olivia Davis forward.

Ethan Smith followed without hesitation. Pausing beside Lily, he remarked, "Your expressions are painfully transparent. Consider hiring an acting coach."

His words outright mocked her poor演技.

The audience suddenly understood—Lily had been performing all along.

Lily paled. "I wasn't—"

But Ethan had already walked away. Michael Johnson approached coldly. "Do you think everyone's stupid?"

Tears welled in Lily's eyes. "Why won't anyone believe me?"

Michael rolled his eyes. "Suit yourself," before catching up to Lucy.

The others exchanged awkward glances and hurried after them, leaving Lily alone wiping her tears.

Clenching her teeth in fury, she reluctantly followed the group, secretly marking trees along the way, her eyes flashing with venom.

Lucy observed this discreetly, frowning. Lily was definitely up to something.

Twenty minutes later, a cave materialized before them.

The entire group stood stunned.

Hank and Victor locked eyes in utter shock. This was downright miraculous!
###Chapter 79: Uncanny Prediction

The clear sky darkened abruptly, heavy clouds gathering at a visible pace.

"It's really going to rain!" Hank Cooper tilted his head to observe the rapidly shifting sky, his eyes flashing with astonishment.

He turned to Lucy White, his tone tinged with disbelief. "Your prediction is downright uncanny!"

Lucy's lips curved slightly. "I told you I had this ability."

"I believe you now!" Hank waved his hands emphatically. "From now on, I'll trust whatever you say."

"Let's pack up and head into the cave first." Lucy pointed toward the nearby cliffside.

Hank exchanged a glance with Victor Stone. "Wait here. We'll check it out first."

Wild caves often housed dangerous beasts, and they couldn’t afford to be careless.

"Be careful." Lucy swept a glance over their faces, confirming no ill omens.

Before long, the two men emerged, tossing several snakes far away.

"All clear. Come on in."

The cave was spacious and dry, easily accommodating the entire group.

No sooner had they settled in than the sound of pattering rain echoed outside, quickly escalating into a downpour.

Now, everyone looked at Lucy with newfound awe—this wasn’t luck, but genuine skill!

"Lucy, you’re amazing!" Daniel Miller sidled up, eyes sparkling.

Robert Lee nodded with a smile. "Color me impressed."

He silently congratulated himself for buying Lucy’s talisman earlier—it had been worth every penny.

"Ms. White is incredible!"
"A real oracle!"
The other participants chimed in with praise.

Lucy waved them off. "Keep this up, and I might get a big head."

Lily Green dug her nails into her palms, seething. She had hoped to see Lucy humiliated, only to watch her steal the spotlight instead!

As the rain intensified, the group gathered to chat.

Robert couldn’t resist asking, "Was that the I Ching divination you used earlier?"

"Just a minor locating technique." Lucy shook her head. "The I Ching is more complex."

"So you can perform I Ching divination?" Robert’s eyes lit up.

"I can."

"Are there any taboos around it?" Robert probed cautiously.

Lucy understood his meaning. "Fortune-telling shouldn’t be discussed openly."

Robert exhaled in relief. "Then… could I book a session?"

"I have two slots left this month." Lucy agreed readily. "After the show wraps, I’ll read yours."

"Perfect!" Robert beamed.

Hank immediately cut in. "Save the other slot for me? I know the rules."

Having always held metaphysics in reverence, he wasn’t about to miss this chance with a true master.

"Deal." Lucy nodded.

Seeing their success, Daniel joined in. "Can I book one for next month?"

"We’ll talk next month." Lucy chuckled, then studied his forehead for a moment. "Daniel, be careful these next two days—you might face an impending disaster."

Daniel’s smile froze. "Can it be avoided?"

"Just stay away from hillsides." Lucy reassured him. "It’s not serious."

Daniel let out a long breath. "I’ll be extra careful!"

The rain persisted until nightfall, leaving everyone famished.

Just as they worried about dinner, Lucy pulled energy bars from her bag, sharing half with Olivia Davis.

Ethan Smith and the others also retrieved their rations, washing them down with morning dew they’d collected.

The rest of the group watched enviously, filled with regret—

"If only we’d listened to Lucy earlier!" Daniel groaned, clutching his growling stomach in despair.
###Chapter 80: Undercurrents of Danger

The energy bars were nearly gone for everyone. With so many people in the cave, no one dared to ask Lucy White and the others for more, though they watched with longing eyes.

Olivia Davis hesitated as she held the bar. "Lucy, you should keep this for yourself."

Lucy pushed it into her hands. "I have more in my bag. You're not feeling well—how are you going to keep up tomorrow if you don't eat?"

Olivia's eyes grew warm. It was the first time a girl had taken care of her like this. She nibbled on the bar, her voice barely audible. "Thank you."

Lucy smiled at the faint blush on Olivia's ears.

In her past life, after leaving the show, Olivia had become nothing more than a stepping stone for Lily Green. Not only had she been overshadowed, but she'd also been labeled as "pretentious" and "fake." A single mistake during the final live performance had dragged her entire team down, earning her endless hate from netizens.

Lucy had always liked this quiet, introverted girl. As fellow women, it was only natural to look out for each other.

"Mm." Olivia tucked the gratitude away in her heart. If not for Lucy's intervention, she wouldn’t have dared to admit she was suffering from cramps. Had she slowed the team down, the backlash would have been brutal.

Hank Cooper and Victor Stone still had plenty of energy bars left after sharing the grilled fish yesterday. They’d expected babysitting these celebrities to be a nightmare, but surprisingly, things had gone smoothly.

What they didn’t know was that most of the group was barely holding on. Only because Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson hadn’t complained did the others grit their teeth and endure.

As Lucy and the others finished eating, the rest of the group lay in their sleeping bags, stomachs growling, willing sleep to come faster.

Once the cameras shut off, darkness swallowed the cave.

At two in the morning, Lucy's eyes snapped open. She slipped silently out of her sleeping bag and crept toward the cave entrance.

In the shadows, three pairs of eyes opened simultaneously.

Hank and Victor, trained for fieldwork, never slept deeply outdoors. Ethan, on the other hand, was instinctively alert.

He narrowed his eyes at the exit—that slender silhouette was unmistakably Lucy.

The three assumed she was stepping out for a private moment, but when ten minutes passed without her return, Ethan was the first to rise and follow.

Victor kept his voice low. "I'll check. You stay."

Hank nodded. "Be careful."

Outside, Ethan swept his flashlight across the damp ground. A trail of footprints led deep into the dense forest.

"Lucy!" he called in a hushed voice.

The sound of a scuffle echoed in the distance. His pulse spiked, and he broke into a run.

Under the beam of his flashlight, three burly men were closing in on Lucy, their movements sharp and lethal—clearly trained fighters.

Ethan and Victor, who had just arrived, immediately joined the fray.

"Fall back!" one of the attackers barked. In an instant, the three scattered into the jungle with startling speed.

"Are you hurt?" Ethan grabbed Lucy's wrist.

She shook her head. "I heard noises and came to check. They were lurking around."

Ethan's frown deepened. "Next time, call for backup first. That was reckless."

Victor studied the trampled ground. "They were speaking an indigenous dialect."

"Not from our country," Lucy confirmed. "And they smelled of blood."

Ethan turned to Victor. "Did the production crew set this up?"

Victor tried contacting the director, but the comms remained dead.

"Something's wrong," Lucy said grimly. "Those men had the aura of killers."

The three exchanged glances before silently returning to the cave.

Victor roused Hank and the three other mercenaries, and they conferred in low voices.

Lucy and Ethan settled back into their sleeping bags.

Tomorrow, trouble was coming.
###Chapter 81: Things Just Got Serious

The first rays of morning light had just crept into the cave when Lucy White opened her eyes.

She tiptoed out of the entrance, careful not to wake the others still asleep. Last night's incident had forced her to change plans—she was supposed to gather everyone to search for food, but now she had to go alone.

A branch snapped under her foot with a sharp crack.

"Leaving so early?" Ethan Smith's deep voice came from behind her.

Lucy turned to see him leaning against the cave entrance, the dawn light casting a golden halo around him.

"Yeah. Wanted to give everyone more rest." She kept her voice low. "Today might be... complicated."

Ethan closed the distance between them in a few strides. "I'll come with you."

They walked side by side into the dense forest. Lucy noticed Ethan checking his phone periodically.

"No signal?" she asked.

He nodded. "Completely dead since last night."

A chill ran down Lucy's spine. If the production crew's satellite relay was malfunctioning, that wasn't a good sign. She pulled three divination coins from her pocket and tossed them lightly in her palm.

"The crew's alive, but in danger," she said, studying the hexagram.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. "Kidnapped, then."

"Most likely." Lucy pocketed the coins. "Those men weren't amateurs."

Ethan smirked. "Great location choice by the crew. 'Uninhabited island,' they said. Turns out we've got some very well-armed 'neighbors.'"

"They must have found a way to block satellite detection." Lucy kicked aside a loose stone. "Those three last night knew the terrain too well. They've been here a while."

They gathered wild berries and bird eggs in silence. Lucy's fingertips felt cold—in her past life, this episode had been filmed domestically. Why was everything different now?

"What do you think they are?" Ethan asked suddenly.

Lucy looked up. "Trained, well-equipped... probably pirates."

When they returned to the cave, Hank Cooper was waiting under a tree. He gave them a meaningful look.

"Couldn't reach the crew?" Lucy cut straight to the point.

Hank raised an eyebrow. "How'd you know?"

"Divination." She briefly explained the reading, then added, "The helicopter's probably compromised too."

Hank stroked his chin. "Two options. First, stick to the original plan and head for the extraction point. Second, try to rescue them."

"Second option," Lucy said without hesitation. "If they're after us, they won't let anyone leave easily."

She paused, lowering her voice further. "I think they want ransom."

A flicker of approval crossed Hank's eyes. "Same thought."

The three exchanged glances, the gravity of the situation settling over them. This wasn't a reality show anymore—it was a real survival game.

"Don't alert the others yet," Hank finally said. "We'll discuss details when Victor gets back."

Lucy nodded and turned to leave with the bag of food. Then she stopped and glanced back. "Ethan... are you scared?"

He gave her a faint smile. "Not with you here."

Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling them in shifting patterns, but it did nothing to dispel the shadow hanging over them.
###Chapter 82: Don't Worry, I'm Not That Stupid

Hank Cooper nodded thoughtfully.

"You're right. Let's go with the second plan."

His brow furrowed. "But most of these people are defenseless celebrities. Taking them on a rescue mission would be suicide."

Lucy White had already considered this. "The three mercenaries can stay behind to protect everyone. Ethan and I will go with you."

"Just the four of us?" Hank lowered his voice. "The kidnappers probably have guns."

Lucy smirked. "Don’t forget what I do."

"Aren’t you just a celebrity?" Hank looked baffled. Did she have some secret identity?

"I'm also a metaphysician." She winked. "Using metaphysical arts, fewer people means better stealth."

Ethan Smith volunteered, and Lucy, having seen his skills firsthand, agreed immediately.

"Fine." Hank made up his mind. "We won’t tell the others?"

"Right. No need to cause panic," Lucy agreed.

Suddenly, she asked, "The livestream signal is down?"

Hank sighed. "We lost connection this morning. Even the backup transmitter failed."

"There must be a signal jammer on the island," he added.

Lucy had an idea. "I’ll restore the livestream. You guys figure out how to send a distress signal."

"That way, the kidnappers won’t get suspicious," she explained.

Hank’s eyes widened. "You can bypass a jammer?"

"Piece of cake," Lucy said confidently.

Hank stared. "..."

"Restoring the livestream would be ideal," he hesitated. "But the four of us won’t be on camera..."

"Just say the signal is unstable and only one camera is working. We’ll make an excuse about looking for food," Lucy had it all planned.

"Brilliant!" Hank gave her a thumbs-up.

Just then, Michael Johnson approached.

"What’s going on?" he asked sharply.

Lucy quickly filled him in.

"That’s just our luck!" Michael was stunned. "I’m coming with you."

"No," Lucy refused. "You have a more important job."

"What job?"

"Keep the others occupied with the livestream. Make some noise," she said with a cryptic smile.

Michael frowned. "I don’t like leaving you alone."

"Listen to me or not?" Lucy glared.

"I’ve gotten stronger. I can handle myself," she added.

Michael reluctantly gave in. "Fine. How do I cause trouble?"

Lucy lowered her voice. "Make things difficult for Lily Green. Ideally, get her hurt."

"Just her?" Michael was surprised.

"Having second thoughts?" Lucy raised a brow.

"Of course not!" Michael denied quickly. "I just don’t get why her."

Ever since wearing Lucy’s talisman, he hadn’t been controlled by that strange force again.

Lucy explained, "I noticed she left markings yesterday, exposing our location."

"She’s working with the kidnappers?" Michael was shocked.

Hank’s expression darkened. "Traitorous bitch!"

Ethan stood calmly to the side, clearly already aware.

"We don’t have all the facts yet. No need to tip them off," Lucy reasoned. "Just keep her distracted."

Michael nodded. "Got it."

The affection in his tone made Hank glance between them curiously.

"Make it look like an accident," Lucy reminded. "Don’t let her contact the kidnappers again."

She didn’t want Michael slipping back into his old ways.

"Don’t worry, I’m not that stupid," Michael said, sounding wounded.

As the others emerged from the cave, Lucy approached the cameraman.

"Let me try restoring the livestream."

The cameraman skeptically stepped aside. "Go ahead."

He didn’t think a celebrity could fix professional equipment.
###Chapter 83: Doesn't Concern You

Lucy White took the laptop from the cameraman and walked to the corner of the cave. Her slender fingers flew across the keyboard, the blue glow of the screen reflecting on her delicate profile.

Lily Green's eyes flickered with curiosity, but before she could approach, Michael Johnson blocked her path.

"Don't disturb her," Michael said coldly.

Lily bit her lip. "I just wanted to see if I could help."

"You can't," he replied bluntly. "Staying away is the best help you can offer."

Her eyes reddened. "Michael, that night—I didn’t mean to leave you—"

"Shut up." He stepped closer, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Call me 'Michael' again, and I’ll make sure you never work in this industry again."

Lily stumbled back, stunned. This wasn’t how she’d imagined things would go.

"Get out," Michael ordered.

With one last resentful glance at Lucy’s back, Lily stomped away, fuming inwardly. That bitch Lucy—even after their breakup, she’s still got Michael wrapped around her finger!

Silence settled back into the cave. Michael sat across from Lucy, watching her intently.

She was always like this when she worked—lashes lowered, lips slightly pursed, radiating an effortless allure. It struck him then that he hadn’t truly looked at her in a long time.

When had that changed? Probably when his family started pressuring him to marry, and he’d pushed her away, treating her horribly in the process. Looking back now, it was beyond stupid.

With a soft click, Lucy shut the laptop.

"Done," she announced, meeting his complicated gaze. "What are you staring at?"

"You’re beautiful," he blurted out.

Lucy arched a brow. "Did you take the wrong pills today?"

In his memory, he’d never given her a single compliment—always mocking her first before offering help.

"I mean it," Michael said, unusually sincere. "You’ve always been beautiful."

She scoffed. "Doesn’t concern you."

Standing, she went to check the equipment with the cameraman, leaving Michael behind, his expression dimming.

"Ms. White, you’re amazing!" The young cameraman, Noah Adams, gushed in admiration. "You actually fixed the signal!"

Lucy grinned and ruffled his hair. "Piece of cake."

Noah flushed instantly, drawing envious looks from the rest of the crew.

The livestream resumed, and though only one camera was working, the audience was thrilled.

[Finally, it’s back!]
[Lucy looks gorgeous!]
[More shots of Ethan, please!]
[Michael’s so handsome today!]

Comments flooded the screen, everyone overjoyed to see their favorites again.
###Chapter 84: Unexpected Discovery

The moment the livestream flickered back to life, the tension in the air dissipated among the team leaders.

"Can we restore the signal?" Hank Cooper whispered to Lucy White.

Lucy shook her head. "The production crew's mobile relay is under their control. Our equipment can only sustain the livestream." She tapped her phone screen lightly. "Unless we find their signal jammer."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Hank's eyes, but he quickly regained his composure. "At least we still have the livestream."

On camera, Hank and Victor Stone subtly flashed a series of hand signals—exclusive codes used by their special ops unit. They couldn’t risk an overt SOS, not with the kidnappers watching. But they trusted their comrades monitoring the stream would understand.

The live comments exploded:

[Where’s Lucy? Show us Lucy!]

[Ethan’s not working today?]

[The production team is ruthless!]

Daniel Miller rubbed his growling stomach. "Hank, can we go find some food?"

"Split into teams," Hank said with a grin. "Two groups will cover more ground."

"I want to be with Lucy!" Daniel immediately raised his hand.

The other guests chimed in, "Us too!"

Ethan Smith smirked. "Sorry, but we’re already a team."

Daniel smacked his forehead. "Forgot about that!"

Hank shrugged. "The director specifically said you all need to experience real island survival." He gestured toward the three approaching team leaders. "So they’ll be guiding you."

Groans erupted. "The director is brutal!"

The comments flooded with [Director is heartless!]

As they were forcibly separated, Robert Lee protested, "Why does Ethan get to stay with Lucy?"

Ethan replied coolly, "I took the day off."

Silence.

Top-tier celebrities really did whatever they wanted.

Once out of livestream range, Hank lowered his voice. "Follow the footprints?"

Lucy shook her head. "No need. I marked them." Her fingers brushed the divination compass, and the needle spun wildly before locking onto a direction.

"Found them," Lucy murmured, eyes sharpening.

The trio followed the compass through dense foliage.

An hour later, the trees thinned—

Hidden cabins stood in a clearing, guarded by armed patrols.

Victor sucked in a breath. "This is their base."

Hank narrowed his eyes. "Now things get interesting."

Ethan suddenly gripped Lucy’s shoulder. "Someone’s coming."

The four ducked into the underbrush.

A familiar figure emerged from the main cabin—

A missing production assistant from the crew.

Lucy’s pupils constricted. "So there was a mole."

Hank’s hand hovered near his waist. "What now?"

"Wait," Lucy said firmly. "We move at nightfall."

The jungle burned crimson under the setting sun.

A silent battle was about to begin.
###Chapter 85: Unexpected Reunion

Hank Cooper and Victor Stone exchanged glances, both seeing shock reflected in each other's eyes.

Lucy White's tracking skills were nothing short of miraculous!

If they had used conventional reconnaissance methods, it would have taken far more time and effort—and risked alerting their targets.

Hank leaned closer to Lucy, lowering his voice. "Ever considered joining our special ops team? We offer excellent benefits."

The more he thought about it, the more appealing the idea became. She was practically a human GPS!

Lucy shook her head politely. "I have other plans."

Hank wasn’t ready to give up. "What about the Special Operations Division? My cousin works there—I can put in a word for you."

He quickly explained the division’s unique nature.

Lucy seemed thoughtful. "Let’s discuss it after the show wraps up."

Victor cleared his throat, reminding them this wasn’t the time for casual conversation.

"Seven patrols ahead, and at least twenty more inside the cabin," he said grimly. "Judging by their gear, they’re with the Black Horizon Syndicate."

Lucy’s breath hitched.

The Black Horizon Syndicate?

Wasn’t that the organization from the novel…?

Suppressing the turmoil inside, she feigned confusion. "Would they execute the hostages?"

Victor shook his head. "Not usually, as long as the ransom’s paid. But if the money doesn’t come through—"

Before he could finish, the cabin door swung open.

A gaunt old man emerged, flanked by attendants. The patrols immediately saluted. "Elder Malakar!"

The elder strode arrogantly toward the central cabin.

"Where’s your leader?" he demanded haughtily.

A guard hurried inside to announce him.

Moments later, a cold-faced man in black tactical gear stepped out.

Lucy’s pupils constricted.

Him?!

The man’s sharp features were like blades, his entire demeanor radiating hostility.

"What do you want?" His tone was icy.

Elder Malakar smirked. "I need fresh hosts for my new brood."

Seeing the man’s expression darken, he hastily added, "The celebrities on the island will do."

"This is the Syndicate’s order," he said meaningfully.

The man fell silent for a beat. "We move tonight."

As he turned away, his gaze flickered toward Lucy’s hiding spot.

She held her breath.

Did he… sense us?
###Chapter 86: She Knew Him

The sound of Hank Cooper's gritted teeth snapped Lucy White back to reality.

"That old man's attire and accent—he's definitely a blood mage from the southern isles," she whispered, keeping her voice low.

The knowledge of metaphysics she had learned from her father in her past life came rushing back. Though she had rarely dealt with such matters since entering the entertainment industry, those memories had never faded.

"A blood mage?" Hank and Victor Stone exchanged uneasy glances. "No wonder they're using live hosts for their brood."

Blood mages from the southern isles were divided into two factions—one followed strict moral codes, while the other reveled in wickedness. The one before them clearly belonged to the latter.

"How powerful is he?" Hank asked nervously.

Lucy narrowed her eyes. "His aura reeks of death. He’s taken many lives."

"Should we still try to rescue them?"

"Originally, we could've used sedatives, but with him here, it’s complicated." Lucy frowned. Since her rebirth, she had been busy with show recordings and had little time for cultivation. Worse, she lacked proper tools.

Then, an idea struck her. "Find me some animal bones. I’ll set up a formation."

"Got it!" The three of them immediately split up.

Thanks to her familiarity with the forest, Lucy soon returned with an armful of bones. With a cinnabar brush, she traced intricate sigils onto them.

When Ethan Smith returned, he dragged behind him a staggering number of bones.

"That fast?" Lucy arched a brow in surprise.

"Got lucky," Ethan replied with a light smile.

By the time Hank and Victor returned, panting, Lucy had already finished inscribing all the sigils.

"Rest up. I’ll go set the formation." With a compass in hand, she moved stealthily, burying the bones in seven strategic locations. The patrolling kidnappers remained oblivious.

"The formation needs seven hours to activate. We’ll move tonight," Lucy said upon her return.

"But the leader plans to take people tonight. What if they notice we’re missing?" Victor worried.

Lucy smirked. "Who said we’re running? Why not 'walk right into the trap'?"

"You mean..." Hank's eyes lit up.

"Pretend to be captured, then strike from within." Lucy nodded. "The rescue team will arrive by tonight at the latest. Perfect timing."

She had already calculated that the rescuers would arrive just after the kidnappers. It was a risk, but she was confident she could protect everyone.

"Alright!" Hank and Victor exchanged a glance and decided to trust her.

On their way back, the four pretended to be foraging for food.

"That leader looks Chinese, but I’ve never seen him on Black Horizon’s wanted list," Hank muttered.

Victor added, "For someone so young to rise to leadership—he’s no ordinary man."

A thought flickered in Lucy’s mind. "How many leaders does Black Horizon have?"

"By region. The former Asian leader was Chinese, but rumors say he’s recently dead," Victor explained. "The new leader is likely related by blood."

"What was the old leader’s name?" Lucy pressed.

"They all use codenames. No one knows their real identities."

Lucy nodded thoughtfully, though her mind was in turmoil. She knew that young leader—not just knew him, but had once saved his life.

One winter during high school, she had found a bloodied teenager curled up in an alley on her way home from school. The figure from that memory overlapped with the one she had just seen outside the cabin.

Ian Stone. So it’s you.
###Chapter 87: Is She a Walking Jinx?

Lucy White never expected to encounter Ian Stone here. What shocked her more was discovering he'd become one of the leaders of the Black Horizon Syndicate.

In her memories, Ian remained that scrawny, stubborn boy. Back in high school, she'd rescued him from bullies in an alleyway. From then on, he'd followed her like a shadow.

When she took taekwondo classes, he joined too. He'd endure every bruise during training without complaint. Within a year, he could spar with her evenly.

But when she skipped grades to enter university, Ian vanished without explanation.

He reappeared years later as a polished returnee, picking her up from campus in a luxury car. Dressed in tailored suits with refined manners, he bore no resemblance to the boy she remembered.

He started asking her out frequently, showering her with gifts. She declined every time—she was still dating Michael Johnson, and no argument would make her entertain other suitors.

After her suicide and rebirth, this new revelation about Ian's identity stunned her.

"Victor Stone... Ian Stone..." Lucy murmured, suddenly recalling the mysterious male lead from the novel.

In the book, Lily Green had rescued an injured man in a parking lot—the same man who later became her powerful patron. The timeline matched perfectly.

Yet the novel never mentioned Ian's pursuit of her. Lucy realized this world held far more complexity than the book portrayed. Every person had their own story beyond Lily's limited perspective.

Just like how the novel depicted Lily as Michael's unattainable first love—a complete fabrication from reality.

"Can't trust everything in books," Lucy massaged her temples.

The trio returned to their cave to rest before their nighttime operation.

Meanwhile, the foraging team ran into trouble.

"Professor Miller, let's pick those wild fruits!" Lily pointed excitedly at hillside trees.

Daniel Miller recalled Lucy's warning, a chill running down his spine. "Perhaps we should gather mushrooms instead?"

"Others are already collecting mushrooms." Lily dismissed his concern. "I'm good at climbing—I'll get them!"

Before Daniel could stop her, she'd scrambled up the tree.

From the crowd's rear, Michael flicked his fingers.

"Ah!" Lily shrieked as she tumbled from the branches.

Daniel instinctively reached to catch her but staggered backward from the impact.

"Watch out!" Robert Lee shouted.

Too late.

Daniel lost his footing and rolled down the slope.

"My arm!" He paled from pain.

The medic examined him and sighed in relief. "Dislocated. I'll reset it."

Daniel's agonized scream echoed through the valley.

Witnessing this, Robert remembered Lucy's prophecy. He gave Lily a meaningful side-eye, suspicion creeping in: Is this woman a walking jinx? Everyone around her seems cursed with misfortune.
###Chapter 88: Deflecting Blame

Daniel Miller gasped in pain, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"I told you I didn't want to go near the hillside!" He glared at Robert Lee through gritted teeth, voice thick with suppressed anger.

Robert shot Lily Green a disdainful look, which only fueled Daniel's irritation.

"This is all Lily's fault!" He suddenly pointed at the woman standing nearby. "I warned her the tree was too dangerous, but she had to show off and climb it anyway!"

Lily's face paled, her eyes instantly reddening.

"Professor Miller, I really didn't mean to..." Her voice trembled. "Something suddenly hit my hand—"

"Bullshit!" Daniel sneered. "Lucy warned us right in front of you. Stop playing innocent."

Lily clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Idiot! She cursed inwardly while maintaining a pitiful expression.

"I just wanted to pick fruit for everyone..."

"Enough!" Michael Johnson cut in sharply. "Let's get Daniel back first."

He crouched down, gesturing for Daniel to climb onto his back.

Lily bit her quivering lip, tears welling but not falling. The surrounding cast members eyed her with silent reproach, subtly stepping back.

[Deserved it! Serves her right!]
[Quit the innocent act—disgusting.]
[Marketing herself as a lucky charm? More like a jinx.]
[The producers should replace her next episode.]

The live comments exploded.

Back at the cave, Lucy White returned to find Michael carrying Daniel.

"Went to the hillside after all?" She arched a brow.

Daniel grimaced. "Lily's doing."

Understanding flashed across Lucy's face as she turned to gather herbs.

"I'll go with you," Ethan Smith immediately offered.

Michael stepped forward. "Me too."

The trio left in quick succession, leaving Daniel groaning in the cave.

"Lucy..." He stared at the entrance like a man awaiting salvation.

Meanwhile, Lily lurked behind a tree, viciously shredding leaves between her fingers.

"Lucy... This is all your fault..." A shadow of malice flickered in her eyes.
###Chapter 89: You'll Never Have Another Chance

Lucy White led the two men out of the cave to search for medicinal herbs.

"Did you find their hideout? Is the production crew alright?" Michael Johnson asked as they walked.

Lucy briefly explained the situation. "We'll move tonight."

"That's troublesome." Michael frowned.

"Be careful tonight. If there's a chance, help the others." Lucy knew his skills well.

Michael flashed a grin. "Whatever you say."

Lucy: "..."

She wasn’t used to this suddenly well-behaved version of Michael.

Ethan Smith glanced at Michael—this top-tier celebrity was growing bolder by the day.

"You were the one who made Lily Green fall from the tree, weren’t you?" Ethan asked abruptly.

Michael shot him a glare. He had been waiting for Lucy to praise him.

Seeing Lucy’s questioning look, he reluctantly admitted, "I hit her hand with a pebble."

"Didn’t expect her to lunge at Daniel and send him tumbling down the slope."

Lucy mused that the protagonist’s plot armor was indeed strong—everyone else suffered instead.

"Keep an eye on Daniel tonight," she said, noticing Michael’s guilt.

Michael nodded. "That’s what I was thinking."

They soon found the herbs, and Lucy’s sharp eyes caught sight of a wild chicken nearby.

"You two, go catch it," she directed, pointing.

The two men moved toward the target in perfect sync.

The moment they were out of Lucy’s sight, Michael lowered his voice. "Stay away from Lucy."

"Says who?" Ethan raised an eyebrow.

"Her boyfriend." Michael lifted his chin.

Ethan smirked. "Ex-boyfriend, you mean."

"How do you know that?" Michael stiffened.

"None of your business," Ethan replied coolly.

Michael narrowed his eyes. "What’s your angle with Lucy?"

"Not yours to ask."

"I’m going to win her back," Michael declared like a vow.

Ethan chuckled. "You’ll never have another chance."

Before Michael could retort, Ethan strode ahead.

"..." Michael gritted his teeth in frustration.

Ethan swiftly knocked out the chicken with a well-aimed pebble and carried it back triumphantly.

Michael, lagging behind, cursed under his breath—once again, this guy had stolen the spotlight.

"Ethan caught it?" Lucy saw right through them.

Ethan smiled. "Mhm. You’re sharp."

"He was just faster," Michael muttered defensively.

Lucy laughed. "Meaning Ethan’s better."

"Yeah, yeah, he’s so impressive," Michael huffed, stomping ahead.

Watching his sulking retreat, Lucy thought this was more like the Michael she knew.

He didn’t get far before regret kicked in.

Stopping, he turned with a pitiful look. "Hurry up, you two!"

Lucy sighed. "Coming."

Back at the cave, Lucy assigned them tasks—one to tend the fire for medicine, the other for stewing the chicken.

As the others returned, they winced at Daniel’s pained state.

"Feeling any better, Daniel?" Robert Lee asked with concern.

"Waiting for Lucy’s remedy," Daniel said weakly.

"Need help?" Robert glanced at Lucy.

"No, it’s almost done." She focused on brewing the medicine.

Olivia Davis reassured, "Lucy’s potions work wonders. Mine stopped the pain right away last time."

Daniel nodded. "I trust her."

When they heard Lucy had even asked Ethan to hunt a chicken to nourish Daniel, everyone praised her thoughtfulness.

Lily, standing at the cave entrance, looked livid.

She hadn’t meant to hurt anyone, yet they all blamed her. Meanwhile, Lucy merely boiled some herbs and was suddenly a saint.

Worst of all, both Ethan and Michael orbited around Lucy like satellites.

Noticing Lily’s hostility, Lucy flashed her a taunting smile in a camera blind spot.

Lily trembled with rage before storming out.

Thinking of the men on the island, a vicious glint flashed in her eyes.

"You brought this on yourself, Lucy," she hissed.

Making sure no one was around, she pulled a wooden whistle from her pocket.

Unbeknownst to her, Hank Cooper watched everything from the nearby bushes.
###Chapter 90: An Unexpected Discovery

Deep in the woods, a tall figure stepped slowly through the fallen leaves.

Lily Green's eyes brightened, and she fluttered into the man's arms like a butterfly.

"Ian!" she cooed.

The man's slender fingers tangled in her hair as his lips brushed her ear. "In such a hurry to see me?"

Lily playfully thumped his chest. "You're terrible!"

Hidden in the undergrowth, Hank Cooper held his breath.

Just as he reached for his phone, Ian Stone's sharp gaze swept over him.

Hank immediately shut his eyes, pretending to be asleep.

No wonder he's the leader of Black Horizon Syndicate—his instincts are razor-sharp.

Ian turned his attention back to Lily, tilting her chin. "What's wrong?"

Her eyes instantly welled up. "Someone's bullying me."

"Oh?" Ian arched an amused brow. "Who dares?"

"That Lucy White!" Lily hissed through gritted teeth. "She's been targeting me at every turn. Today, she humiliated me in front of everyone."

She traced circles on his chest. "You wouldn't let me suffer like this, would you?"

Ian chuckled darkly. "I'll take care of her tonight."

Lily beamed and pressed a kiss to his lips. "I knew you'd protect me."

His gaze darkened as he pinned her against a tree...

Hank squeezed his eyes shut, inwardly groaning. This is too much.

Who would’ve thought Lily and the Black Horizon leader had this kind of relationship?

And the audacity—accusing Lucy of bullying her?

Half an hour later, Ian straightened his collar. "Coordinate with my men tonight."

Lily nodded obediently. "I'll be waiting."

Once he was gone, she smoothed her dress and hurried off.

Only then did Hank open his eyes.

Strange... Ian feels different from last time.

He shook his head. Probably overthinking it.

Back at the cave, Lucy was brewing medicine.

Daniel Miller already looked much better. "Lucy, this stuff is miraculous!"

She stirred the thick liquid. "I'll make you a medicinal charm later."

"A medicinal charm?" Daniel gaped.

The others exchanged stunned glances.

Hank returned just in time, whispering to Victor Stone, "What's she doing?"

"Drawing a talisman with medicine," Victor murmured. "Supposedly, it works just like drinking it."

Hank's jaw dropped. "That's possible?"

The two men locked eyes, excitement flashing between them.

If this could be used on missions...

Lucy finished the charm and handed it to Daniel. "Keep it close. Three days, and you'll recover."

He accepted it solemnly. "Thank you."

Though he'd never heard of such a thing, after experiencing her remedies firsthand, he trusted her.

The group remained skeptical but couldn't help anticipating the charm's effects.
###Chapter 91: The Miraculous Talismans

The livestream chat exploded in an instant.

[Medicinal charm? Is this for real?]
[No way, this is straight out of fantasy!]
[Look at Daniel’s face—he’s already recovering! The effect is instant!]

Then, a bold message flashed across the screen:
[I’m a med student. After sharing the academic charm, I jumped from the bottom to the top ten in finals!]

Like a floodgate opening, the chat went wild.

[Same! I actually passed physics for once!]
[I aced my math exam!]
[I got every English listening question right!]

Out of three thousand who shared the charm, over two thousand came forward with proof—some posting before-and-after grades, others their rank improvements. The most shocking was a chronic failure who somehow landed in the top fifty.

[Where are the haters now? Cat got your tongue?]
[LOL, bet they secretly shared it too!]

Meanwhile, in a luxury apartment, Liam Parker hurled his phone against the wall. "Useless idiots! Can’t even trash-talk when paid!"

Back in the livestream, the mood had shifted entirely.

[Lucy, please share more charms!]
[I need a love charm!]
[Give us a wealth charm!]
[A weight-loss charm, please!]

The chat became a unified plea: Thousands beg for talismans!

Deep in the island’s wilderness, at the Black Horizon Syndicate’s base, Ian Stone stared at his screen, fingertips brushing Lucy’s profile picture.

"What’s got you so captivated?" a teasing voice came from behind.

Ian instantly locked his phone, gaze sharp. "Mind your own business."

Elsewhere in the forest, the mouth of a cave wafted with savory aromas. Lucy was teaching her students how to prepare ingredients when Hank Cooper signaled her outside.

In private, Hank lowered his voice. "Lily Green just met with a man named Ian Stone."

Lucy arched a brow. "Oh?"

"They seemed… close," Hank said with a meaningful look. "And she’s egging him on to cause trouble for you."

Lucy smirked. "Noted."

Back inside, the students devoured their meal around the campfire.

"This is amazing!"
"Way better than yesterday!"

After eating, someone asked, "Are we moving out today?"

Hank glanced at Daniel. "Special circumstances. We’re staying the night."

As darkness fell, the production crew cut the livestream, citing signal issues.

Lily fidgeted, her eyes darting toward the cave entrance.

Clap! Hank suddenly silenced the group.

Footsteps echoed faintly outside.

Everyone tensed.

"Could it be the crew?" someone whispered.

Hank’s voice was grim. "Stay alert. This isn’t friendly."

In the shadows, Lucy tightened her grip on the talisman hidden in her sleeve.
###Chapter 92: The Brave Beauty

The clatter of gleaming knives hitting the ground echoed through the cave.

The atmosphere froze instantly.

"Don't move!" A dozen armed men in black stormed in, their gun barrels trained on everyone present.

The blond team leader opened his mouth to speak, but the cold muzzle of a pistol pressed against his temple.

"Ah—" Several female guests screamed in terror.

"Shut up!" The lead gunman barked. "One more sound and you're meeting your maker!"

The screams died abruptly.

Victor Stone's hand crept toward his waist, but his companion stopped him. Twenty armed thugs, including machine gunners—fighting back was too risky.

"Listen," the leader said in broken English. "We're Black Horizon Syndicate. Pay up, and you walk out alive."

"Black Horizon?" Someone gasped.

Hank Cooper whispered an explanation: "A criminal group that specializes in kidnapping the wealthy."

Beside Lucy White, Michael Johnson's muscles tensed. She gave his hand a reassuring pat.

"Stay calm, everyone," Lucy said firmly. "They just want money."

Strangely, her words seemed to soothe the group's frayed nerves.

The leader studied Lucy with interest. "The little lady's got guts."

A few mocking whistles followed.

Ethan Smith's gaze turned glacial.

"If you want ransom, treat us with respect," Lucy said evenly, meeting the man's eyes.

"Feisty." The leader grinned. "Then you're coming with us. But—" He waved his gun. "No funny business."

"How are we supposed to walk with our hands tied in this darkness?" Lucy gestured to the injured Daniel Miller. "And someone needs to carry him."

The others murmured agreement.

After a moment, the leader nodded. "Fine. But anyone runs, they die."

Without hesitation, Michael hoisted Daniel onto his back.

"Thanks, man," Daniel muttered. He was grateful he'd listened to Lucy and kept his medicinal charm—without it, the pain would've been unbearable.

"Anytime," Michael said firmly.

Half an hour after their departure, a team of special forces stormed the cave.

"Too late!" The commander slammed his fist against the rock wall.

"Sir! We found clues!"

A soldier handed over crumpled notes and a hand-drawn map. Scrawled words like "Black Horizon Syndicate" and "inside job" stood out.

"Move out!" the commander ordered. "Stay covert!"

But as they exited the cave, their navigation devices suddenly failed.

"At least we've got footprints to follow," the technician muttered, wiping sweat from his brow.

Under the ink-black sky, a perilous rescue mission began in silence...
###Chapter 93: The Secret Behind the Mask

"Commander, the signal interference is too strong!" The technician wiped sweat from his brow as he frantically adjusted the equipment. "This island must have military-grade jammers."

The commander slammed his fist against a tree trunk. "Damn it!"

He remembered the special orders from his superiors before the mission: "Ethan Smith's identity is highly sensitive. Ensure his safety at all costs."

"Move faster!" the commander barked. "We have to find the hostages before nightfall!"

The team exchanged uneasy glances. Everyone knew how brutal the Black Horizon Syndicate could be.

"At least the hostages are still alive," the deputy commander said, trying to reassure them. "They won't kill them outright."

Meanwhile, the director huddled in the corner of the wooden cabin, sick with regret. He never imagined his carefully planned Island Survival show would turn into a real-life fight for survival.

The door creaked open.

Lucy White and the others were shoved inside.

"You too—?" The director paled.

Robert Lee smirked bitterly. "Thanks to you, this is turning out to be quite the adventure."

William Jones cursed outright. "You picked a fantastic spot!"

Lucy scanned the room, her gaze lingering for a second on Lily Green, who was trembling in the corner.

"Arguing won't help," she said softly. "Conserving our energy is what matters."

Her calm voice had an inexplicably soothing effect, and the group fell silent.

The door swung open again.

A burly middle-aged man pointed at Lucy. "You. Come with me."

Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson immediately stepped in front of her.

"You want to take her?" Ethan's voice was ice. "You go through me first."

The man pulled out a pistol. "Move."

Lucy tugged lightly on their sleeves and whispered, barely audible, "Opportunity."

Ethan gave a barely perceptible nod. "Be careful."

Michael reluctantly stepped aside. "If anything happens, scream. We’ll come for you."

Lucy followed the man to the central cabin. When she stepped inside, her breath caught.

A masked man sat at the table, his long fingers tapping rhythmically against the wood.

"Sit," he said, his voice deep and cold.

Lucy feigned wariness. "Who are you? Why call me here alone?"

The corner of his mouth twitched beneath the mask. "I hear you're skilled in metaphysics?"

"I know a little," she replied carefully.

Suddenly, he leaned forward, and Lucy caught a faint scent of cedar—the same cologne Ian Stone had favored in high school.

"You're... different," he murmured, his tone unexpectedly gentle. "That's why I want to help you."

Her pulse quickened. His eyes—they matched the boy she remembered.

"Help me?" She pretended confusion. "What do you mean?"

He stood and walked to the window. "Rescue is coming in two days. When it does, leave with them."

Lucy studied his back. "Do I know you?"

He stiffened slightly before turning, his demeanor cold again. "No. I just respect talent."

But Lucy noticed the way his right hand absently brushed his left arm—exactly where Ian's birthmark had been.

A terrifying thought struck her: Was this man really Ian Stone?


###Chapter 94: Truth or Illusion

Lucy White's gaze was as sharp as a blade, piercing straight into Ian Stone. His thin lips were pressed tightly together, his eyes flickering with uncertainty.

"Ding—" The sudden ring of a phone shattered the silence.

Ian answered the call, his voice low. "Stay put. Don’t go anywhere." Without waiting for her response, he hurried out.

The wooden door slammed shut. Lucy paced to the window—the guards outside remained motionless. Her fingers tapped lightly against the tabletop, lost in thought.

Half an hour later, the door creaked open again.

A man in white entered alongside a gaunt old man. Behind the mask, the stranger’s eyes—identical to Ian’s—studied her with amusement.

"Quite the bold one," the man chuckled.

Lucy’s pupils contracted. That face, that voice—it was unmistakably Ian. Yet the flippant glint in his eyes and his careless demeanor were nothing like the man she remembered.

The old man’s murky gaze suddenly sharpened. "Marvelous!"

He bared his yellowed teeth in a grin. "Girl, wouldn’t you like to be even more beautiful?"

Lucy scoffed. "I’m already devastating enough."

"How about learning blood magic, then?" The old man pressed. "Make those who betray you beg for mercy—"

"Pass," Lucy cut him off. "Your face is advertisement enough for its side effects."

The old man’s expression darkened.

The masked man crossed his legs, his lips curling beneath the disguise.

"Clever tongue," the old man hissed. "Pity..."

His cane struck the floor with a thud, and eerie chanting filled the air. From the cracks in the wooden planks, centipedes and venomous snakes slithered forth, their rustling sending chills down the spine.

Lucy didn’t flinch. Her fingers twitched.

"Attack!" the old man barked.

The swarm surged toward her. With a flick of her wrist, three talismans ignited midair, landing in a perfect circle around her.

"Crack—"

Flames roared to life, twisting the creatures into charred husks. The stench of burning chitin filled the room as the old man howled, staggering back. "My treasures!"

He lunged in a frenzy, only for Lucy to sidestep and kick him across the room.

In the same breath, she pivoted toward the masked man. Her fist shot out—swift, ruthless. He barely blocked in time.

Ten exchanges later, Lucy’s eyes narrowed. His fighting style was bizarre, completely unlike anything she’d seen before.

"Thud!"

A spinning kick forced him back. Lucy darted past the threshold into the night. "Now!"

Before the guards could react, she vanished into the shadows.

The old man scrambled after her, biting his finger to draw a bloody sigil in the air. "I’ll make you wish you were dead!"

Meanwhile—

"Crash!" The neighboring door burst open. Hank Cooper and Victor Stone led their team out—only to freeze at the sight before them.

A blood-red moon hung overhead as countless shadowy figures clawed their way up from the earth...
###Chapter 95: Unbelievable Skills

Elder Malakar's bony fingers traced eerie arcs in the air as clusters of ghostly green flames materialized, drifting toward Lucy White like spectral harbingers of death.

A rustling sound erupted from the ground as countless venomous insects emerged from the soil, swarming toward Lucy in a writhing mass.

"Oh my God! What is that?"
"Lucy, watch out!"
"Holy crap, this is terrifying!"

Michael Johnson's pupils constricted, and he lunged forward, ready to charge down the steps.

"Don't move." Ethan Smith's grip clamped around his wrist like iron.

"Let go!" Michael snarled, glaring at him. "Lucy's in danger!"

Ethan didn't budge. "You'll only get in the way."

As the two struggled, Lucy calmly drew three talismans from her sleeve. The papers ignited without wind, transforming into three fiery barriers that blocked the advancing insects.

Clink! Three divination coins shot through the air, striking the ghostly flames with pinpoint accuracy.

Elder Malakar's face twisted in shock. He hastily bit his finger and drew a bloody sigil on his palm—but before the curse could take form, a golden light from Lucy shattered it.

Cough! The elder spat black blood, staggering backward.

With a venomous glare at Hank Cooper and the others, he barked at the kidnappers, "Bring them here!"

Five or six armed men immediately swung their guns toward the hostages.

"Stand down!" Victor Stone commanded, but the dark muzzles forced him to retreat.

Elder Malakar sneered, pulling out a wooden effigy carved with sinister runes. His fingers, slick with corpse oil, smeared across its surface.

"Pathetic tricks." Lucy scoffed and flicked her fingers.

Crack! The effigy split cleanly in two.

The elder's eyes bulged in disbelief. "Impossible! My sigil hex—"

Before he could finish, he clutched his chest and collapsed to his knees, black blood oozing from his seven orifices.

"Shoot them! Kill them all!" he shrieked hysterically.

As the kidnappers prepared to fire, Ethan flicked several leaves from his hand.

Whoosh!
"Ahh!" The gunmen howled as the leaves sliced deep into their wrists.

"Holy sh—!" Hank gaped. "Ethan, are you in a damn martial arts movie?"

Seizing the moment, Lucy formed a hand seal. "Array, rise!"

Seven crimson beams erupted from the ground, and the kidnappers suddenly turned on each other like madmen.

"The Seven-Kill Bone Mirage?!" Elder Malakar's face contorted in horror. "That array was lost to time! How could you—"

Lucy ignored him, her gaze snapping to the central hut—where the mysterious leader had already vanished.

"Ran fast." She narrowed her eyes, a theory forming in her mind.

Ian Stone... Could he be the same person?
###Chapter 96: The Mystery of the Tracking Talisman

Boom!

A flare exploded in the night sky, its brilliant light illuminating the entire jungle. Hank Cooper and Victor Stone exchanged a glance before swiftly subduing the brawling men.

Lucy White flicked her fingers, sending three divination coins arcing gracefully through the air.

"Release!"

At her command, the bound men gradually regained clarity in their eyes. They stared blankly at the ropes around them, with no memory of what had just happened.

"What… happened to me?"
"Who tied me up?"

Only the white-haired elder continued to thrash wildly, snarling like a beast.

"What’s wrong with him?" Hank frowned.

Lucy pocketed the coins. "The backlash of a blood hex. There’s no saving him."

Hank sighed regretfully. The old man had been a valuable lead—if only they could have taken him in for questioning…

"This isn’t the time for regrets," Lucy suddenly cut in. "The leader got away."

Hank snapped back to attention and rushed into the central hut with Victor. Sure enough, it was empty.

By the time the special forces arrived, Hank was pacing impatiently.

"Commander! Do we need a tracking talisman?" He turned to Lucy, struck by inspiration.

Lucy raised a brow. "I’ll need something that carries his scent."

Hank immediately grabbed one of the captives and soon returned with a cup and two jackets.

"Hmm?" Lucy lightly touched the fabric, her brow furrowing. "These two items carry different traces."

The captive insisted, "They both belonged to the leader!"

"Maybe someone else handled them," Hank dismissed.

Lucy said nothing more and quickly drew three tracking talismans.

"Light them and follow the flame."

When the commander took the talismans, his lips twitched. This thing can actually track a fugitive? Yeah, right.

But seeing the solemn expressions on Hank and Victor’s faces, he swallowed his skepticism.

The teams split up. The moment the talisman ignited, the commander’s eyes widened—

The flame hovered in midair, drifting forward as if guided by an unseen force.

"What the hell…" one of the men muttered under his breath.

An hour later, at the coastline.

Bang!

A bullet whizzed through the air—only to veer off course unnervingly as it neared the helicopter.

Victor raised his binoculars, his pupils contracting. "It’s the blood mage! He’s casting a spell!"

The two helicopters grew smaller in the distance before vanishing into the night.

"Damn it!" Hank slammed his fist into the sand.

The commander stared at the ashes of the talisman in his hand, his expression unreadable. For the first time, he realized there truly were forces in this world that defied scientific explanation.

"Fall back," he said grimly. "At least we recovered the hostages."

Lucy stood atop a jagged rock, the sea breeze lifting her hair. Gazing at the horizon where the helicopters had disappeared, she frowned in thought.

Those two scents on the jackets…
Was it really just a coincidence?
###Chapter 97: A Heart-Stopping Pursuit

The roar of the helicopter faded into the distance before Commander Holt signaled the team to retreat.

"Did you get a clear look at their leader?" the commander asked in a low voice.

Hank Cooper and Victor Stone exchanged glances before nodding in unison.

"Lily Green called him Ian Stone," Hank quickly explained their connection, emphasizing the signal marker incident.

The commander frowned. "Was she the one who suggested this location for the show?"

"Unlikely," Hank shook his head. "Seemed like a chance encounter with someone from her past."

"Any photos?" the commander pressed.

Hank grimaced. "Almost got caught. Didn’t manage to snap one. But we can work with a sketch."

A determined glint flashed in his eyes. "I’ll request a task force as soon as we’re back. We will track him down."

"Good." The commander clapped him on the shoulder. "Keep a close eye on Lily Green too."

At the mention of Lucy White, the commander’s expression brightened. "Heard her talismans are effective?"

"More than just effective!" Hank gestured excitedly. "You saw the tracking talisman in action. The medicinal charm is even more incredible—just wearing it eases pain instantly."

The commander considered for a moment. "Can we commission more from her? Compensation isn’t an issue."

"Already on it," Hank grinned. "I’ll approach her after the livestream wraps up."

"Get it done, and I’ll put in a commendation for your team." He paused. "And for Lucy as well."

Hank’s eyes lit up. "Thanks, Commander!"

Meanwhile, by the campfire, a crowd had gathered.

"Ethan! Those leaf projectiles were insane!" The trainees gazed at him in awe.

Ethan Smith offered a modest smile. "Just a minor trick."

Michael Johnson rolled his eyes internally. Who does he think he’s fooling?

Then, attention shifted to Lucy.

"Lucy! How did you make those venomous insects turn on each other like that?"

She blinked innocently. "Maybe they just had a sudden existential crisis?"

The group fell silent.

The director approached nervously. "Hank, are we… still filming?"

"Absolutely." Hank’s tone left no room for argument. "Act like nothing happened tonight."

He scanned the group. "The island is secure. No need to worry."

The guests exchanged glances—with Lucy around, what was there to fear?

That night, sleep would elude them all.
###Chapter 98: Operation Midnight

In the cave, Lucy White suddenly opened her eyes.

She rose quietly and had just reached the entrance when familiar footsteps echoed behind her.

"Ethan?" she whispered.

Ethan Smith emerged from the shadows, the moonlight outlining his tall, lean frame. "Going to deal with the beast bones?"

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "How did you know?"

"Lucky guess," he replied, the corner of his mouth lifting. "The Seven-Kill Bone Mirage can't be left intact."

Her pulse quickened. This man always seemed to read her thoughts.

"Together?" he asked.

She nodded. Moving in perfect sync, they slipped past the patrolling special forces and vanished into the night.

Outside the cabin, a guard stifled a yawn.

He never noticed the two figures silently unearthing the buried bones.

"This sigil..." Ethan traced the eerie markings on the bone with his fingertips.

Lucy handed him a small knife. "Just scrape it off."

Under the moonlight, they knelt side by side, meticulously working through each bone. Ethan's movements were precise and practiced, as if he'd done this countless times before.

Lucy stole a glance at him. The concealment technique he used felt hauntingly familiar, but her memory remained frustratingly blurred, like a veil she couldn't lift.

"Done." Ethan buried the last bone back in the earth.

Lucy murmured an incantation, pressing a decay sigil into the soil where it dissolved without a sound.

"Let's go." She dusted off her hands.

When they returned to the cave, Michael Johnson was tossing restlessly in his sleeping bag.

Seeing Lucy's empty bed, his chest tightened. He was about to go search for her when soft footsteps sounded at the entrance.

Moonlight revealed Lucy and Ethan walking in one after the other. Michael's fists clenched.

At dawn, Lucy rose to find Michael immediately at her side.

"Lucy..." He hesitated, words caught in his throat.

She kept walking. "I'm going to wash up."

"I'll come with you!" he blurted.

Lucy glanced back toward the cave. "I'll wake the others to join us."

Michael's smile froze. Watching her retreating figure, an ache spread through his chest.

The girl who once only had eyes for him now wouldn't even give him a moment alone.

And Ethan...

Michael's hands balled into fists. The way that man looked at Lucy—he knew that gaze all too well.

It was the same way he himself had once looked at her.

A wave of urgency crashed over him. Taking a deep breath, Michael followed her into the cave.

He had to do something before he lost her completely...

[Plot Teaser]

Ethan's true identity is about to be revealed
What lengths will Michael go to win Lucy back?
What secrets lie within the stolen Black Horizon files?
###Chapter 99: Gaining a Bunch of Admirers
Morning sunlight filtered through the leaves as Lucy White tiptoed into the cave.

"Time to wake up," she whispered.

Ethan Smith was already packed and waiting by the rock wall. The other guests stirred awake, stretching and yawning. The production crew bustled around, adjusting equipment before restoring the livestream feeds.

"I remember a stream nearby," Lucy said, glancing around. "Who wants to freshen up?"

"Me!"
"Take me with you!"
"Wait for me, Lucy!"

Nearly everyone raised their hands—except Lily Green, who stayed rooted in place.

"I’ll stay and keep Daniel company," she forced a smile. "Just bring me some water."

Last night’s failure weighed on her. She never expected Ian’s men to be so useless. At least he got away…

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

"No need," Daniel Miller said flatly, shifting away.

Lily’s smile froze.

[LOL Daniel’s savage!]
[What’s Lily plotting now?]
[Stay away from our Daniel!]

Fans flooded the live comments, oblivious to the faint wisp of white mist drifting from Lily’s body.

By the stream, the group marveled at Lucy’s sense of direction.

"How do you remember all these paths?" Ryan Clark asked, awestruck.

"Seriously, I’m already lost," Noah Adams groaned, rubbing his temples.

Lucy chuckled. "Maybe I just have good spatial memory."

She led them to bird nests and wild berries before guiding everyone back effortlessly.

"Lucy’s basically a human GPS!"
"I’m officially a Lucy fan from now on!"
"Same here!"

The trainees clamored with admiration until Ryan blurted out, cheeks pink, "Can we call you Lucy-bear?"

"Of course," Lucy’s eyes crinkled. "That’s what my fans call me."

[AHHH Lucy-bear’s smile is lethal!]
[Wifey look at me!]
[Lucy-bear, mommy loves you!]

The comments exploded as mom-fans and girlfriend-fans vied for attention.

Michael Johnson watched the screen, a sour pang in his chest. Then an idea struck—maybe… he could become a fan too?

The thought made his pulse quicken. Maybe this was the best way to reconnect with her.

Ethan stood nearby, a faint smile playing on his lips. He didn’t need to be a fan—he had a far more exclusive role.

Outside the cave, Lily listened to the laughter, nails digging into her palms.

Her reflection in the water revealed her dwindling luck.

"This can’t go on," she muttered through gritted teeth.

Lucy noticed Lily’s tension, her lips curving slightly.

The real game had only just begun.
###Chapter 100: Lucy's Guidance, Effortless Success

The morning sunlight filtered through the leaves as Lucy stretched lazily and popped the last wild berry into her mouth.

"Let's move out!" She clapped her hands, and the team immediately fell in line.

The live comments exploded:
[Lucy’s masterclass is starting!]
[Front-row seats ready!]

As they walked, Lucy lightly tapped various plants, effortlessly explaining their properties. She occasionally shared survival tips, leaving the group in awe.

"Tree bark can be used as gauze?"
"This weed can actually stop bleeding?"

During a break, someone suddenly gasped, "Look! There’s a giant beehive up there!"

Everyone craned their necks, watching the dense swarm of bees circling the hive, their scalps tingling with unease.

"Forget it, that honey isn’t worth the risk."
"One sting could be deadly."

Lucy, however, chuckled. "Relax. They’re relocating."

She pointed at the swarm. "The old queen is stepping down, and the new queen is leading most of the workers to establish a new colony. Once they’re gone, the leftover honey is ours."

[Holy crap, she knows this too?]
[Is Lucy a walking encyclopedia or what?]

While the bees moved out, Lucy led the group on a treasure hunt through the jungle.

"This wild herb makes the best salad."
"Bamboo shoots should have yellow tips."
"See these tracks? There must be wild rabbits nearby."

Robert Lee, arms full of loot, grinned ear to ear. "Following Lucy means three meals a day—plus snacks!"

William Jones, clumsily weaving a bamboo basket, looked up. "More than just food—it’s like taking a survival masterclass!"

Olivia Davis waved a freshly dug ginseng root excitedly. "Being carried has never felt so good!"

The livestream comments went wild:
[So jealous!]
[Wish I were there!]
[Lucy, need a human accessory?]

Lily Green lingered at the edge of the group, her nails digging into her palms. She tried several times to interject but found herself outmatched by Lucy’s expertise.

"Why her...?" She glared at Lucy, the center of attention, her eyes dark with resentment.

Meanwhile, in the control room, the director grinned at the skyrocketing ratings.

"An unexpected windfall!" He rubbed his hands. "Lucy’s a godsend for this show!"

On screen, Lucy demonstrated how to weave a hammock from vines. Sunlight dappled her face through the leaves, accentuating her striking features.

[Why just screenshot? Stare in awe!]
[Is this beauty even real?]

When the first drop of honey dripped into the bamboo container, cheers erupted through the jungle.

"Sweet!" Robert licked his fingers, eyes sparkling.

Lucy smiled as she distributed the honey. "Remember, always leave a third for the bees to survive winter."

[Details reveal character.]
[Officially in love.]

As the sun set, the team returned, singing, their arms full of the day’s bounty. No one noticed Lily trailing behind, her gaze fixed on Lucy’s back—a flash of malice in her eyes.
###Chapter 101: The Tiny Sprite

By the time Lucy White returned to the beehive with her gathered food, the bees had mostly vacated.

She pulled out the bamboo tubes she'd prepared earlier and began teaching the group how to extract honey.

"So this is why Lucy had us make these!" William Jones exclaimed, finally understanding. "I thought it was just for fun."

The others marveled. "Only Lucy would think three steps ahead like this."

The trainees were especially impressed. "Professor Lucy is amazing. We have so much to learn from her."

The massive hive yielded enough honey to fill everyone's bamboo tubes. For the first time, the director allowed them to keep the wild honey—a silent apology for yesterday's ordeal.

After lunch, they continued their trek, and Lucy effortlessly sourced ingredients for dinner.

The director checked the livestream stats and was surprised to find that the audience preferred watching the guests coast along with Lucy rather than struggle through survival challenges.

"Viewers are tired of the traditional survival format," the assistant director observed. "This lighthearted approach feels fresh."

The director slapped his thigh. "You're right!"

In the following days, the production crew broke from routine, letting everyone enjoy the island life under Lucy's lead. The guests were stunned by the sudden ease, but the audience loved it. Lucy's social media following skyrocketed by millions.

On their final night, the group stargazed and chatted until late.

At dawn, Lucy was roused by faint cries for help. She sprang up and followed the sound.

Nearby, Ethan Smith opened his eyes but stayed put. He trusted she could handle it.

In a moonlit clearing, a leopard clutched a tiny ink monkey in its jaws. Lucy flung her machete, striking the beast with precision. The predator yelped and fled, leaving the barely breathing creature behind.

The ink monkey weakly pointed to the treetops. Lucy parted the leaves and found a newborn monkey, trembling and alone.

"You want me to care for it?" she whispered.

The mother monkey nuzzled her hand before closing its eyes for the last time.

Lucy buried the mother and recited a blessing over the grave. When she cradled the shivering infant, it immediately clung to her finger.

This was no ordinary monkey—it was a rare ink monkey, a cherished companion of scholars in ancient times. Lucy gathered berries to feed the tiny sprite, already resolved to raise it.

Under the moonlight, she carried the new life back to camp, its steady breaths warming her fingertips.
###Chapter 102: Inklet's New Home

Lucy White curled up in her sleeping bag as a tiny furry creature instinctively burrowed into her arms.

Morning sunlight filtered through the leaves as Lucy carefully tucked the little one into her pocket. Leading the group to a crystal-clear stream, everyone freshened up before embarking on another day of foraging.

Luck was on their side. They caught three wild chickens and discovered a dozen ripe coconuts beneath a palm tree. When Lucy announced coconut chicken stew for lunch, cheers erupted.

"At this rate, we'll be out of the forest by afternoon," Lucy estimated. Seven days—the perfect duration for this island survival challenge.

The aroma of coconut stew soon filled the air. Milky broth bubbled in the pot while the others prepped ingredients.

"This smells incredible!"
"Only Lucy could pull this off."
"I can't wait to taste it!"

The group gathered around, eagerly serving themselves. Tender chicken paired with sweet coconut broth earned unanimous praise.

Daniel Miller downed two bowls, smacking his lips. "Lucy, marry me. This cooking alone is worth it."

"Dream on. You're not good enough for her," Olivia Davis teased.

"Exactly. Lucy deserves a young heartthrob," Robert Lee added.

Michael Johnson's grip tightened around his bamboo bowl. He sipped his soup, masking his irritation.

Just then, a tiny head peeked from Lucy's pocket.

"What's that?" Olivia gasped.

Everyone crowded around as Lucy gently produced the creature, feeding it coconut broth from a bamboo spoon. It nuzzled her palm affectionately after drinking.

"Oh my god! It's adorable!" Olivia clutched her chest. "A monkey? But it's so small!"

Robert's eyes widened. "Wait... is that an ink monkey?"

Lucy nodded. "Sharp eyes, Robert."

"Ink monkey?" Daniel looked baffled.

Robert launched into an excited explanation. The group gaped when they learned it could grind ink, consume it, and even live in a brush holder.

The director rushed over, eyes gleaming. "Lucy, this is—"

"Rescued it last night in the woods," Lucy said simply. "Its mother entrusted it to me."

The creature seemed to understand, nuzzling her palm again.

"Well..." The director hesitated, then smiled. "Of course you can keep it. This is international waters, and you saved it. Perfectly reasonable."

"Thank you." Lucy stroked its fur. "You're my little treasure now."

The ink monkey chirped softly in response. Bathed in sunlight, the pair created a heartwarming scene no one could look away from.
###Chapter 103: A Surge of Jealousy

The appearance of the ink monkey instantly electrified the atmosphere. These legendary creatures were nearly extinct, making this encounter a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Lily Green's nails dug into her palms as she stared at the tiny creature perched on Lucy White's shoulder. A quick search on her phone had revealed just how rare and intelligent these animals were. What stung even more was how obedient the little beast was to Lucy.

"Eeek!" The ink monkey suddenly shrank against Lucy's neck, its furry body trembling.

Lucy's sharp gaze lifted just in time to catch the malice flickering in Lily's eyes before she could mask it. With a cold smirk, Lucy gently stroked the creature's back.

Ethan Smith spoke up at just the right moment. "Give it a name." His quiet tone carried an unmistakable note of protectiveness.

"You like the name Inklet, don't you?" Lucy teased, scratching under the monkey's chin.

The little creature immediately nuzzled her fingers, letting out an adorable chirp in response.

"Oh my god! It actually understands her!" Olivia Davis gasped.

Robert Lee adjusted his glasses. "Ancient texts say ink monkeys are highly perceptive. Seeing it in person is truly remarkable."

The livestream chat exploded:
[OMG what kind of magical creature is this?!]
[Did anyone else see Lily's glare just now? Chilling.]
[Even Lucy's pet is next-level amazing!]

On the helicopter ride back, the group chattered excitedly about their seven-day adventure. Daniel Miller suddenly groaned, "My coconut chicken hotpot! I won't get to eat it once we're back!"

"I call dibs on being on Lucy's team next episode!" Robert raised his hand.

"Dream on," Ethan said smoothly, adjusting his cufflinks. "First come, first served."

In the corner, Michael Johnson's expression darkened. His jaw clenched as he watched Ethan's hand rest casually on the back of Lucy's seat, bitterness spreading from his chest to the tip of his tongue.

"Director, please tell me the next episode won't be another disaster," William Jones asked warily.

The director smirked. "I guarantee it'll be unforgettable."

Lily cut in, "If Daniel needs time to recover, will there be a replacement guest?" Her eyes gleamed with calculation.

Daniel shot her a knowing look. "Yeah, someone's going to be disappointed."

Inklet suddenly bared its tiny teeth at Lily, making her flinch back. Lucy chuckled as she scratched the monkey's chin, though her gaze remained icy.

The helicopter skimmed over the azure sea, carrying its passengers—each lost in their own thoughts—back to civilization. No one noticed Michael quietly snapping a photo of Lucy playing with Inklet before setting it as his phone wallpaper.
###Chapter 104: Too Late

The helicopter roared as it landed on the tarmac, and the exhausted crew descended the steps. The latest survival livestream had finally come to an end.

For once, the director granted everyone a week’s break before the upcoming live performance.

The moment Lucy White stepped off the plane, her phone buzzed. It was her mother, telling her to head straight to Michael Johnson’s house for dinner.

Michael had also received a call from his mother, and the corners of his lips lifted unconsciously. He quickened his pace to catch up with Lucy. "Grace is at my place. Mom wants us both to come."

Lucy nodded. "Fine. We’ll take your car."

Michael’s eyes brightened, his grin spreading like a carefree boy’s.

As they walked through the terminal, fans erupted at the sight of his rare, radiant smile.

"Oh my god! Michael actually smiled!"
"I’m gonna faint!"

Usually cool and composed, Michael rarely showed such warmth. Fans squealed and stomped in excitement.

Lucy wrinkled her nose and sidestepped away.

Michael tried to follow, but a swarm of fans blocked his path, forcing him to pause and sign autographs.

Meanwhile, Lucy’s own supporters called out to her:

"Lucy! Over here!"
"Even without makeup, she’s stunning!"

Lucy pressed a finger to her lips with a smile. "Keep it down, okay? Let’s not disturb others."

Instantly, the crowd hushed.

"Can we get autographs?" a dedicated fan asked hopefully.

"Of course." Lucy led them to a quieter corner, patiently signing and posing for photos.

Before leaving, she whispered mysteriously, "Tomorrow night, I’ll be giving away a lucky charm on Twitter. Don’t forget to enter."

The fans gasped, barely suppressing their squeals.

Twenty minutes later, Michael finally made it to the parking lot.

"Sorry for making you wait," he said guiltily.

Lucy didn’t look up from her phone. "It’s fine."

Silence settled in the car. Michael gathered his courage. "Any plans after the show wraps?"

"Filming." Her reply was clipped.

"I’ve got two solid scripts—"

Lucy suddenly lifted her gaze, her expression odd. "Michael, have you lost your mind lately?"

He’d never shown interest in her career before.

His throat tightened. "I want to make up for—"

"Too late." She cut him off. "I don’t need it."

Her eyes locked onto his. "My agent handles my work. Don’t bother."

The words stabbed through his chest. He opened his mouth, but no sound came out.

When the car stopped outside the Johnson estate, Michael hurried to open her door.

"Thanks." Her tone was distant.

Standing there, Michael could almost hear the playful voice from his memories:

"Michael, open the door for me~"
"You’re the best!"

But now, all that remained was her cold retreat. A crushing realization hit him—some things were truly beyond repair.
###Chapter 105: The Ghost Marriage Pact

Lucy White and Michael Johnson had just stepped into the Johnson family villa when they spotted Grace White and the others waiting in the living room.

"Lucy, you're here." Grace beckoned her daughter warmly. "Come sit with us."

"Mom!" Lucy hurried over, settling beside her mother affectionately before greeting Rachel Johnson and Edward Johnson.

Michael stood straight and addressed Grace respectfully, "Aunt Grace."

Grace gave him a complicated look but quickly composed herself, nodding faintly in response.

"Sis!" Noah White's eyes lit up eagerly. "Did you bring Inklet?"

Lucy smiled and unzipped her backpack, carefully lifting out the tiny creature fast asleep inside. She had lined the bag with a soft blanket to create a cozy nest for the ink monkey, especially since she was wearing a dress today.

"You can hold him for a bit." She passed the little one to her brother.

"Thanks, sis!" Noah cradled Inklet gently. The monkey nuzzled into his palm before dozing off again.

Edward leaned in curiously, trying to play with the legendary ink monkey, only for the nimble creature to dodge his touch.

"..." Edward retracted his hand awkwardly and shot his son a glare. "This is your fault. Inklet won’t even let me pet him."

Michael: "???" How was this his fault?

During dinner, Grace and Rachel asked Lucy about her experiences on the deserted island. Edward chimed in occasionally, making the atmosphere warm and lively.

After the meal, Edward suddenly asked, "Lucy, are you free these next couple of days?"

"I am. Did you need something, Uncle Edward?" Lucy set down her teacup.

"A friend of mine is dealing with something strange at home. They asked for your help after hearing about what happened with the Wu family." Edward explained.

Lucy agreed without hesitation. "No problem. Just let me know when."

Edward made a call immediately and confirmed, "Tomorrow at 10 a.m. Does that work?"

"Sure. Send me the address—I’ll drive there myself." Lucy said.

Edward glanced at his silent son and sighed inwardly. This kid can’t even offer to drive her?

The next morning, Lucy arrived at a luxurious villa right on time. Edward and a weary middle-aged woman were already waiting at the entrance.

"This is Irene Powell. You can call her Aunt Irene." Edward introduced.

"Aunt Irene." Lucy greeted politely.

Irene forced a strained smile. "Master Lucy, hello!"

The three entered the living room, where a gaunt young man struggled to his feet weakly. "Uncle Edward. Master Lucy."

Edward was stunned. The vibrant young man he’d seen two months ago was now barely recognizable, his health deteriorated drastically.

Lucy studied Vincent Powell for a moment before asking abruptly, "Are you married?"

"Huh?" Vincent looked bewildered. "I don’t even have a girlfriend."

"Strange." Lucy frowned slightly. "Your marriage line clearly shows you’re already wed."

Irene and her son exchanged confused glances.

Lucy pressed further, "The nightmares you’ve been having—does a woman in red appear in them?"

Vincent’s eyes widened in shock. "How did you know?"

Irene paled. "Master Lucy, what—what does this mean?"

Lucy’s voice turned grave. "Your son has been bound in a ghost marriage. That woman in red is his 'spectral bride.'"

"That’s impossible!" Irene cried out. "Our family would never do something like this!"

Vincent panicked. "I don’t even know the woman in my dreams!"

Lucy’s gaze sharpened. "Have you received any strange betrothal gifts recently?"
###Chapter 106: The Big Fish

Edward Johnson studied their bewildered expressions and quickly pieced together the situation.

"Lucy," he turned to Lucy White, "is there something more to this? Other than Vincent Powell himself, who else could arrange a ghost marriage for him?"

Lucy tapped her fingers lightly on the table. "That's exactly what I was about to say."

"Mr. Powell's marital palace indicates he's already wed, but the bond is fractured—clearly a forced union." She locked eyes with Vincent. "Only a blood relative could have done this, using your birth hex, hair, and blood."

Vincent's pupils constricted. "It has to be family?"

"Absolutely." Lucy's tone left no room for doubt. "A ghost marriage isn't just about the birth hex. It requires an elder blood relative because—" She paused. "These rituals demand parental authority and a matchmaker's mediation."

"That woman in your dreams—was she wearing bridal robes?"

Vincent's face drained of color. "Yes... red bridal robes..."

No wonder she had been so relentless in dragging him away in his nightmares. Every time the coffin appeared, no matter how hard he fought, he couldn't escape.

Irene Powell's grip tightened on the armrest. "Could it be the Powells...?"

Her own family had long since dwindled, but her late husband's relatives were numerous. Since his passing, she had gone out of her way to support them—even promoting her brother-in-law's son, Julian, to vice president.

"No way..." Vincent muttered.

Lucy cut straight to the heart of it. "You've been bound for thirty days. Nineteen more, and you'll die suddenly." Her gaze sharpened. "Think—who stands to gain the most from your death? Who could easily obtain your hair and blood?"

Vincent looked as if he'd been struck by lightning.

If he died, his mother's vast fortune would... His cousin, Julian Powell...

"Could it be someone else?" His voice trembled. "Ms. White, if you saw the person, would you recognize them?"

"I would."

His phone rang. The caller ID made his expression twist.

After hanging up, he said quietly, "I asked him to come pick up some documents. Please... take a look for me."

Twenty minutes later, a handsome man in a tailored suit walked in.

"Aunt Irene." His eyes swept the room, nodding politely at Michael Johnson—but flickered imperceptibly when they landed on Lucy.

Irene's smile was flawless. "Have a seat."

Julian studied Vincent with concern. "You look terrible—another fever?"

Vincent stared at him for a long moment before forcing a smile. "Just the usual."

"Let me take you to the hospital." Julian reached out to steady him, but Vincent sidestepped the touch.

"No need. I've already been checked." He handed over a file. "The project is yours now."

As Julian took it, Lucy narrowed her eyes—his ring finger bore an eerie bronze ring.

The moment Julian left, Irene demanded, "Was it him?"

Lucy sighed. "He's wearing the ghost marriage token, and his aura is tangled with Mr. Powell's karmic threads." She met the ashen faces of mother and son. "And... I smelled corpse oil on him."


###Chapter 107: Karma Strikes Back

Lucy White never expected Julian Powell to be Vincent Powell's cousin. In the original storyline, Powell Pharmaceuticals was still called Liu Pharmaceuticals at this point.

She remembered reading that Julian's aunt had treated him like her own son, yet named him heir before her accidental death. Later, he obtained an ancient formula that elevated Powell Pharmaceuticals to new heights.

But neither the original story nor online forums ever mentioned Powell Pharmaceuticals' origins as Liu Pharmaceuticals. The misfortunes of the Liu mother and son had been deliberately buried—undoubtedly Julian's doing.

No wonder Vincent showed signs of early demise, and Irene Powell's forehead bore dark omens. Julian had been pulling strings all along.

A cold glint flashed in Lucy's eyes. Eliminating one of Lily Green's powerful suitors early to weaken the protagonist's luck? She couldn't ask for more.

Besides, Julian's betrayal deserved retribution. She'd handle this without remorse.

Irene's fingers dug into the sofa armrest, her face pale. She should've realized—if her son died, Julian stood to gain the most.

"Master Lucy, can my son be saved?" Her voice trembled.

Vincent stared desperately at Lucy, eyes burning with survival instinct.

"There's time," Lucy nodded. "Ten days later would've been too late."

Irene slumped in relief, tears streaming.

"Two solutions." Lucy raised two fingers. "First: forcibly break the ghost marriage."

"But this damages vitality, shortening lifespan."

"And the second?" Irene pressed.

Lucy's lips curved. "Transfer the ghost marriage. Must be a blood relative."

Irene's eyes blazed with hatred. "Julian?"

"Exactly." Lucy's tone turned meaningful. "This is called returning the sender's own poison."

"Option two!" Irene spat through clenched teeth.

Lucy, having anticipated this, produced a talisman brush: "I'll need birth details, hair, blood samples, and the original marriage contract."

"I'll obtain them," Irene vowed.

Lucy handed Vincent a talisman. "Ward against evil. Keep it close."

She then wrote an herbal list: "Gather these quickly. I'll prepare vitality elixirs."

Irene accepted the list, showering gratitude as she escorted Lucy out.

At home, Vincent recalled, "Julian brought me home the night I fell ill."

"My finger stung inexplicably—now I understand..."

Irene sneered. "That ungrateful viper!"

"Rest now." She tucked him in. "I'll gather evidence and herbs."

Vincent nodded weakly.

Meanwhile, Edward Johnson fretted: "Could this backfire on you?"

Lucy smiled. "Karma won't touch me."

Gazing out the window, her eyes turned glacial. Once the ghost marriage transferred, let's see how Lily Green clings to this big fish.
###Chapter 108: Privilege Beyond Envy

The moment Lucy White stepped through her front door, her phone began vibrating incessantly. Tossing her bag onto the sofa, she tapped the screen and instantly uploaded a photo of a crimson-drawn good luck talisman to Weibo.

@LucyWhiteV: Repost this fortune charm for wishes granted within seven days. Limited to first 5,000 reposts. Requirements: 1. Genuine effort 2. No illegal activities 3. Excludes lottery/gambling (wink.jpg)

Within three seconds, reposts surpassed a thousand.

[Ahhh I got it! Lucy's charms always work!]
[Was writing my thesis when the notification popped up—bless the algorithm!]
[Last repost got me that job offer—now I'm using this for my crush!]

The comments section flooded with adoration. One fan posted photos of cookies Lucy had personally handed out during yesterday's airport greeting, triggering waves of envy.

[An angel idol! She even drew little hearts on the wrappers!]
[Why didn't I go to the airport?? sobs]
[Wifey notice me!] — This comment promptly got buried under a tsunami of "GTFO" replies from female fans.

Three minutes later, the system announced all charms were claimed. Those who missed out wailed collectively:

[I was in the bathroom for two minutes!]
[Give advance notice next time—I'll queue with five phones!]
[@LucyWhiteV Please repost? I'll trade my BFF's decade of singledom!]

Watching her DMs explode, Lucy replied "Activated" to a few familiar fans. Her fan club group chat immediately erupted with 99+ screenshot spams.

At dawn the next day, the doorbell rang. The Powell family had delivered medicinal ingredients in sandalwood boxes, accompanied by a jade mortar set. Tying on an apron, Lucy began brewing herbs, filling the apartment with crisp medicinal fragrance.

Just as her vitality elixirs finished, the Johnson family car arrived downstairs. Vincent Powell's hands trembled holding the crystal vial—he'd finally slept through the night for the first time in months.

"Mom, we found something." Vincent stared at detective-sent photos. "Grandma visited that blood mage again last week."

Irene Powell sneered: "Ghost marriage scheming again." Grabbing her coat, she stormed out. "Time to educate that hag."

In the show's rehearsal room, Lucy adjusted a trainee's sheet music. When Ethan Smith entered, the room froze for three full seconds.

"Flight delay." He naturally settled beside Lucy at the piano. "Need harmonies?"

Jason Wright's pen clattered to the floor. This was Grammy-winning Ethan Smith—now tuning their pitch?

Screams suddenly erupted from Lily Green's closed rehearsal space. A passing crew member whispered theatrically: "Heard the new guest is..."

"Who?" Ears perked up.

The crew mimed zipping lips. "Director's orders—live reveal only."

At wrap time, Ethan intercepted Lucy at the elevator. "Need a ride?"

"Sure." She waved her phone. "Mrs. Powell booked an exorcism tonight."

Their departing silhouettes made trainees bite their sleeves in envy.

"Was Ethan smiling just now? Definitely smiling!"
"Lemons grow on trees, but we're the ones sour."
"Stop whining—that's the real-deal Talismancer Lucy..."

Parking lot lights stretched their shadows long. Ethan suddenly spoke: "About that ghost marriage contract..."

"Hmm?" Lucy turned.

"Call me," he opened the passenger door, eyes glinting, "if you need backup."

(To Be Continued)

*Key localization notes:

"LEMONs" retained as fandom name for brand consistency
"Talismancer" coined as cultural equivalent for 天师
"Blood mage" used for 神婆 to emphasize dark magic connotation
Westernized reactions (e.g. "GTFO" for 滚)
"Hex" consistently replaces 蛊/降头 for readability
Grammy reference establishes Ethan's prestige equivalent to 格莱美*
###Chapter 109: So This Is the Real Ethan Smith
Michael Johnson sat in his van, fingers rapidly refreshing his Twitter feed. After liking Lucy White’s latest post with his burner account, he quickly switched to her fan group chat.

"OMG this still is everything!"
"Lucy’s profile could end me!"
His thumbs flew across the screen as he spammed the chat alongside dozens of other fans.

The glow of his phone illuminated his sulky expression. He’d known Lucy first, yet here he was, reduced to fawning over her like any other admirer.

Across the parking lot, Ethan Smith casually slung Lucy’s bag over his shoulder, one hand tucked in his pocket.

"Made your decision yet?" His voice was low, the acoustics of the empty garage making it sound even more magnetic.

Lucy arched a brow. "About?"

"The Special Division." Ethan stepped closer, his breath grazing her ear. "I came personally. Convincing enough?"

A flush crept up her neck, but she feigned composure, retreating half a step. "Using your authority for personal gain, Mr. Smith?"

"Guilty." He smirked, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, his fingers barely skimming her cheek. "Full benefits, no desk duty, seven-figure starting salary."

Her eyes lit up. "That generous?"

"Special treatment." His chuckle was velvety. "After all..." He deliberately drew out the pause. "I prefer keeping you close."

Lucy choked on air. "Ethan Smith, your pristine image is crumbling."

"Want to see the real me?" Suddenly, he pressed his car keys into her palm. "Test drive?"

Her pulse stuttered, but she twirled the keyring with forced nonchalance. "Such as?"

"Such as..." He yanked open the driver’s door with a flourish. "Your personal chauffeur."

She burst out laughing and slid into the seat. "Better drive smoothly, Ethan."

"At your service." As he leaned in to buckle her seatbelt, his lips nearly brushed her earlobe. "Your Majesty."

Watching the taillights disappear, Ethan rubbed his chin. His phone buzzed—an encrypted file from the Special Division had just arrived: the official approval for Lucy’s recruitment.

Meanwhile, Hank Cooper slammed his fist on his military office desk. "What? Someone’s already poaching Lucy?!"

His assistant quivered. "Y-yes, sir. Rumor says the Director himself—"

"Ethan?!" Hank’s face darkened. "That old fox!"

Lucy had barely parked at Irene Powell’s villa when the woman rushed out, eyes red-rimmed.

"Master Lucy! Vincent vomited blood this morning, but he insists he feels better..."

Lucy nodded. "Normal reaction. The ghost marriage contract’s backlash is breaking."

Inside, Vincent Powell lay weakly on the sofa, surrounded by aged documents. The topmost sheet—a bloodstained marriage certificate—bore a fingerprint that squirmed unnaturally.

"It’s starting." Lucy flicked a talisman between her fingers, igniting it with a whisper.

As flames licked the certificate, the villa’s temperature plummeted. Irene gasped as the bloody fingerprint oozed dark liquid.

"Don’t panic." Lucy’s fingers moved in a precise pattern. "The curse is transferring."

The names on the parchment writhed as she chanted. When the final character morphed, a distant mansion echoed with a bloodcurdling scream.

"Done." Lucy dusted her hands. "Now Julian Powell gets to enjoy the consequences."

Irene thrust forward a check. "Thank you! The agreed amount—"

"Hold that thought." Lucy’s smile turned sly. "After tomorrow’s headlines, you might want to add a zero."

The next morning, Olivia Davis dragged Lucy into the studio’s green room the moment she arrived.

"Guess who’s here?" Olivia wiggled her eyebrows. "Prepare for shock!"

Before Lucy could react, the door swung open. A tall figure stood silhouetted against the light, his familiar voice laced with amusement:

"Morning, partner."
###Chapter 110: The Arrival of a Diva

Lucy White instantly detected the hidden meaning in Olivia Davis's words.

"Must be a female guest to get you this excited," she teased, blinking playfully.

Olivia clapped her hands. "Bingo! And she's quite the heavyweight."

"Who?" Lucy leaned in curiously.

"Vanessa Knight!" Olivia whispered dramatically. "The infamous 'Iron Diva' herself."

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "The director actually managed to book her?"

"Originally, it was supposed to be Tiffany Quinn," Olivia revealed conspiratorially. "But Vanessa suddenly expressed interest—courtesy of Ethan's connections."

Lucy immediately understood. "Excellent switch!"

She knew Tiffany all too well—Lily Green's latest rising star. In her past life, that man had ridden Lily's coattails from teen idol to award-winning actor.

But with Vanessa in the picture? Things just got infinitely more interesting.

"Rumor has it Vanessa's been... moody lately," Olivia hinted. "Something about relationship troubles."

Lucy connected the dots instantly. Vanessa's fiancé Oliver Knight happened to be Lily's newest conquest. In her previous life, Vanessa had been systematically destroyed by Lily—career ruined, family shattered. This time, history wouldn't repeat itself.

"Sounds like this episode will be explosive," Lucy remarked meaningfully.

The two women exchanged knowing smiles.

Back in the rehearsal room, Ethan Smith was coaching trainees. Spotting Lucy, he naturally gravitated toward her.

"Drink run?" she suggested.

Ethan nodded.

Outside, Lucy cut straight to the chase. "Vanessa Knight was your doing?"

"She volunteered," Ethan chuckled. "I merely greased the wheels."

"You've been investigating Oliver?"

Ethan's eyes turned frosty. "Lily's been cozying up to him lately."

Lucy understood perfectly. Vanessa must have caught wind of the affair.

"This episode just became must-see TV," she smirked.

Ethan ruffled her hair affectionately at her mischievous expression. "Don't overplay your hand."

"Relax," Lucy winked. "I'm just looking forward to watching an iron rose crush a delicate flower."

Their shared laughter spoke volumes.

Returning to rehearsals, they found the trainees on break.

"Ms. White! Mr. Smith!" The students swarmed them eagerly.

Lucy distributed drinks. "Practice hard—recording starts tomorrow."

Her gaze flicked to the wall clock. Less than twenty-four hours until Lily Green and Vanessa Knight's explosive confrontation.

This time, without protagonist's plot armor, she'd see exactly how Lily planned to handle the storm that was coming.
###Chapter 111: Ethan's Multilayered Game

Lucy's eyes narrowed slightly as she caught the smug glint in Ethan's gaze.

"Here to claim credit, Mr. Smith?" Her fingers tapped lightly on the table.

Ethan rested his chin on one hand, rolled-up sleeves revealing toned forearms. "Isn't it obvious?"

Lucy turned away with a quiet laugh, cheeks warming under his direct stare. "The great Ethan Smith went through quite some trouble to recruit me."

"Naturally." He leaned forward suddenly, the faint scent of cedarwood enveloping her. "I always go after what I want."

Her breath hitched.

What was wrong with him today? Strutting around like a peacock in mating season.

"Satisfied, Your Majesty?" His voice dropped deliberately.

Lucy's ears burned. "Who told you to call me that!"

"Wasn't it you last night?" His fox-like grin appeared. "Fits rather well, I think."

"That was a joke!" She grabbed a throw pillow and hurled it at him. "One more word and we're done."

Ethan caught the pillow, then closed the distance between them. "What then? Sweetheart?"

"Ethan!" Lucy bristled.

"Fine, fine." He raised his hands in surrender, though mischief still danced in his eyes. "How about Lu? Just me calling you that."

She studied him suspiciously. "You're acting strange."

"Am I?" His expression remained unreadable.

"Where's the aloof movie star persona?" She poked his shoulder. "Got replaced by a pod person?"

Ethan captured her wandering finger. "Only for you."

The air between them stilled.

Lucy yanked her hand back. "Cut it out!"

Her pulse raced. Had he taken crazy pills today?

"Business." Ethan shifted gears abruptly. "Have you considered the Special Ops offer?"

She exhaled in relief. "Terms?"

"Top clearance." He slid a file across the table like a magician producing flowers. "Direct reporting to me."

As Lucy scanned the document, her eyebrows climbed higher.

This wasn't recruitment—it was rolling out the red carpet for royalty!

"You..." She looked up and found herself drowning in his dark eyes.

Ethan tapped the table. "One-time offer."

She shut the folder. "Why such generous terms?"

"Take a guess?" His hand brushed imaginary dust from her hair.

Lucy froze.

Dangerously close.

"I'm in." She stood abruptly. "One condition."

"Name it."

"Personal space." She pointed at his nose. "One meter minimum."

Ethan chuckled. "As you command, Your Majesty."

"Ethan!"

"My bad." He stepped back, then winced suddenly.

Lucy frowned. "You're hurt?"

"Scratch." He tugged his collar aside, revealing bloodstained gauze.

Her breath caught. That was no scratch—the bandage was seeping crimson!

"Stay still!" She pressed him down. "Where's your first aid kit?"

Ethan submitted to her ministrations, gaze burning.

"Stop staring!" Her hands trembled slightly.

"You're beautiful when flustered."

Lucy cinched the bandage tighter. "Serves you right!"

Ethan suddenly grasped her wrist. "Lu."

"What now?"

"Welcome aboard." His palm scorched her skin. "My... special task force."

Her heart skipped.

This man was absolutely flirting with her!

"Credentials arrive in three days." Releasing her, he resumed his professional demeanor. "I'll take you to HQ."

Lucy blinked, wondering if she'd imagined the entire exchange.

"Partners." She extended a hand.

Ethan's fingers barely grazed hers. "This will be... enjoyable."

His knowing smile made her suddenly question if she'd just boarded a pirate ship.
###Chapter 112 Sweet Moments

Lucy White's eyelashes fluttered as she turned her face away from Ethan Smith's suggestive remark.

"Why don't you ask the group what they'd like to drink?" she murmured, deftly changing the subject.

The corner of Ethan's lips curved upward. He knew she was dodging the topic but played along. "Sure."

His slender fingers tapped across his phone screen as he sent the question to their production crew's group chat.

The pair walked side by side into the ice cream parlor, greeted by a refreshing blast of air conditioning.

"What would you like?" Lucy asked as they approached the counter.

"Lemonade," Ethan answered without hesitation.

Lucy turned to him in surprise. "You like that too?"

His gaze softened as it rested on her. "Always have."

Truthfully, he'd grown to love the sweet-tart flavor only after learning it was her favorite.

By the time they placed their order, Ethan had already received responses from most of the group. For those who hadn't replied, they selected popular drinks by instinct.

The large quantity meant they had to wait, so they settled at a table by the window.

"Oh my god, it's Lucy and Ethan!" A group of girls behind the counter whispered excitedly, barely containing their squeals.

"They're even more gorgeous in person!"

"Look how perfect they look together—our ship is sailing!"

"Did you see how Ethan looks at her? So tender..."

Though they spoke in hushed tones, every word reached Lucy and Ethan's ears.

A ponytailed girl stealthily raised her phone, snapping several photos of the pair.

Ethan noticed from his periphery but didn't stop her. Instead, he subtly leaned closer to Lucy.

Catching his move, Lucy couldn't help but chuckle softly.

When their order was ready, Ethan gathered most of the bags, leaving only the lightest few for Lucy.

"I'll take the heavy ones," he said, as though it were the most natural thing in the world.

The ponytailed girl quickly captured this moment too before rushing over, cheeks flushed, to ask for autographs. She confessed honestly about taking their pictures.

"That's fine," Lucy said warmly as she signed, giving the girl a playful wink. "Send me the good ones."

The girl nearly jumped with excitement. The moment Lucy and Ethan left, she posted the photos in the fan group chat.

Three images instantly set the fandom ablaze:

The first showed Lucy's profile by the window, sunlight gilding her silhouette.

The second captured the pair sharing a smile, Ethan's gaze overflowing with affection.

The third was their retreating figures, Ethan's hand hovering protectively behind Lucy's back.

"I'm deceased! This is too sweet!"

"That look from Ethan just ended me!"

"They're totally real! That protective stance—I can't!"

Amid the squealing, one dissenting voice emerged:

"They don't match at all. Lucy is clearly better with Michael Johnson."

The chat froze for a second before erupting:

"??? Girl, wake up!"

"That jerk Michael doesn't deserve our Lucy!"

"Childhood friends means nothing after how he hurt her!"

Michael Johnson, reading these responses, nearly threw his phone in frustration.

Just then, a knock sounded at the practice room door.

The trainees cheered when they saw Lucy and Ethan carrying drinks.

"Thank you, Mr. Smith! Thank you, Ms. White!"

Olivia Davis accepted her grape milk tea with a grateful smile. Michael stood to the side, watching Lucy intently.

Ethan casually offered him a juice, which Michael ignored.

"I want lemonade," Michael said pointedly to Lucy, his tone bordering on petulant.

Lucy sighed. "Since when do you like sour things?"

"I do now," he insisted stubbornly.

"None left." She pushed a watermelon juice into his hands. "Take it or leave it."

Michael's eyes lit up. "You remembered I—"

"Ethan chose it," Lucy cut him off.

His smile vanished instantly, glaring at the juice as if it had personally offended him.

Ethan bit back a laugh. "Shall we visit the next practice room?" he suggested to Lucy.

After they left, Michael slammed the untouched drink onto a table.

Olivia gave him a pitying look and shook her head.

When Lucy and Ethan approached Lily Green's practice room, Vanessa Knight's icy voice carried through the door:

"What, you think you're some princess everyone should obey?"

This was followed by Lily's tearful reply: "I was just making a suggestion..."
###Chapter 113: Clash of Wills

Ever since Vanessa Knight joined the production crew, Lily Green's days had become unbearable.

"Lily, that move is wrong," Vanessa interrupted the rehearsal again, demonstrating the correct posture with effortless grace that reduced Lily to a mere backdrop.

Lily bit her lip, eyes glistening with unshed tears. Spotting Ethan Smith entering the room, she quickly lowered her head, exposing the delicate curve of her neck.

"Mr. Smith..." Her voice trembled.

But Ethan walked straight past her, handing Vanessa an ice-cold water bottle. "Settling in alright?"

"Absolutely," Vanessa twisted the cap off, winking at Lucy White. "Especially after making new friends."

Lucy returned the smile. "Likewise."

The two beauties exchanged a radiant grin that stung like sunlight.

"Your skin is flawless," Vanessa leaned in, suddenly pinching Lucy's cheek. "What's your secret?"

"Good genes," Lucy smirked. "Though that perfume suits you perfectly."

Vanessa laughed. "Sharp eye!"

Her twirling skirt revealed every curve of her enviable figure.

"Some people," Vanessa's gaze flickered toward Lily, "couldn't pull this off even half-dressed."

Lucy smoothly added, "Not everyone's blessed with the right assets."

Lily's nails dug into her palms as she clenched her skirt. She cast a pleading look at Ethan, only to find him engrossed in his phone.

"Brunch this weekend?" Vanessa slung an arm around Lucy.

"Sure." Lucy pulled out her phone. "Let's exchange contacts."

As they traded numbers, Lily finally bolted from the rehearsal room.

Meanwhile, at the Powell family estate...

"Grandmother, I can't take this..." Julian Powell collapsed onto the sofa, his face ghostly pale.

The elderly matriarch fussed over him. "Another nightmare?"

"The coffin...the woman in red..." Julian trembled violently. "She's coming for me!"

The old woman immediately dialed the blood mage.

Smoke coiled through the mystic's dim chamber. Studying the ghost marriage contract, her expression darkened. "The groom's been switched."

"What?" Julian sprang up.

The blood mage sneered. "Someone altered the hex. Now you're the one bound in this unholy union."

The matriarch's knees buckled. "How...how do we fix this?"

"Find the caster," the blood mage's eyes gleamed with malice. "Make sure she dies first."

Julian clenched his fists. "Irene Powell! It has to be her!"

"Patience." The blood mage produced a gleaming pair of scissors, snipping a lock of Julian's hair. "She'll come to us."

Tossing the strands into a brazier, she watched the flames dance. "The real show's just beginning."
###Chapter 114: Hidden Agenda

Knock, knock, knock—

The withered fingers of the blood mage tapped rhythmically against the table.

She narrowed her murky eyes, her voice dripping with implication. "This technique... it must be Irene Powell and her son. They’ve hired an expert. They’re trying to kill Julian."

"Those wretched snakes!" Old Mrs. Powell slammed her palm on the table, her face twisted with fury.

She conveniently forgot that they had struck first against Vincent.

In her eyes, Irene was nothing but an outsider. Vincent had always been too close to the Powell family, which made him unworthy of her affection.

The most infuriating part? The company rightfully belonged to her son, yet Irene only gave them a measly million or two a year as compensation.

That was her son’s fortune! Now, that woman had stolen it all.

Taking it back was only fair. As for what happened to Vincent? He deserved it.

She conveniently ignored the fact that Powell Pharmaceuticals had been the Powell family’s ancestral business for generations.

"Grandmother!" Julian clutched her hand, his face deathly pale. "They’re trying to kill me!"

Now, his only hope was his grandparents.

Old Mrs. Powell patted his hand soothingly. "Don’t worry, my dear. I won’t let anything happen to you."

Julian turned back to the blood mage. "Master, if they can alter the engagement, then we—"

The blood mage cut him off with a cold glare.

"Search Vincent’s belongings for any talismans or charms," she ordered, rising to retrieve several blood-red stones from a cabinet. "Place these in the Powell residence—preferably in Irene and Vincent’s rooms."

A sinister smile curled her lips. "Even if the engagement is broken, they won’t live long."

Julian’s heart skipped a beat. The blood mage’s hatred for the Powell family seemed to run deeper than just money...

But he knew better than to pry. He took the stones and nodded eagerly.

The blood mage waved him off impatiently. "Get out. Don’t mess this up."

"Yes, yes!" The grandmother and grandson bowed respectfully before leaving.

Back at the Powell estate, the family immediately began scheming.

Old Mrs. Powell ranted about storming the Powell mansion.

Julian stopped her. The Powells held too much power. A direct confrontation would only humiliate them.

Instead, he quickly devised a new plan, and the others eagerly agreed.

Now, the entire family followed his lead—even his stepmother didn’t dare object.

After all, if they wanted a piece of the Powell fortune, they needed his cunning.

Meanwhile, Lucy White had just finished rehearsal when she received a call from Hank Cooper.

He and Victor Stone had come from the neighboring city just to take her to dinner.

Lucy agreed without hesitation and drove to the upscale, private restaurant they’d chosen.

The hostess led her to a private dining room where three men were already seated.

Aside from Hank and Victor, there was a strikingly handsome man in gold-rimmed glasses.

Lucy’s sharp instincts picked up on something—beneath his refined demeanor, the man exuded an unshakable aura of righteousness.

She already had a guess.

"Lucy!" Hank stood up enthusiastically. "This is my cousin, Agent Hanks. He’s with the Special Division."

He turned to the man. "And this is Lucy White, the one I told you about."

Agent Hanks extended his hand with a polite smile. "I’ve heard a lot about you."

Lucy shook his hand gracefully. "Likewise."

"Enough with the formalities!" Hank waved his hands dramatically. "Just use names!"

Agent Hanks chuckled. "He’s right. No need to stand on ceremony."

Lucy nodded. Since she’d already decided to join the Special Division, there was no point in being overly reserved.

Hank poured her tea eagerly. "Lucy, let my cousin explain how things work in the Division."

He shot Agent Hanks a meaningful look.

Agent Hanks straightened. "We need someone with your metaphysical expertise. If time is a concern, you can work as a consultant."

"The Division won’t interfere with your career. You can continue acting," he added, adjusting his glasses. "We operate on a merit-based point system—more assignments mean higher rewards."

His tone darkened. "But this job is dangerous."

Lucy listened intently. She’d already researched the Special Division and wasn’t unfamiliar with its workings.

Agent Hanks’ honesty earned her respect.

"I’ve made my decision," she said, meeting his gaze squarely. "I’ll join."
###Chapter 115: The Director's Authority

Lucy White listened to Agent Hanks' explanation and gained a clearer understanding of the Special Department's operations.

With an apologetic smile, she said, "I'm afraid someone has already extended an invitation for me to join the Special Department."

Hanks' pupils constricted. "What? Someone beat us to it?"

Hank Cooper and Victor Stone exchanged glances, both visibly surprised.

Lucy nodded. "They offered me special terms—official status with complete autonomy, more of a partnership arrangement."

Hanks' breath hitched. "May I ask who made the offer?"

Only the Director had the authority to approve such conditions.

"Your Director," Lucy replied frankly.

The teacup nearly slipped from Hanks' grip. "The Director personally recruited you?"

He'd never imagined the elusive Director would personally approach a newcomer.

"Have you seen his true appearance?" Hanks couldn't help pressing.

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "You haven't?"

Hanks gave a wry smile. "The Director never reveals his face."

Lucy understood—Ethan Smith's identity remained a secret within the department.

"Then how could you be certain it was him?" Hanks still seemed doubtful.

Lucy tapped her temple. "Remember my abilities. Besides, he showed me his credentials."

Admiration flashed in Hanks' eyes. "To make the Director break protocol—Miss White truly is extraordinary."

Lucy smiled confidently. "Your Director has a keen eye for talent."

Cooper interjected, "Seems my judgment wasn't bad either." He shot Hanks a smug look.

Hanks shook his head ruefully—no one could outmaneuver the Director.

The old fox still had his tricks.

"Then we'll be colleagues," Hanks raised his cup. "Looking forward to working together."

Lucy clinked glasses with him. "I'm sure we will."

During the meal, Cooper sampled a dish and sighed. "This is decent, but nowhere near Miss White's cooking."

Since tasting Lucy's dishes, his palate had become spoiled.

Lucy chuckled. "I'll invite you all over for dinner sometime."

The three men brightened immediately. "That would be wonderful!"

As they parted, Hanks lowered his voice. "A blood mage has infiltrated the capital—targeting those born under inauspicious lunar cycles. Over a hundred victims already."

Lucy's heart clenched.

The same blood mage who nearly killed her brother in her past life!

"Any detailed information?" Her voice turned icy.

Hanks shook his head. "Classified, I'm afraid."

Lucy nodded understandingly. "I'll stay vigilant."

Cooper spoke up, "Actually, we have another favor to ask today."

Lucy anticipated him. "The talismans?"

Cooper gave a thumbs-up. "Miss White reads minds. Our unit desperately needs your medicinal charms and tracking sigils."

"I can supply medicinal charms regularly," Lucy agreed readily. "Besides hemostatic ones, I can provide antidotes, fever reducers, and other varieties."

Cooper slammed the table excitedly. "Perfect!"
###Chapter 116: Preemptive Strike

Hank Cooper pressed on stubbornly, "What about the tracking talisman?"

This was the key. With it, they could achieve twice the results with half the effort while reducing the risks for his team.

Lucy White took a sip of tea. "As I mentioned before, a tracking talisman requires locking onto the target's aura, and the range can't exceed 500 kilometers."

"So giving you one now would be useless."

Hank's eyes lit up. "But if we provide an item carrying the target's aura, could you create one?"

"Exactly." Lucy nodded.

The two quickly finalized the details of their collaboration.

For medicinal charms, Lucy only asked for double the ingredients as payment. As for tracking talismans, they would need to supply the target's aura, then compensate her with medicinal ingredients or other items she required.

She didn't charge exorbitant prices—purely out of respect for these special forces soldiers who defended their country.

After all, a single talisman of hers could fetch a million on the black market.

Once the terms were settled, Agent Hanks suddenly spoke up, "Lucy, does your tracking talisman work on blood mages?"

"Unless their power exceeds mine by more than double," Lucy replied confidently.

In this world, there was practically no one stronger than her.

Hanks rubbed his hands together eagerly. "Then could you make one for us? We can pay in credits—since you'll be joining the department soon anyway."

The special department's credit system was flexible, exchangeable for supplies or cash.

Lucy arched a brow. "Trying to track that blood mage?"

"Yes!" Hanks gritted his teeth. "That bastard is too slippery. We've been chasing him for over a year with no luck."

Lucy thought for a moment. "Fine. But I'll need something she's used."

Hanks immediately pulled out a stack of talisman paper, cinnabar, and a few half-finished charms from his bag.

"Will these work?"

Lucy picked up one of the incomplete charms. The handwriting looked oddly familiar.

Wasn't this the same script used in the ghost marriage contract?

Her heart jolted—so the one who had cursed Vincent Powell was the very blood mage Hanks had been hunting!

"She's a woman?" Lucy recalled the fortune-teller Irene Powell had mentioned.

Hanks' eyes widened. "You can even tell that?"

Hank cut in proudly, "See? I told you Lucy was incredible!"

Lucy smiled faintly but said nothing, focusing on sensing the aura embedded in the talisman paper.

A short while later, a fresh tracking talisman was complete.

"Effective within 500 kilometers. Light it to activate," she handed it to Hanks. "Single use only."

"Payment in credits will do."

Hanks accepted it like a priceless treasure. "Thank you! Credits are definitely more valuable than cash."

By the time they parted ways, it was already late at night.

Back home, Lucy immediately dialed Vincent Powell's number.

"Master Lucy?" Vincent, who was reviewing documents, sounded surprised by the call.

"Still wearing the talisman?" Lucy got straight to the point.

"Always." Though the ghost marriage had been dissolved, the charm had proven effective.

Lucy didn't mention the blood mage, only saying, "Your cousin should be having nightmares by now. Be careful—he might get desperate."

"Tomorrow, I'll send a protective charm for your mother. Both of you need to be extra cautious."

She paused. "Better install surveillance at home. Contact me immediately if anything seems off."

After hanging up, Vincent arranged for security cameras to be installed the next day and went to warn his mother.

Meanwhile, Lucy dialed Ethan Smith's number.

A deep voice answered, "Calling so late?"

Water droplets slid down the man's sculpted abdomen as he casually towel-dried his damp hair, the corner of his lips curling upward unconsciously.
###Chapter 117: Don't Regret It

Lucy White recounted everything about the Powell family and the blood mage to Ethan Smith.

For some reason, she felt an inexplicable trust in him.

Besides, this matter involved the Special Operations Division, and providing intel was part of her duty.

Ethan wasn’t originally assigned to this case—it had been delegated to Agent Hanks by the deputy director. But since Lucy was involved, he decided to take charge personally.

"I’ll relay the intel on the Powells and the witch to Hanks so they can proceed with caution," he said, pausing briefly. "You’ll be notified as soon as we have results."

Lucy nodded. "Let me know if you need any help."

"Will do." A faint smile flickered in Ethan’s eyes.

Over the next two days, Lucy and Ethan coached the trainees in the rehearsal studio.

With the live performance approaching, tension ran high among the contestants.

Lucy’s team had the smoothest rehearsals, and everyone was confident.

Michael Johnson and Olivia Davis’s group, along with Robert Lee and William Jones’s team, were also progressing well.

Only Lily Green and Vanessa Knight’s team kept running into issues.

Though Vanessa disliked Lily, she kept her snide remarks minimal for the sake of the performance, reserving her real retaliation for the next livestream.

The problem was Lily herself—she insisted on taking both the vocal and dance center positions.

Vanessa refused, and the two argued endlessly.

After Lily’s public persona collapsed in the previous episodes, the other trainees had little patience for her.

When Vanessa suggested letting another contestant take the center spot, everyone voted in favor.

Furious, Lily half-heartedly went through the motions during rehearsals, resulting in a lackluster performance.

She secretly called Oliver Knight to vent.

Though she’d entered Morning Star Entertainment through Liam Parker’s connections, it was Oliver who secured her the best opportunities.

Liam remained oblivious to their secret affair.

After hearing Lily’s tearful complaints, Oliver’s resentment toward Vanessa deepened.

Any lingering guilt he’d felt about breaking off their engagement vanished—now, Vanessa was just being unreasonable.

"Don’t worry, I’ll handle it," he soothed.

Soon after, Morning Star Entertainment pressured the director to replace Vanessa.

In the past, the director wouldn’t have dared to defy Oliver.

But with Ethan backing him now, he stood his ground.

"Sorry, the guest lineup is finalized. No changes," he flatly refused.

When Oliver learned Ethan was involved, he had no choice but to back down—for now.

He arranged to meet Vanessa at an upscale restaurant.

Vanessa was already waiting in the private room when he arrived, elegantly pouring a glass of red wine.

"Try this. It’s your favorite vintage."

Oliver forced a smile and picked at his food.

"Vanessa, there’s something I need to discuss."

She set down her fork, dabbing her lips with a napkin. "Go ahead."

"Could you drop out of the show?" he asked bluntly.

Vanessa scoffed. "Or should I say—stop bothering your little mistress?"

Her gaze sharpened. "Don’t tell me you’re actually serious about that white lotus?"

They’d been engaged since childhood, and she’d always seen Oliver as her future husband.

She’d even fallen in love with him.

Until she discovered his affair with Lily.

"I’m sorry. I have feelings for her," Oliver admitted frankly.

Vanessa froze as if struck by lightning. "What did you just say?"

"Let’s call off the engagement," he said firmly. "Our joint project is wrapping up. It’s the perfect time."

Her face paled. "You’d throw me away for her?"

"Twenty years together, and you choose some two-bit actress?" Her voice trembled.

Oliver’s expression darkened. "Lily is a good person. Show some respect."

"And stop harassing her. I pursued her."

From the moment he’d first seen Lily, he’d felt an inexplicable pull—a sense of destiny Vanessa had never inspired.

Not to mention the unparalleled passion Lily brought to their intimate moments.

Vanessa clenched her napkin so tightly her nails dug into her palms.

Suddenly, she snatched her wineglass and hurled its contents into Oliver’s face.

"Fine, Oliver Knight! Break the engagement if you want!" Her voice shook with fury. "Don’t you dare regret it!"

Red wine dripped down Oliver’s face as he wiped himself off, glaring. "You’ve lost your mind!"

"I won’t regret a thing," he spat. "Lily is a thousand times the woman you are."

Vanessa fought back tears as she stormed out of the room.

She wouldn’t let anyone see her vulnerability.

Least of all the man who’d betrayed her.
###Chapter 118: Lucky to Have Met You

Vanessa Knight trembled with rage.

She pointed sharply at the door. "Get out!" Her voice shook with suppressed fury. "I never want to see you again."

Oliver Knight adjusted his cuffs leisurely. "Let's part ways amicably." His gaze was icy. "Stay away from Lily."

"Hah!" Vanessa scoffed. "You think you can control me after breaking up?" She clenched her fists. "That bitch—I'll beat her up every time I see her!"

Taking a deep breath, her eyes reddened. "And you, you cheating scum—I won’t let you off either."

Seven years of her youth, her family’s investments—all wasted on this man.

How dare he end things so casually?

Oliver’s expression darkened. "You’ve lost your mind."

"Watch yourself." With those final words, he turned and left without looking back.

The moment the door closed, Vanessa’s tears finally overflowed.

She bit her lip hard, refusing to let a single sob escape.

Half an hour later, she wiped her tears, fixed her makeup, and strode out of the restaurant in her heels.

Turning the steering wheel, she headed straight for her usual bar.

......

"Lucy, free tonight?" Emily’s voice came through the phone.

Lucy White was removing her makeup. "What’s up?"

"Want to grab drinks?" Emily sounded cheerful. "I haven’t been out in ages."

Lucy wiped off the last trace of eyeliner. "Sure, send me the address."

Thirty minutes later, the two settled into a corner booth.

Emily sipped her cocktail. "This feels amazing."

Just as Lucy was about to reply, she caught a familiar figure at the entrance from the corner of her eye.

Two men were dragging a woman in sunglasses toward the parking lot.

"Em, wait here." Lucy stood immediately.

She hurried outside just in time to overhear their conversation.

"Jackpot—it’s Vanessa Knight."

"Snap some photos. We can blackmail her later."

Lucy’s eyes turned cold. With a flick of her fingers—

"Ah! Ghost!" The men suddenly screamed and fled.

Lucy helped the unconscious Vanessa up and texted Emily.

"What’s going on?" Emily rushed over.

"Friend had too much to drink," Lucy explained briefly. "I’ll take her home."

After ensuring Emily left safely, Lucy took Vanessa to a hotel.

A sip of the talisman-laced water later, Vanessa jolted awake.

"Where am I?" She sat up in panic, relaxing only when she saw Lucy.

"Remember now?" Lucy handed her a glass of water.

As memories flooded back, Vanessa paled.

"Thank you," she whispered, voice trembling. "If it weren’t for you..."

Lucy patted her shoulder. "Don’t drink alone next time."

Vanessa nodded hard, tears falling again.

In that moment, she suddenly saw everything clearly.
###Chapter 119: Sweetest Revenge is Personal

Vanessa Knight's tears fell like scattered pearls, each drop landing on Lucy White's hand.

"I was hurting," she choked out. "So I went drinking."

"Never again." The night's events had shaken her to the core.

Lucy handed her a tissue. "You seemed fine this afternoon."

"Do you need help?"

Perhaps it was gratitude for being saved, or perhaps years of pent-up emotions—Vanessa suddenly felt the urge to confess.

She spilled everything about Oliver Knight.

Instinct told her Lucy could be trusted.

Listening to the story, Lucy smirked inwardly.

That scumbag again.

The plot had already deviated from the original story, and Vanessa's reaction was far more decisive than in the book.

"You did the right thing," Lucy said firmly. "The sooner you dump trash like that, the better."

"Imagine finding out after marriage—that would've been worse."

Vanessa curled into herself. "But I loved him for so long..."

"And he chose someone like Lily Green? How?"

It made no sense to her.

Lucy scoffed. "Proof he's blind."

Though influenced by the storyline, Oliver was rotten at his core.

Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson had resisted temptation—why couldn't he?

Vanessa clenched her fists. "I can't swallow this."

"Then don't." A glint flashed in Lucy's eyes. "Make them regret it."

Vanessa looked up, dazed. "But... I still love him."

Lucy saw her struggle.

If this continued, that toxic pair would manipulate her again.

"Get some sleep," Lucy said abruptly. "You'll have answers tomorrow."

Vanessa shook her head. "I can't."

Lucy embraced her gently. "Just close your eyes."

"Will you... stay with me?" Vanessa grasped her hand.

"Okay."

Under Lucy's soothing pats, Vanessa gradually drifted off.

Lucy rose, spiritual energy gathering at her fingertips.

A dream talisman took form silently.

She'd make Vanessa see the future.

Revenge was always sweetest when served personally.

After texting her mother, Lucy meditated cross-legged on the windowsill.

Moonlight bathed her in silver.

At dawn, Vanessa bolted upright.

Drenched in cold sweat—the dream had felt too real.

Her gaze swept the room, landing on Lucy asleep on the couch.

Everything had changed.

Had it all started with Lucy?

Suddenly remembering Lucy's fate in the dream, her heart clenched.

Could it be...?

Her eyes softened with newfound protectiveness.

Thank goodness they'd met.
###Chapter 120: Turning Point of Fate

Vanessa Knight stepped out of the shower, water droplets trickling down her hair. She towel-dried it roughly, her mind replaying that nightmare over and over.

"What a fool I was," she muttered through gritted teeth.

Oliver Knight, that scumbag, had destroyed her entire family just for a woman like Lily Green—someone with no loyalty. The image of her father dying in despair and her mother too ill to afford treatment flashed in her mind. Her nails dug into her palms.

"Not this time. I won’t make the same mistake again."

She took a deep breath and pushed open the bathroom door, just as Lucy White sat up from the couch.

"Why’d you sleep out here?" Vanessa asked, forcing a light tone.

Lucy rubbed her eyes. "Didn’t want to kick you."

"Feeling better?" Lucy asked, concern lacing her voice.

Vanessa gave a relieved smile. "I’ve figured it out. A scumbag and a gold-digger—they deserve each other. I should be glad I saw his true colors early."

She suddenly pulled Lucy into a hug. "Thanks for staying with me last night."

"Don’t mention it. That’s what best friends are for."

They exchanged a knowing smile, warmth passing between them. Vanessa silently swore to herself—this time, she’d protect the people who truly cared for her.

The rehearsal room pulsed with deafening music.

"Stop!" Lucy clapped her hands. "The third section isn’t synced. Again."

Sweat dripped down the trainees’ faces, but no one complained. With the live performance tomorrow, everyone was on edge.

At lunch break, Lucy announced, "Rest up this afternoon. Save your energy."

The trainees cheered and dispersed. Ethan Smith approached her. "Want to grab lunch?"

"Sure," Lucy agreed easily.

The private restaurant was tucked away in an alley, its antique decor exuding quiet elegance.

"The braised pork here is legendary," Ethan said, placing a piece in her bowl.

The meat melted on her tongue. Lucy’s eyes lit up. "It’s amazing!"

Ethan smirked. "Knew you’d like it."

Just then, his phone rang. After the call, his expression darkened. "Hanks messed up."

Lucy set down her chopsticks, unsurprised. "Let’s check it out?"

"Let’s go."

They left quickly, switching to a taxi as Ethan’s assistant drove off.

The rundown neighborhood flickered under dim streetlights.

Ethan pulled out two masks from his bag. "Better wear these. Public figures can’t be too careful."

Lucy took the red one, teasing, "You came prepared."

"Of course. For you, I always do." His voice held a smile as he adjusted his own mask.

Avoiding surveillance, they slipped silently into the complex.

"Hanks is up ahead," Ethan whispered.

Lucy suddenly grabbed his arm. "Wait. Something’s off."

A chill ran down her spine. Ethan immediately understood, and they slowed their steps.

"Still owe you for saving my life," he murmured.

Lucy chuckled. "You keeping score, Mr. Smith?"

"For you? Always." His tone turned serious.

Her heart skipped a beat. She quickly changed the subject. "You said you remembered more?"

"Yeah." His gaze deepened. "When the time’s right, I’ll tell you everything."

"Always so cryptic." She rolled her eyes but didn’t press further.

At the scene, Hanks paced anxiously. Spotting them, he rushed over. "He got away, but left this."

He handed over a yellowed talisman with eerie symbols.

The moment Lucy touched it, a sharp pain shot through her fingers. Her face paled. "It’s a trap!"

Thick fog erupted around them. Ethan yanked her behind him. "Stay close!"

From the mist, a sinister voice laughed. "Finally, Master Lucy…"
###Chapter 121: Extraordinary Indeed

The night was ink-black, and the building at the far end of the neighborhood loomed eerily under the moonlight.

Lucy White followed Ethan Smith into the stairwell when the motion-sensor lights flickered abruptly. She glanced up, a cold smirk curling her lips.

"Something's watching us," she murmured.

Ethan didn't slow his pace. "Her spies."

The door to the top-floor apartment stood wide open, as if inviting them in. Inside, three men stood waiting—Agent Hanks at the forefront.

"Director!" they greeted in unison.

Hanks' gaze landed on Lucy, surprise flickering in his eyes. The woman in the silver mask exuded an elusive aura of spiritual energy.

"And this is?"

"Moon," Ethan introduced tersely. "New colleague. Metaphysics expert."

The single-word codename made the three men exchange glances. In their line of work, such designations carried weight.

"Gold Three."
"Gold Five."
"Gold."

Each gave their own codename, their demeanor turning more respectful.

Lucy gave a slight nod. "Pleasure."

Ethan scanned the room. "Where is she?"

Hanks grimaced. "Gone again. The cup's still warm."

Lucy approached the coffee table, her fingertip brushing the rim of the glass. A wisp of dark energy slithered out—only for her to crush it between her fingers.

"She altered her signature," Lucy remarked coolly. "Clever."

She turned abruptly, digging into a flowerpot on the balcony and retrieving four porcelain dolls. Their faces bore eerie painted smiles, their bellies inscribed with directional characters.

"Four Corners Detection Spell," she said, tossing them onto the table. "No wonder you couldn't catch her."

Hanks' pupils constricted. "This is—"

"A method to detect righteous auras." Lucy swiftly drew four talismans, inscribing them before slapping one onto each doll's forehead. "Take these back for analysis."

Ethan looked at Hanks. "Mission transfer."

"Understood!"

As Lucy logged into the internal network, her eyes gleamed at the sight of a B-rank assignment.

"Interesting," she murmured. "This time, we'll be the hunters."

She didn't notice the faint amusement in Ethan's gaze as she turned away.

A gust of wind rushed through the window, rustling the talismans on the table. All four porcelain dolls suddenly opened their eyes—

[To Be Continued]
###Chapter 122: Drawing Out the Snake

Ethan Smith and Lucy White parted ways with Agent Hanks and his team at the gated community's entrance.

Not far away, in the community garden, a kindly-looking elderly woman sat leisurely beneath the shade of a tree. None of the passing residents noticed the subtle hand gestures concealed within her sleeves.

When she realized the porcelain doll she had enchanted couldn't be destroyed, her expression darkened instantly.

"Strange..." she muttered under her breath, unease creeping into her thoughts. After over a year of clashes with the Special Department, she knew their methods inside out. Blocking the spells within her doll and severing her connection to it—this was beyond their capabilities.

Had they enlisted outside help? The old woman narrowed her eyes and decided to retreat for now. Once she dealt with the Powell family, she would leave the capital immediately.

Just then, her phone rang abruptly.

After listening to the report, her grim expression softened slightly. She hastily ended the call following a brief agreement to meet in two days, then prepared to find a new hiding place.

Meanwhile, Ethan and Lucy found a blind spot away from surveillance. After confirming no one was around, they removed their masks.

"The handover is complete," Ethan said, glancing at Lucy. "Do we take the initiative, or wait for them to make a move?"

Lucy calculated briefly, a faint smile curling her lips. "Wait. The fish will take the bait within three days."

"Good. I trust your judgment," Ethan agreed without hesitation.

Lucy raised an eyebrow. "Director Ethan, you're quite comfortable delegating everything, aren't you?"

He chuckled. "It just means we work well together. From now on, you call the shots in the department. I'm happy to be your second-in-command."

"Tsk. Is the great actor Ethan Smith turning into a reckless ruler?" she teased.

"Serving Master Lucy is an honor," he replied smoothly, unfazed.

Before Lucy could retort, her phone rang. The caller ID showed Vincent Powell.

"Master Lucy! Someone's been through our house! My grandmother left something in my mother's and my rooms!" Vincent's panicked voice came through the line.

"I'll be right there." Lucy hung up decisively and flashed her phone at Ethan. "Seems the fish is even more impatient than we thought."

Ethan nodded in understanding. "Let's go."

They hailed a cab and headed straight for the Powell mansion.

Vincent and his mother, Irene Powell, greeted them at the door. Lucy briefly introduced Ethan, and though they were surprised by the actor's presence, their immediate concern was the mysterious objects left behind.

"Where were they found?" Lucy got straight to the point.

"The master bedroom and study," Vincent said, leading them upstairs. "We didn't touch anything—we waited for you."

Inside the master bedroom, Vincent approached the wardrobe. Carefully, he pulled open a drawer and moved aside the clothes, revealing two blood-red stones.

Lucy's eyes sharpened. "A vicious method."

"W-what are these?" Irene's voice trembled.

"Miasma stones," Lucy said grimly. "Nurtured in places of extreme darkness for at least a year, saturated with resentment. If left here for seven days, the occupants will meet with disaster."

Vincent sucked in a sharp breath. "They're trying to kill us!"

"Thank goodness we installed surveillance," Irene said fearfully. "Master Lucy, what should we do now?"

Lucy examined the stones closely. "There's a seal on these. Moving them carelessly would alert the caster."

"So you mean..." Vincent hesitated.

"Let them think their plan is working," Lucy said, a cold smirk playing on her lips. "I'll prepare some talismans to contain the dark energy without tipping them off."

Irene still looked uneasy. "But leaving these stones here..."

"Don't worry," Lucy reassured her, pulling out cinnabar and yellow paper. "My talismans will not only block the energy but also purify the room. Rather than living in constant fear, we'll draw the snake out of its hole."

Hearing this, mother and son finally nodded in agreement.

Lucy swiftly drew three talismans and affixed them to the drawers in the bedroom and study.

"Any other anomalies?" she asked as she put away her tools.

Vincent recalled, "The surveillance showed my grandmother searching for something. My secretary also went through my office at work."

A glint of cold determination flashed in Lucy's eyes. "They're looking for my talisman."

She handed Vincent a newly drawn protective charm. "Go to the office today and make sure your secretary sees this on you."

"You're planning to..." Vincent's eyes widened in realization.

"If they want to target me," Lucy said icily, "then they'll get exactly what they asked for."

Vincent clenched the talisman and nodded firmly. This time, he would stand with Master Lucy to end this threat once and for all.
###Chapter 123: Stage Explosion

The backstage buzzed with activity on the day of the live performance.

The draw was quickly decided. Lucy White's team would close the show, Robert Lee's group opened, Michael Johnson's team performed second, and Lily Green's took the third slot.

Under the "Wild Survival" theme, every group chose high-energy tracks.

Robert Lee's performance was decent but lacked fluidity in the choreography.

When Michael Johnson's team took the stage, the venue erupted. His commanding stage presence paired perfectly with Olivia Davis's flawless execution. The audience screamed, waving glow sticks wildly.

[Michael is so hot!]
[This team's chemistry is insane!]

Lily Green's group stepped up next, with Vanessa Knight stealing the spotlight with her signature smoky vocals. She cleverly minimized her weaker dance skills, turning them into a highlight.

But Lily, as usual, hogged attention. Positioned center stage, she exaggerated her moves, overshadowing her teammates.

Live comments exploded:
[Does Lily even know what teamwork means?]
[This is a group performance, not her solo act!]

The clash between her hired supporters and genuine fans left casual viewers unimpressed.

Finally, Lucy White's closing act began.

The moment the music started, the crowd went wild. Lucy abandoned her usual ethereal tone for a raw, magnetic voice, while Ethan Smith's deep bass sent shivers through the audience.

[Oh my god, that voice is lethal!]
[Ethan's low notes are unreal!]

During the dance break, Lucy spun sharply, her hair whipping through the air. Ethan matched her with crisp, powerful moves. Their synergy pushed the energy to its peak.

The most breathtaking moment came at the finale—Ethan suddenly lifted Lucy high, executing a daring mid-air rotation before landing perfectly.

The crowd's deafening screams nearly blew the roof off.

[That was so risky!]
[But damn, it looked amazing!]

Even more impressive was how Lucy and Ethan elevated their teammates. Jason Wright's rap brought the house down, while Lucas Young's solo dance earned roaring applause.

The ovation lasted long after their performance ended.

The results were predictable: Lucy's team took first, Michael's came second, Lily's placed third, and Robert's trailed last.

When eliminations were announced, Lily's team lost six members—a show record. Meanwhile, Lucy's group all advanced, with Jason skyrocketing to second place.

"Coach Lucy..." Noah Adams choked up, unable to speak. The once-bottom-ranked trainee now sat comfortably in the top fifteen.

Benjamin Harris's eyes reddened. "Without you, I'd have gone home ages ago."

Lucy hugged each trainee with a smile. "This was all your hard work."

As the eliminated members left, they glanced bitterly at Lily. Had she not monopolized the spotlight, things might have been different.

Backstage, Jason caught up to Lucy. "Coach, can I go for center position next round?"

She winked. "Keep this up, and it's yours."

Outside the studio, fans' cheers lingered. For many, sleep would be impossible tonight.
###Chapter 124: Do Whatever You Want

The eliminated contestants stood with ashen faces, their eyes burning with resentment.

"Should've joined Lucy's team," someone muttered under their breath.

"Being stuck with Lily Green is the worst luck," another contestant hissed through gritted teeth.

The two who advanced exchanged glances, relief evident in their expressions.

"Next time, please don’t pair me with Lily again."

The livestream chat exploded.

[Is Lily Green cursed? Everyone around her flops!]
[Her entire team got eliminated except two. Pathetic.]

Lily’s fans immediately jumped to her defense.

[Blame your own lack of skill!]
[If it weren’t for Lily, they wouldn’t even rank third!]

Neutral viewers had enough.

[Vanessa Knight carried that performance.]
[Lucy’s whole team advanced—now that’s real talent.]

On stage, Lily dug her nails into her palms, staring at the rankings displayed on the screen. The words "Third Place" burned her vision.

But what truly unsettled her was the sudden, inexplicable chill creeping through her veins—as if something vital was slipping away...

Lucy noticed the shift in Lily’s aura and smirked inwardly.

"The backlash has begun."

After the live performance, Lucy’s team swarmed her, buzzing with excitement.

"Lucy, let’s celebrate!"
"Ethan, you should come too!"

Lucy chuckled and glanced at Ethan. "You in?"

His eyes softened. "Your call."

The contestants gaped—since when was the notoriously aloof Ethan Smith this agreeable?

Ryan Clark booked an upscale BBQ restaurant, reserving the entire place.

"Tonight, we drink till we drop!" Jason Wright raised his glass.

Lucy, cheeks flushed from alcohol, suddenly pushed her drink toward Ethan.

"Ethan, cheers!"

He arched a brow, took the glass, and downed it in one go.

The contestants stared in shock.

"Ethan actually drank?"
"Only Lucy could pull that off..."

By midnight, the group staggered out of the restaurant, still riding the high.

A cool breeze brushed past as Lucy swayed slightly, her head spinning.

"I'll take you home," Ethan murmured beside her.

She squinted at him. "Sure."

Inside the elevator, he stepped closer.

"You hold your liquor well," Lucy tilted her head up, meeting his dark gaze.

Ethan chuckled lowly. "Trying to get me drunk?"

"And if I did?" Her ears burned.

He leaned in, breath warm against her skin. "Then do whatever you want."

"Jerk!" She punched his arm, face scarlet.

The elevator doors slid open, and Lucy bolted out—only for Ethan to catch her wrist.

"Easy," he sighed. "Don’t trip."

In the car, Lucy kept nodding off. Ethan gently guided her head to his shoulder.

"Sleep. I’ll wake you when we arrive."

She hummed drowsily, nuzzling against him before drifting off.

Ethan watched her peaceful expression, his gaze impossibly tender.
###Chapter 125: The Fish Takes the Bait

The driver wasn't Ethan Smith's assistant, but Old Wang, the chauffeur from the Smith family estate.

Hearing the young master's unusually gentle tone from the backseat, Old Wang's grip on the steering wheel faltered.

Good heavens, was this really the same cold-faced "King of Hell" young master?

Old Wang stole a glance through the rearview mirror and saw Ethan looking at his phone with a rare smile playing on his lips.

"Lucy, I'll be there soon."

The way he said "Lucy" sent shivers down Old Wang's spine.

Looks like the Smith family is about to have some happy news! Old Wang thought gleefully, already planning to report this to the butler the moment they arrived.

Meanwhile, the Smith estate was brightly lit.

Old Master Smith sat in the living room reading a newspaper, occasionally glancing at the clock.

"Sir, you should rest," the butler said, bringing him a cup of tea.

Old Master Smith waved him off. "Not yet. That rascal said he'd be back tonight."

Just then, the butler's phone buzzed.

"Sir! Wonderful news!" The butler's voice trembled with excitement. "The young master might be in a relationship!"

"What?" Old Master Smith shot to his feet, scattering the newspaper.

The butler beamed. "Old Wang just texted—the young master asked him to drive a young lady home. His tone was so tender..."

Old Master Smith slapped his thigh. "That boy! Finally came to his senses!"

As they spoke, the front door swung open, and Ethan strode in.

"Dad, why are you still up?"

Old Master Smith's eyes lit up as he hurried forward. "You rascal! Out with it—who's the girl?"

Ethan sighed, rubbing his temples. "Old Wang and his big mouth..."

"Don't change the subject!" Old Master Smith stamped his foot impatiently. "Are you two together or not?"

Ethan cleared his throat. "I'm still pursuing her."

"What? You haven't won her over yet?" Old Master Smith looked aghast. "Aren't you supposed to be some hotshot? Can't even handle one girl?"

Ethan chuckled helplessly. "It's not like buying groceries, Dad."

"I don't care!" Old Master Smith huffed. "I want to meet my future daughter-in-law next month, or don't bother coming home!"

Ethan massaged his temples. "Dad, these things take time..."

"Time? Your mother was already raising you at your age!"

Ethan: "..."

The butler stifled a laugh. After decades, their banter never got old.

"Alright, get some rest," Ethan said, steering the conversation away. "I promise to bring her home soon."

Old Master Smith finally nodded in satisfaction, then suddenly remembered something. "Wait—what's her name?"

"Lucy White," Ethan said, his lips curving unconsciously. "She's... special."

Seeing his son's expression, Old Master Smith's heart swelled with joy.

Late the next night, Lucy was reviewing a script when her fingers stilled.

Her head snapped up, eyes sharp.

"They're here."

She quickly dialed Ethan. "The fish took the bait. Head to the Powell residence now."

On the other end, Ethan was at a private club with his childhood friends.

"Sorry, urgent business." He stood to leave.

"Whoa, what's the rush?" David Wilson grabbed his arm. "Is this about that Miss White?"

Ethan arched a brow. "How'd you know?"

"It is!" The group erupted. "Give us details! How far along are you two?"

Ethan checked his watch. "Another time. Lives are at stake."

With that, he bolted out, leaving them stunned.

"Lives? That intense?"

Meanwhile, at the Powell villa.

Vincent Powell clutched his phone, sweat beading on his palms. "Master Lucy, please hurry! The house turned freezing—my mother and I both feel something's wrong..."

Lucy's voice was calm. "Stay put. We're coming."

Hanging up, she rushed to the door.

Ethan's car was already waiting. He opened the door as she approached.

"Status?" he asked grimly.

Lucy buckled in. "They're making their move tonight. We need to hurry."

The black sedan tore through the night toward the Powell estate.

Outside, dark clouds swallowed the moonlight.
###Chapter 126: Blood for Blood

Ethan Smith secured the silver mask over his face with slender fingers, his presence instantly becoming unreadable.

Lucy White gave a knowing nod. His identity as an A-list actor couldn’t be exposed—not when they were hunting a ruthless blood mage tonight.

The moment they stepped into the Powell family garden, a bone-chilling draft swept over them. Lucy narrowed her eyes, spotting tendrils of black mist slithering between the flower beds.

"Master Lucy!" Vincent Powell and his mother hurried forward, their gazes flickering uncertainly to the masked man.

"Colleague from the special division," Lucy said briskly.

Ethan gave a curt nod, his voice deliberately lowered. "Standard procedure."

Lucy strode to a corner and dug out two blood-red stones from a flowerpot. Their surfaces were etched with sinister patterns, cold enough to burn at the touch.

"Is this what’s been causing the trouble?" Vincent paled.

"Miasma stones." Lucy wrapped them in talisman paper. "Prolonged exposure drains vital energy."

After clearing every cursed stone from the house, the living room’s temperature finally normalized. Lucy suddenly turned toward the entrance. "No point hiding now."

The doors and windows flew open without wind, flooding the space with icy air. A hunched figure materialized, her wrinkled face framed by greasy gray hair.

"You?!" Irene Powell shot to her feet, nails digging into her palms.

Lucy’s sharp eyes caught the tangled threads of fate between the two women. "You know each other?"

"Know her?" Irene’s voice shook. "Her name is Mei Zhao. She was my father’s—"

"Lover?" The crone let out a shrill laugh. "That faithless bastard Liam Parker deserved worse!"

Her skeletal finger jabbed at the family portrait. "If he hadn’t rejected me, I wouldn’t have married that monster!" Her sleeve slipped, revealing grotesque scars along her wrist.

Lucy’s pupils constricted. The scars formed an occult sigil—a sacrificial mark.

"So you used blood magic to kill the Powells?"

"They deserved it!" Mei Zhao’s eyes turned bloodshot. "Liam would rather die than acknowledge me. I’ll wipe out his entire bloodline!"

She yanked her collar down, exposing a crimson curse mark over her collarbone. Lucy’s face darkened—a death hex sealed with kin blood.

"You sacrificed your own child?"

"It was dying anyway." The old woman cackled wildly. "Better to use it for vengeance!"

A gale howled through the room, chandeliers swinging violently. Lucy flung out talismans, her voice sharp. "You’ve taken more than four lives!"

"Of course." The crone licked her lips. "Practice makes perfect." She ripped open her coat, revealing a lining stitched with countless knotted strands of hair.

Each knot represented a murdered soul.
###Chapter 127: The Witch's Reckoning

"Disgusting!" I spat on the ground, glaring at Irene Powell's twisted, aged face with pure revulsion.

"If that heartless man wanted to die with that bitch, then I'll make sure the company he built with his life's work falls into the hands of the very people who murdered his daughter and grandson!"

"The best part?" Her voice grated like sandpaper as she sneered. "The bastard child you birthed will be the one to hand it over to them. How delicious!"

The old hag had come to settle scores today, laying all her cards on the table.

Her murky eyes suddenly locked onto me, venom dripping from her gaze. "And you—you meddlesome little wretch! If not for your interference, my plan would've succeeded long ago!"

"I wanted that faithless man to die in anguish! I wanted his daughter to suffer for eternity!"

Her scheme had been within reach—until I ruined everything. First, I altered the ghost marriage arrangement. Then I exposed Julian. Now even her cursed dagger plot had crumbled.

"Today, you die!"

Hearing her vendetta made my blood boil.

"What kind of twisted, shameless monster are you?" My hands trembled with rage. "Since when is not loving you a crime?"

"Look at yourself! No wonder no one wanted you!" I shot back without mercy. "You threw yourself at him, got rejected, and now you seek revenge? Pathetic!"

This lunatic was unbelievable. Blaming everyone else for her miserable life.

Her father rejecting this madwoman was the wisest decision he ever made!

The witch's face darkened. "You insolent brat! I was going to make your death quick, but now I'll ensure you suffer!"

"After you die, I'll mummify your corpse and torment you daily!"

I scoffed. "You think you can?"

"Your life force is in chaos. You should've died at fifty, but you've been stealing lives to prolong yours." I saw right through her. "No wonder you targeted those born under Yin years and months."

Irene gasped. "You're behind all those mysterious deaths in the village?"

"Of course!" The witch cackled. "Everyone who wronged me must die!"

She counted on her fingers: "Villagers who mocked me, my ex-husband's entire family, their relatives..." Her eyes gleamed with madness. "None were spared!"

Irene recoiled. This woman was utterly deranged!

"Enough talk." The witch suddenly grinned eerily. "Time to send you off."

She snapped open a wooden box, revealing an ancient dagger glowing with sinister light.

"Activate!" She bit her finger and smeared blood on the blade.

A chilling wind howled as the dagger levitated. The room plunged into suffocating darkness.

"Did you really think I'd waste time chatting?" The witch gloated. "I set this death trap the moment I stepped inside!"

Irene and Vincent clutched their throats, faces turning blue as if invisible hands strangled them.

Just as they neared unconsciousness, their protective charms burst into flames. They collapsed onto the sofa.

But I was prepared. With a flick of my fingers, I commanded, "Break!"

Seven golden beams shot through the windows, shattering the witch's array. The eerie wind vanished instantly.

"You—!" The witch paled. "When did you—"

"Just a step ahead." I smirked. I'd left countermeasures after dealing with the cursed stone.

Furious, she slapped a blood-stained talisman onto the dagger. The blade's malevolence exploded—nearby plants withered before our eyes!

"Die!" she shrieked.

The dagger shot toward my heart like a green bolt!

The witch's hair turned white, her face withering—she was burning her lifespan to power the cursed weapon!

I raised my compass to block it. This millennia-old blade reeked of death—if I could subdue it...

"Look out!" Irene and Vincent cried.

The dagger veered—straight for my throat!
###Chapter 128: Self-Inflicted Fate

The dagger gleamed coldly as it thrust toward Lucy White's heart. When it was mere inches away—

Clang!

A clear, resonant chime echoed through the air.

A streak of golden light shattered through the window, violently knocking the dagger aside.

Lucy's hand, still holding the compass, froze midair as she stared in astonishment at the hovering golden shortsword. Its blade shimmered with radiant energy, the aura of blessings so dense it seemed almost tangible.

"Almost evolving into a treasure-grade artifact?" She blinked, her lips curling into an unconscious smile.

Ethan Smith truly hid his depths well.

The sword was entwined with draconic energy and golden karmic light—evidence of years of intimate nurturing by its master. This method of cultivating a weapon with accumulated virtue was no ordinary feat for a practitioner.

In contrast, the old woman's cursed dagger, though vicious and menacing, lacked a true bond with its wielder. It could only sustain its power by feeding on her life essence.

Clash! Clang!

A green and a golden streak of light tangled midair, sparks flying.

Lucy's eyes sharpened. She released her compass, letting it join the sword in encircling the dagger.

Thud!

The old woman suddenly spat a mouthful of black blood, her skeletal finger trembling as she pointed toward the doorway. "Who—?!"

A masked man strode in, dragging the corpse of a meter-long centipede behind him. The creature's black exoskeleton glowed with an eerie crimson sheen.

"My precious!" The old woman's eyes bulged with fury. This was her blood-fed earth-burrowing centipede, her means of escape for years—now slaughtered.

Seizing the moment, Lucy completed her incantation. A spectral Eight Trigrams diagram materialized above her palm, enveloping several blood-red stones. The miasmic energy receded like a tide, surging back into the old woman instead.

"No—!" A piercing shriek tore through the villa.

The old woman's skin withered before their eyes, her body contorting as vengeful spirits coiled around her like venomous snakes. She collapsed, writhing, black blood seeping from her orifices.

"What's happening...?" Vincent Powell gaped.

"Karmic backlash." Though pale, Lucy's voice held grim satisfaction. "The resentment of those she murdered is returning to her."

Ethan moved swiftly, steadying her swaying form. "Are you hurt?"

"Just drained." She leaned into his arm, catching the faint scent of ambergris. "You arrived just in time."

Without that golden sword, she would have had to expend at least three life-saving talismans.

Ting!

A crisp snap rang out. The cursed dagger wailed as it fell, pinned beneath the compass. Its malevolent energy was slowly being purified by the golden light.

When Agent Hanks and the others burst in, they found the old woman convulsing like a broken doll, the golden sword hovering protectively near Lucy—and their director cradling their new colleague with a gaze soft enough to melt ice.

"This dagger..." Lucy wrapped the spoils in a talisman.

"It was always meant for you." Ethan's lips quirked. "It's waited many years."

A strange warmth flickered in Lucy's chest as she pocketed the blade. The moment her fingers brushed its cold surface, an odd sense of familiarity washed over her.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

The old woman suddenly let out a screeching laugh. "You think... this is over?" Her milky eyes burned with madness. "The Liu family graves—"

Before she could finish, her body dissolved into a pool of black ooze, leaving only her clothes behind.

"Blood Escape Technique!" Hanks paled.

Lucy and Ethan exchanged a glance, their gazes snapping toward the Liu ancestral estate. The night wind carried the faint metallic tang of blood—and the distant, anguished wails of the dead.

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 129: She Came for Lucy White

As Agent Hanks and his two colleagues escorted the old woman away, the eerie centipede was sealed in a specialized container for further study.

Before leaving, Ethan Smith whispered to Lucy White, "I need to report tonight's incident to the department. Let's have dinner another time."

Lucy nodded, watching them depart.

Vincent Powell helped his trembling mother Irene Powell to her feet, his voice choked with emotion. "Master Lucy, you saved our entire family."

The supernatural confrontation had left them shaken, and they now fully grasped Lucy's extraordinary abilities.

Lucy waved dismissively. "Handle the rest of your family affairs yourselves."

A ruthless glint flashed in Irene's eyes. "Those ungrateful traitors won't escape justice!"

When Irene insisted on compensation, Lucy handed her a list. "Just gather these medicinal herbs for me."

"Consider it done!" Irene clutched the list like a treasure—this was her chance to forge ties with a true master.

After leaving two protective talismans, Lucy took her leave.

The next day, retribution befell the Powell family.

Irene not only cut off their dividends but also ensured every Powell employed in the corporation lost their jobs.

Vincent immediately contacted the police. Surveillance footage revealed the secretary's assistant had entered his office.

In the interrogation room, the terrified assistant confessed everything, implicating Julian Powell as the mastermind.

Following the trail, authorities uncovered multiple crimes—embezzlement, corporate fraud—committed by Julian.

When the Powell matriarch led her family to protest at the company, security promptly ejected them.

Worse awaited them outside—police arrested the entire group for disturbing public order.

Upon their release from detention, Irene unleashed even fiercer retaliation.

Plagued by the unresolved ghost marriage curse, Julian suffered nightly nightmares in prison.

A month later, he collapsed in the cafeteria and never regained consciousness.

The Powell family crumbled completely, forced to liquidate their assets and relocate to a small town.

But Irene wasn't finished. She systematically severed all their financial lifelines.

These backstabbers valued money above all—so she condemned them to lifelong poverty!

Vincent smirked at the news before legally changing his surname.

If that wicked crone wanted the Powell line extinguished, he'd proudly bear his mother's name instead!

Three days later, Lucy received an audition notice.

Accompanied by her agent and assistant Sophia Taylor, she arrived at the studio to find the waiting area packed.

This xianxia drama boasted an impressive cast—the male lead was an award-winning A-lister, and every actress auditioning had notable credentials.

Lucy's entrance drew countless assessing glances.

Her recent reality show success had skyrocketed her popularity to near-celebrity status, marking her as prime competition.

"Ms. White is auditioning too?"

A saccharine voice rang out.

Lucy looked up to see Lily Green clinging to Patrick Young's arm.

Her lips curved. "Is this your production?"

Lily's smile stiffened. "I just didn't expect to see you here."

"Spare me the act." Lucy cut through the pretense. "You knew I'd be here."

Soft laughter rippled through the room.

Digging her nails into her palms, Lily stormed off, barely containing her rage.

She'd come specifically for Lucy!

Oliver Knight had promised her the female lead role—then let's see how high-and-mighty Lucy could act!

Imagining upstaging Lucy on set, Lily couldn't suppress a triumphant smirk.

Little did she know, she was walking straight into Lucy's carefully laid trap...
###Chapter 130: A Masterclass in Acting

The confrontation between Lily Green and Lucy White fizzled out without drama, leaving many onlookers secretly disappointed.

From a corner, hushed whispers floated through the air.

"Some people really think they're something special."

"Yeah, as if they don’t know their own place."

The snide remarks were clearly aimed at Lily.

Lucy frowned, irritated by the fickle nature of the crowd. She flipped open her script and focused on her preparation.

"Make way! Coming through!"

A commotion erupted at the entrance as four assistants ushered in a heavily made-up woman. One held an umbrella, another carried her bags, and the other two cleared a path—her entourage was impossible to ignore.

Lucy glanced up and recognized Tiffany Quinn, the industry’s notorious "privileged star."

Tiffany swept her gaze around the room with an air of superiority before zeroing in on Lucy. She strutted over and plopped down beside her.

"Well, if it isn’t our beloved 'pretty face with no talent,'" she sneered. "Studying the script?"

Lucy didn’t look up. "Do you need something?"

Tiffany scoffed. "Don’t waste your time. The supporting role’s already been decided."

Only then did Lucy lift her eyes, giving Tiffany a cold once-over. "Oh? Congratulations, then."

The jab hit its mark. Tiffany hated nothing more than insinuations that she relied on connections.

"You—!" She was about to snap when the audition assistant entered.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll now draw lots to determine the audition order."

Lucy drew number 11—a decently early slot. Lily got number 3, while Tiffany ended up with 96.

"Terrible luck!" Tiffany stomped her foot before turning to Lucy. "Switch with me."

Lucy didn’t even glance up. "No."

"You—!" Tiffany’s face darkened. "You’ll regret this!"

In the end, she bullied another minor actress into swapping and triumphantly claimed number 10.

The auditions began swiftly.

When Lucy’s turn came, she walked into the room with quiet confidence.

Director Jude Miller was massaging his temples, clearly worn out by the previous candidates.

"Which role are you auditioning for?" he asked wearily.

"The supporting role—Su Youling," Lucy answered.

Director Jude raised an eyebrow. "That’s a complex character arc. Can you handle it?"

"I’d like to try."

"Then perform the scene where she returns after her descent into darkness."

Lucy nodded, took a deep breath, and—

In an instant, her entire demeanor shifted.

Her once-clear eyes darkened with malice, her lips curling into a sinister smirk. Even her posture transformed from poised elegance to something languid yet dangerous.

"Three years apart, and yet you haven’t changed, Shixiong," she murmured, her voice dripping with icy venom—yet laced with something disturbingly intimate.

The screenwriter jolted upright. "This—this is exactly how I envisioned Su Youling!"

Director Jude was stunned. He’d expected Lucy to only pull off the character’s innocent early persona, but her portrayal of the corrupted enchantress was chillingly perfect. Every glance, every movement—flawless.

When Lucy finished, the room fell silent.

"Brilliant!" The screenwriter slammed the table in excitement. "That’s the essence of the character!"

Director Jude nodded reluctantly. "Unexpectedly impressive."

He’d been ready to cave to investor pressure, but now…

"Miss White, your performance was exceptional," he said seriously. "We’ll give it careful consideration."

As Lucy left the audition room, a faint smile touched her lips.

She knew—the role was already hers.
###Chapter 131: No Retreat

Lucy White finished her performance and lifted her gaze to the director’s table.

Director Jude Miller and the other two judges stared at her, their eyes alight with awe.

"Director Jude, was that sufficient?" she asked softly.

Jude seemed to snap out of his daze, a genuine smile spreading across his face. "Excellent. Now, let’s try the scene where Olivia Davis, after her descent into darkness, reunites with the male lead."

Lucy nodded calmly, instantly shifting into the persona of the enchantress. Her eyes narrowed slightly, her crimson lips parting as every glance radiated dangerous allure.

Jude’s pen slashed two bold lines across the casting list.

"Thank you for your performance, Ms. White. We’ll be in touch," he said, his tone noticeably warmer.

As Lucy stepped out of the audition room, all eyes in the waiting area turned toward her. She had stayed inside twice as long as anyone else—enough to raise eyebrows.

"What took you so long?" Tiffany Quinn blocked her path, her voice sharp with accusation.

Lucy gave her a cold once-over. "None of your concern."

"Feeling guilty?" Tiffany lifted her chin. "Don’t think lingering will steal my role."

Lucy smirked. "A good dog doesn’t block the road."

"You—!" Tiffany’s face twisted. "Just you wait!"

Without looking back, Lucy walked away. "Anytime."

Inside the audition room, the three judges were deep in discussion.

"Lucy is Olivia Davis!" the screenwriter exclaimed. "None of the others even came close."

The producer frowned. "But the investors—"

"I’ll handle them," Jude cut in. "It’d be a crime to pass up an actress like her."

Meanwhile, Lily Green’s phone rang.

"The female lead is yours," Oliver Knight said, amusement in his voice.

Lily gasped, covering her mouth. "Really? That’s wonderful!"

In the car, Nathan King could barely contain his excitement.

"Lucy, you were incredible! That role is yours for sure."

Lucy watched the scenery blur past the window. "Tiffany won’t back down easily."

"Don’t worry." Nathan’s expression hardened. "No one’s taking what’s yours."

The next morning, Nathan’s call came earlier than expected.

"Lucy, there’s a problem," he said grimly. "The investors want to meet you."

"Me?" Lucy arched a brow.

"Liam Parker’s interfering," Nathan muttered. "Lily’s already confirmed as the lead."

Lucy tapped her fingers against the table. "When’s the meeting?"

"Tomorrow afternoon." He hesitated. "Tiffany’s been spreading rumors that you bombed the audition."

Lucy scoffed. "Then let’s see what this benefactor has to say."

She was curious to see just what tricks they had up their sleeves.

In this game, she wouldn’t retreat an inch.
###Chapter 132: Hugo's Secret

The evening sun painted the clouds in shades of tangerine as Lucy White finished changing her clothes. Just then, her phone rang.

"Lucy, Director Jude changed the meeting time last minute. He wants to see us at seven tonight," Nathan King's voice came through the receiver. "I'm on my way to pick you up now."

Lucy glanced out the window. "Alright, I'll be ready."

After hanging up, she adjusted the loose strands of hair near her ears in the mirror. The reflection showed a young woman with delicate features, rosy lips, and a pale blue dress that made her skin glow like snow.

Nathan's car arrived right on time. He rolled down the window, his gaze lingering on Lucy for a moment. "You look stunning tonight."

"Thank you," she replied, sliding into the passenger seat. "Any idea why Director Jude rescheduled so suddenly?"

Nathan turned the steering wheel. "Word is it was Hugo Shaw's doing—the investor."

Lucy tapped her fingers lightly against the car window frame. Hugo Shaw—a name that carried weight in the industry. Liam Parker's brother-in-law, notorious for his playboy reputation.

The restaurant was located atop a five-star hotel. As the elevator doors opened, the glittering city skyline stretched beyond floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Right this way, Miss White," a waiter greeted respectfully.

Inside the private dining room, two men were already seated. Director Jude stood immediately to welcome them, but the man at the head of the table remained motionless, his gaze appraising Lucy with undisguised amusement.

"Mr. Shaw," Lucy greeted evenly.

Hugo's lips curled. "Miss White, you're even more captivating in person." His eyes roamed freely over her, his tone teasing. "No wonder you've charmed so many."

Nathan's expression darkened, but Lucy subtly pressed a hand to his arm before he could speak.

"You flatter me," she said smoothly, taking her seat. "Though I assumed this was a business meeting."

Director Jude cleared his throat awkwardly. "Right, right. Let's order first."

Throughout dinner, Hugo's attention never wavered from Lucy. When the final course was served, he abruptly set down his wineglass.

"Miss White, I'll be blunt," he said, leaning forward. "I'm quite taken with you. If you're willing, the supporting female role is yours. I can offer you even more opportunities."

The air in the room turned icy. Nathan's fists clenched, while Director Jude pretended to study the menu.

Lucy swirled her wineglass, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Are you proposing... a sponsorship arrangement?"

"You could call it that," Hugo said, spreading his hands. "I'm very generous with women."

"Pity," Lucy set down her glass and met his gaze directly. "I have no interest in secondhand men."

Hugo's expression darkened. "Excuse me?"

"I said," Lucy enunciated each word, "I don't engage with married men. Especially..." She paused meaningfully. "...ones who are still virgins."

Clink. Hugo's fork clattered onto his plate.

Director Jude and Nathan both gaped at Hugo, whose ears turned visibly red.

"Miss White," Hugo forced a composed tone, "that's not a joke to make lightly."

Lucy tilted her head. "The tan line from your wedding ring is still on your left hand, but your right middle finger has a long-term indentation from wearing another ring. That means you're married but pretending to be single."

Her gaze dropped lower. "And also—"

"Enough!" Hugo cut her off, his expression shifting unpredictably. After a beat, he suddenly chuckled. "Fascinating. Truly fascinating."

He downed his wine in one gulp. "I retract my earlier offer. However..." A sly glint entered his eyes. "I'll still block you from this role."

Unfazed, Lucy pulled out her phone. "That's fine. I happen to know a few friends interested in film investments."

She scrolled through her contacts and tapped one name deliberately. "For example... Liam Parker?"

Hugo's face froze.
###Chapter 133: Bullseye

Hugo Shaw's face darkened instantly. He hadn't expected Lucy White to see through his secret with just one glance.

The shocked looks from Director Jude Miller and Fang Yan made his skin crawl.

"Miss White," he said through gritted teeth, "some things are better left unsaid."

Lucy took a sip of tea, her red lips parting slightly. "Mr. Shaw, you started this."

Hugo choked, his chest tightening.

"I didn't know you had such skills," he admitted, then shot a warning glance at the director and his companion. "You heard nothing, correct?"

Both men shook their heads hastily, beads of sweat forming on their foreheads.

Satisfied, Hugo turned back to Lucy. "I apologize for earlier."

"Since you've figured it out," he lowered his voice, "you should know my 'sponsorships' are just a front."

Lucy toyed with her teacup, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"They say you can divine fortunes?" Hugo suddenly perked up. "How about reading mine?"

He added, "Get it right, and the supporting female role is yours."

"Divination isn't free," Lucy tapped the table lightly with her fingertips.

Hugo raised an eyebrow. "Meaning?"

"Masters charge for their services," Director Jude whispered.

"No problem." Hugo pulled out his wallet. "As long as it's accurate."

Lucy produced three ancient divination coins. "Blow on them three times."

Hugo complied, his gaze scrutinizing.

"What do you wish to know?" Lucy asked.

"Marriage and family health," Hugo said offhandedly.

As the coins landed, Lucy's eyes flickered. "Are you sure you want to hear this now?"

After the others left, Lucy cut to the chase:

"Mr. Shaw, your wife was unfaithful before your wedding."

Hugo's fingers clenched abruptly.

"You noticed something off on your wedding night, which is why you've never touched her."

"Yet she got pregnant soon after."

Lucy gave him a meaningful look. "So you started taking lovers—as revenge?"

The smirk froze on Hugo's face.

He stared at Lucy for a long moment before rasping, "Bullseye."

Memories flooded back—

The meticulously planned ceremony, the drugged groom, the eerie hypnotic suggestions...

When his therapist revealed the truth, his entire world had crumbled.

"How could you know this?" His voice trembled.

Lucy gathered the coins. "The divination never lies."

Hugo suddenly laughed, the sound edged with hysteria. "What a divination!"

He leaned in abruptly. "Then tell me, what do I want to do right now?"

The air in the private room turned to ice.
###Chapter 134: No Mercy Left

Hugo Shaw pieced together the clues, his stomach churning with disgust.

When he returned home, Penelope Shaw greeted him with a steaming cup of tea, her face adorned with a gentle smile. The picture-perfect image of a devoted wife and mother nearly made him vomit on the spot.

What a waste of talent. She should’ve been an actress.

That night, he feigned a headache to avoid sharing a bed, secretly observing her reaction. Sure enough, relief flickered in her eyes.

Too suspicious.

Determined to uncover the truth—and to stay as far away from her as possible—he called his overseas branch that same night. The next morning, he left the country under the pretense of urgent business.

A month later, when he returned, his parents greeted him with mysterious excitement.

"Penelope is pregnant!" his mother announced, overjoyed. "We’re going to have a grandchild!"

The news struck him like lightning. Not only had he been cuckolded, but now he was expected to raise another man’s child?

From that day on, he moved into the guest room, citing the need for Penelope to rest. Privately, he dispatched investigators to track down the man responsible.

Strangely, they found nothing.

Every attempt to tail Penelope led to dead ends, deepening his unease.

Though the child disgusted him, he had no intention of harming it. He would wait until the birth, demand a paternity test, and then expose the truth.

But two months later, Penelope "accidentally" took a fall—and just like that, the baby was gone.

At the hospital, she collapsed in hysterics, her grief so raw it almost seemed genuine.

He demanded the embryo for testing, but the hospital claimed it had already been disposed of. The speed of its removal was suspiciously convenient.

To make matters worse, the Shaw-Parker joint venture had reached a critical phase, forcing him to swallow his fury for the time being.

Watching Penelope drown in crocodile tears made him sick. In retaliation, he began frequenting nightclubs, deliberately allowing paparazzi to snap photos of him with different women.

The tactic worked. Penelope erupted in fury, even assaulting the alleged "mistresses" in public.

But he saw right through her. This wasn’t love—it was pure possessiveness. She couldn’t stand the thought of someone else touching what she considered hers.

So he escalated, flaunting his affairs with even more brazenness.

As for the women who got beaten? He couldn’t care less.

They knew he was married. If they were willing to chase his money, they could handle the consequences.

He paid them handsomely and ensured they were compensated afterward. Money came with strings attached.

Within a year, Penelope transformed from a poised socialite into a shrieking, unhinged harpy.

Perhaps this was her true nature all along.

When he filed for divorce, she refused outright, running back to her family in protest.

The Parkers feigned sympathy, dismissing his affairs as mere "business entertainment"—but divorce was out of the question.

Disgusted but lacking concrete evidence, he was temporarily at a loss.

His only option was to keep digging for the mystery man. His instincts screamed that the Parkers were hiding something far worse.

He hadn’t even confided in his parents—yet Lucy White saw through it all at a glance.

"Can you identify the man?" he pressed.

Lucy shook her head. "I’d need to meet your wife first."

"What else can you tell me?"

"You’ve been cursed," she stated bluntly. "If not for your family’s accumulated karma shielding you, the Shaws’ fortune would’ve been stolen long ago."

She paused. "But your protection is nearly depleted. If this isn’t resolved, disaster awaits."

The Shaws’ ancestral merits had led him to her today.

Hugo paled. "Someone is trying to steal my family’s fortune?"

Before Lucy could answer, her phone rang.

Irene Powell.

Stepping outside, she answered.

"Master Lucy, have you crossed Liam Parker?" Irene cut straight to the point.

"Only his woman," Lucy admitted.

"No wonder," Irene murmured. "He just called, demanding I cut off your herbal supplies."

She hurried to clarify, "Our families may share distant ties, but we’ve long severed contact. I’m warning you—Liam is ruthless. Be careful."

"Thank you, Aunt Irene." Lucy meant it.

Returning to the private room, she found Hugo waiting anxiously.

"Someone is siphoning your fortune," she confirmed, sitting down. "And they’re using marital bonds to do it."

Her gaze sharpened. "Look into the Parkers’ married daughters. See if their husbands’ families have all fallen into ruin."

Hugo immediately called his assistant to investigate.

While they waited, Lucy suddenly asked, "Why the sudden offer to sponsor me?"

"Liam suggested it," Hugo admitted. "He knew about Tiffany Quinn competing with you for that role. Said you were far more beautiful and that I should switch targets."

He shrugged. "Since I was already investigating the Parkers, I played along to see his angle."

"Of course, if you’re unwilling, I’d never force you," he added. "Those women all came willingly. I’ve never coerced anyone."

Lucy smirked coldly.

Lily Green’s handiwork again.

Since Liam Parker had delivered himself to her doorstep, she wouldn’t hold back.

No mercy left.
###Chapter 135: The Feng Shui Trap

Hugo Shaw's assistant worked with remarkable efficiency, calling back in less than ten minutes.

"Mr. Shaw, we've found something," the assistant said, his tone grave. "The situation with the Powell family is... unnatural."

Hugo's grip on the phone tightened. "Explain."

As the assistant relayed the details, Hugo's expression darkened. By the time he hung up, his face was stormy.

Lucy White idly spun an ancient divination coin on the table before looking up. "Well?"

"You were right about everything." Hugo exhaled sharply, his voice laced with suppressed fury. "Every daughter married off from the Powell family—their husbands' families met with disaster."

Some lost their patriarchs to sudden accidents. Others saw their businesses collapse one after another. The few who didn't go bankrupt still fell from elite status into obscurity.

One or two cases could be coincidence. But every single marital alliance ending this way? That was no accident.

A sudden realization made Hugo go pale. "Master Lucy, my grandparents' health—"

"It's from having their life force drained," Lucy confirmed. "When fortune is siphoned away, the consequences range from financial ruin to death."

She calculated silently. "Your grandfather only suffered a concussion this time. Next, it could be a stroke. Your grandmother's heart condition will soon escalate to cardiac arrest."

"And after that..." Lucy paused. "Your parents will be next."

Hugo clenched his fist so hard the teacup in his hand creaked under the pressure.

"Six months ago," Lucy said abruptly, "the curse on you intensified."

Hugo's pupils contracted. Six months ago—he'd had a vicious fight with Penelope after his infidelity came to light. She'd sworn through gritted teeth that he'd pay for it...

"Master Lucy, can this curse be broken?" His voice trembled slightly.

"Yes, but it won't be easy." Lucy tapped the table with a fingertip. "The Powells have a formidable expert backing them. Directly dismantling the array is too risky."

She met Hugo's gaze. "You must undo the knot tied by the one who made it."

"You mean—"

"First, let the other victimized families learn the truth." A sharp glint flashed in Lucy's eyes. "Sever the marital ties binding the Powell daughters. Cut the connections, and the array weakens."

Hugo understood immediately. "I'll contact them at once."

"Once the array is broken, will our stolen fortune return?"

"Some of it will," Lucy said. "Not enough to restore your families to their former glory, but sufficient for the next generation to rebuild."

Her voice turned icy. "Leave it unchecked, and your descendants will remain nothing but fuel for the Powells' greed."

A chill ran down Hugo's spine. The thought that he'd nearly doomed his family deepened his hatred for the Powells.

"They'll pay for this," he growled. "Guide me, Master Lucy."

Lucy's lips curved slightly. "First, rally all the victims to confront the Powells. Ruin their reputation and connections."

"When their fortune wanes, I'll dismantle the array." The coin on the table suddenly stood upright, spinning in a slow circle. "Then, it'll be the Powells' turn to taste the backlash."

Hugo nodded solemnly. "I'll follow your instructions."

"One more thing." Lucy gave him a pointed look. "Cut ties with those... distractions."

Hugo coughed awkwardly. "Understood."

Since seduction tactics hadn't worked on Penelope, there was no point continuing the charade. Preserving the Shaw family's fortune was now his priority.

Outside the window, a dark cloud drifted across the sun.


###Chapter 136: A Slap in the Face

Lucy White and Hugo Shaw exchanged contact information. Just as she tucked her phone away, Director Jude Miller and Nathan King walked into the room.

After the dinner concluded, Hugo personally opened the car door for Lucy, watching her van drive off before turning to leave.

"Did it work?" Nathan glanced at Lucy through the rearview mirror, unable to hide his surprise. In the span of a single meal, Hugo's attitude toward her had completely changed.

Lucy nodded lightly. "Yes." She paused. "But Tiffany Quinn won’t let this go. Keep an eye out, Nathan."

Nathan scoffed. "Without Hugo backing her, she’s nothing."

The next day, Director Jude officially announced the audition results.

Tiffany was at a spa when her agent called. Hearing that Lucy had landed the supporting role, she jerked upright, her face mask crumpling.

She immediately dialed Hugo’s number, only to be met by his assistant. The man coldly handed her a termination contract and a check.

"I won’t sign!" Tiffany threw the papers on the floor. "I want to speak to Hugo!"

The assistant picked them up without expression. "He said if you keep making a scene, the check disappears too." He lowered his voice. "If you still want a career, be smart about this."

Gritting her teeth, Tiffany signed, her nails digging into her palms.

That night, her assistant whispered that Lucy had dined with Hugo. Tiffany’s eyes burned with fury. "That bitch! She must’ve seduced him!"

Her assistant leaned in with a suggestion. A smirk curled Tiffany’s lips as she posted on Weibo:

@TiffanyQuinnV: The power of money is terrifying. Some people steal roles with their sugar daddies, while small-time actors like me just have to accept it. #ShowbizDirtySecrets

At first, the tweet went unnoticed—until Oliver Knight’s influencer accounts reposted it, unleashing a flood of trolls.

Soon, "eyewitnesses" claimed to have spotted Lucy and Hugo at a hotel, sharing carefully cropped photos.

[WTF! Lucy is Hugo’s mistress?]
[No wonder she stole the role—she’s got a sugar daddy!]
[Homewrecker! Hugo’s married!]
[Boycott unethical actors! How blind is Director Jude?]

The scandal exploded. #LucyTheMistress rocketed to the top of trending.

Nathan watched the hate comments multiply, rubbing his hands anxiously. "Should we clarify now?"

But Lucy calmly scrolled through her feed. "Wait. Let the fire burn a little longer."

When the backlash peaked, Director Jude dropped three audition clips. The internet erupted.

[Her acting is insane! That villainous breakdown gave me chills.]
[Tiffany calls herself a serious actress? She can’t even remember her lines!]
[Director Jude knows talent! Can’t wait for Lucy’s dark sorceress!]

Trolls scrambled:
[Good acting excuses being a mistress?]
[Disgusting morals! Ban her!]

Then Hugo stepped in, posting Tiffany’s termination contract. He detailed the truth and released full surveillance images proving it was a four-person dinner.

Next, Tiffany’s past was exposed—stealing her best friend’s husband, sleeping with wealthy businessmen, tantrums on set—each accusation backed by irrefutable proof.

Netizens were stunned:
[This plot twist is wild!]
[Tiffany’s the real homewrecker!]
[Poor Lucy, dragged into this mess for no reason.]

Within two hours, Tiffany went from "victim" to public enemy, her scandal surpassing a billion views.

Meanwhile, Lucy’s followers skyrocketed by a million overnight.
###Chapter 137: An Unexpected Twist

Tiffany Quinn's name exploded across the trending list.

[What the—this plot twist came out of nowhere! Tiffany just hit rock bottom.]

[She played the mistress and then pinned the blame? Disgusting.]

[Lucy White’s acting is next-level. I rewatched that audition clip three times!]

[Tiffany Quinn, get out of the entertainment industry!]

Public opinion flipped overnight. Tiffany was swiftly blacklisted by her agency and fled the capital before dawn.

Meanwhile, Lucy’s acting skills became the talk of the town, her xianxia drama audition clip spreading like wildfire.

Director Jude Miller couldn’t stop grinning—this free publicity was a goldmine.

But soon, the conversation took another sharp turn.

[What was Hugo Shaw thinking? He had a perfect wife at home!]

[Penelope Shaw is leagues above those mistresses.]

[Confirmed: the man’s trash.]

Hugo’s expression darkened as he scrolled through the comments.

"The Parker family’s spinning the narrative," he muttered coldly before instructing his assistant, "Terminate all sponsorship contracts."

That afternoon, a bombshell headline dropped:

#Penelope Shaw Caught Cheating During Marriage#

The internet erupted.

[What kind of soap opera is this?!]

[So Hugo’s ‘sponsorships’ were just leverage for divorce?]

[Rich people drama is wild…]

Penelope quickly posted a tearful video response: "Hugo’s slandering me!"

Hugo retaliated by releasing the sponsorship contracts—clearly stating no physical intimacy permitted.

"I just wanted a divorce," he wrote on his social media.

At the Parker estate, Penelope shredded the divorce papers with a shriek.

"Divorce? In your dreams!" she screamed. "You’re stuck with me for life!"

Hugo trembled with rage. "You’ll regret this."

Hanging up, he immediately called Lucy.

"Master Lucy, I need your help."

Over dinner, Lucy set down her chopsticks. "Go on."

After hearing him out, she nodded thoughtfully. "Send me the surveillance files."

Ten minutes later, she pinpointed the key detail.

"Come get a talisman," she texted a location. "Have your people carry it at all times."

Hugo’s eyes lit up. "On my way."

Meanwhile, Penelope sped toward a secluded villa—unaware that this time, her true colors would be exposed.
###Chapter 138: I've Always Had Faith in You

Lucy White had just ended the call, her fingers lingering on the phone screen. She turned to Ethan Smith beside her and recounted the Shaw family's situation.

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly as his long fingers tapped rhythmically against the table. "The Parkers would dare use such underhanded methods?" His voice was low, edged with coldness.

"I'll report this to the Special Division and the Metaphysical Society immediately," he added, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.

Lucy blinked. "Metaphysical Society?" The name was unfamiliar to her.

Noticing her confusion, Ethan patiently explained, "It's the authoritative organization in the metaphysical arts, founded by masters from both Taoist and Buddhist traditions."

He took a sip of tea. "Beyond academic exchange, they assist official agencies in handling supernatural cases."

Lucy's eyes brightened. "That sounds fascinating."

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. "With your abilities, it won't be long before they extend an invitation." He paused. "The society exists to maintain order in our field."

Their conversation was interrupted by a soft knock at the private room's door.

Hugo Shaw entered but froze mid-step upon seeing Ethan. Surprise flickered across his face before he bowed respectfully. "Master Lucy, Mr. Smith."

Lucy noted how Hugo's demeanor toward Ethan was unusually deferential, almost reverent. It only deepened her curiosity about Ethan's background.

"Mr. Shaw," Ethan acknowledged with a nod, his posture relaxed.

Hugo ventured cautiously, "I didn't realize you two were acquainted?"

"Friends," Ethan replied succinctly, making Hugo's eyes gleam with sudden understanding.

Lucy smoothly redirected the conversation. "Mr. Shaw, did you bring what we discussed?"

Hugo hastily produced an exquisite necklace. Lucy accepted it, retrieving a sheet of talisman paper from her bag. Her fingers moved deftly as she inscribed a sigil.

"Have the person being followed wear this," she instructed, handing him the completed talisman. "And switch out your surveillance team."

Hugo accepted it like a priceless treasure. "Thank you, Master Lucy." With practiced tact, he excused himself. "I won't intrude further."

Once Hugo departed, Lucy arched a brow at Ethan. "You know him?"

"We've crossed paths at family gatherings," Ethan dismissed lightly.

Afternoon sunlight streamed through the car windows as Ethan turned the steering wheel. "How's the script coming along?"

Lucy lifted her chin confidently. "I've thoroughly analyzed the female lead's character."

Ethan glanced at her, amusement dancing in his eyes. "I've always had faith in you."

The car eventually stopped before a traditional courtyard house. At the stone table in the yard, a vigorous middle-aged man sipped tea.

"You're here," Director Maurice Ford said, his piercing gaze assessing Lucy.

Ethan made introductions. "Director Ford, this is Lucy White."

"An honor," Lucy greeted with poised courtesy. She hadn't expected Ethan's promised audition to be for Maurice Ford's new production.

The director set down his teacup, giving Ethan a meaningful look. "Anyone personally recommended by Mr. Smith deserves close consideration."

Ginkgo leaves rustled overhead as if bearing witness. Drawing a steadying breath, Lucy knew—her opportunity had arrived.
###Chapter 139: A Stunning Performance

Lucy White’s fingers trembled slightly as she held the script—its weight far heavier than she had anticipated.

Director Maurice Ford at the helm, with the legendary actor Ethan Smith joining the cast—this golden combination was nothing short of explosive in the industry. Once the news broke, the entire entertainment world would be shaken.

"Have a seat, Lucy." Director Maurice adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, studying her for a moment.

Lucy wore a simple cheongsam that accentuated her delicate curves perfectly. The director nodded inwardly—her figure would indeed carry the elaborate costumes required for the role.

"You flatter me." She sat gracefully, her fingertips lightly brushing the script’s title page.

This was a film she had never heard of in her past life. Yet Maurice and Ethan had been quietly preparing for it all this time.

"Tell me your thoughts on the female lead," Maurice said, handing her a cup of tea.

Lucy took a sip, her gaze deepening.

"She’s a woman living behind masks," she said softly but firmly. "By day, she’s a discarded wife, trampled upon. By night, she’s a queen who dominates the business world."

A spark of excitement flashed in Maurice’s eyes. Exactly what he wanted.

"Come, let’s do the audition." He stood abruptly.

In the courtyard next door, the crew was already waiting. The makeup artist, Cindy, stepped forward, her eyes lingering on Lucy’s face.

"Your complexion is flawless, Ms. White," she said with a smile, leading the way. "Today, we’ll give you a vintage look."

Two hours later.

Lucy emerged in embroidered slippers, her hair pinned low, her brows carrying a hint of sorrow—the perfect image of a forsaken noblewoman.

"Action!"

Before the camera, Lucy’s eyes reddened, but she stubbornly refused to let the tears fall. Trembling, she accepted the divorce letter, then turned away with her back straight.

"Cut!" Maurice slammed the table in excitement. "That’s the energy I wanted!"

The second scene was even more breathtaking.

Now in an emerald-green cheongsam, her lips a bold red, Lucy reclined lazily on a leather sofa, a slender cigarette holder between her fingers.

"You want this shipment, Young Marshal?" She smirked. "Then pay more."

Ethan, playing the young warlord, narrowed his eyes. The tension between them crackled in the air.

When the final shot ended, the room fell silent.

"Perfect!" Maurice was the first to applaud. "Lucy, you’re the leading lady I’ve been searching for."

Ethan walked over, a gentle smile in his eyes. "I told you she wouldn’t disappoint."

Lucy exhaled quietly in relief. She knew—her time had finally come.
###Chapter 140: Ethan's Cunning Scheme

Director Maurice Ford raised an eyebrow at the undisguised pride in Ethan Smith's voice.

Having known Ethan for years, this was the first time he'd seen the top-tier actor take such an interest in someone from the industry. Clearly, the renowned actor had ulterior motives when it came to Lucy White.

No wonder he'd personally arranged for her to join his production.

Maurice smiled faintly. "If you vouch for her, I trust your judgment."

"Lucy's performance was extraordinary—she's a natural-born actress."

Turning to Lucy, he advised earnestly, "Focus on acting instead of reality shows. That's where your future lies."

With her talent and Topaz Entertainment's backing, becoming an A-lister was only a matter of time.

Ethan immediately countered, "Acting and variety shows aren't mutually exclusive. A balanced schedule enhances creativity."

No way was he letting Lucy give up reality shows—how else would he get chances to be near her?

Maurice's lips twitched.

Wasn't this the same man who'd once called variety programs "mind-numbingly dull"? Now he was throwing principles out the window to chase a girl.

"Exploring different opportunities is good for young artists," he conceded reluctantly, though internally he lamented: Wasting such potential on frivolous entertainment is criminal!

"Still, I'd advise prioritizing acting," Maurice couldn't resist adding. "With your gift, an Academy Award is within reach."

Lucy smiled gracefully. "Thank you, Director. I'll do my best."

Reborn with a second chance, reaching the pinnacle of the entertainment industry was her ultimate goal—the dream she'd failed to achieve in her past life.

Maurice grew more impressed by the minute. Humble yet poised, she stood out among young actors. This one had limitless potential.

"So Lucy gets the lead?" Ethan pressed.

Maurice shot him a look. "Was that ever in doubt?"

To Lucy, he said, "Have your agent come sign the contract."

"Of course."

"We start shooting in four months—schedule clear?"

"Perfect. My xianxia drama wraps in three."

Maurice nodded. "Director Jude's productions are solid. Its release will build hype for our film."

He planned to announce the casting after Lucy's drama aired, leveraging its popularity while preempting skepticism about an unknown lead.

"Pleasure working with you." Maurice extended his hand.

Lucy shook it firmly. "I won't let you down."

When she excused herself to the restroom, Ethan asked casually, "Have you cast the male lead yet?"

"Still looking. High standards, few qualify." Maurice eyed him. "Another recommendation?"

"Michael Johnson would be ideal."

Maurice nearly choked on his tea.

Lucy's childhood sweetheart and ex-boyfriend?

Damn, Ethan plays dirty.

"He's a top-tier celebrity. Would he accept a supporting role?"

Ethan smirked. "Mention it's opposite Lucy, and he'll agree."

Maurice shook his head. "Poor Michael never stood a chance against you."

"Fine, I'll reach out."

Ethan's smile deepened.

When Lucy returned, Maurice invited them to dinner, but Ethan declined.

Who'd waste this rare alone time with a third wheel?
###Chapter 141: Was This Your Plan All Along?

The black SUV glided smoothly along the return route.

Ethan Smith's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest when he suddenly spoke, "Director Ford mentioned they're still struggling to cast the male lead's best friend."

Lucy White looked up from her phone with a questioning hum.

"I recommended someone," Ethan turned to meet her gaze, his expression open.

Understanding dawned immediately. Lucy arched an eyebrow. "Don't tell me it's Michael Johnson?"

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted. "He does fit the role perfectly." His measured tone continued, "Young, talented, and easy on the eyes."

Lucy burst into laughter. "Ethan, are you serious?" She tilted her head, studying him. "This feels intentional."

"Perhaps a little," Ethan admitted freely. His gaze deepened. "I want him to understand some opportunities don't come twice."

Lucy blinked. "Did Director Ford agree?"

"He thought Michael was ideal." Ethan paused. "If you're uncomfortable, I can have him reconsider."

Lucy waved a hand. "It's fine by me. His choice." She'd reached a point where Michael no longer unsettled her.

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes. "He'll accept."

"Then let him." Lucy shrugged nonchalantly.

Ethan glanced out the window. "Free for dinner? I know an excellent seafood place."

"Sure!" Lucy agreed readily. With her mother and brother traveling, she had no family commitments.

Checking his watch, Ethan added, "We've time. Would you accompany me to select cufflinks?"

Lucy raised an eyebrow. "The great Ethan Smith shops for himself?"

"Occasionally," he deadpanned.

Masked and capped, they moved through the mall with discreet harmony. Lucy helped choose several elegant cufflink sets while Ethan patiently waited during her dress fittings.

"Most men hate shopping with women," Lucy remarked.

Ethan took her bags effortlessly. "With you, it's no chore."

"Should I call you for all future shopping trips then?" Lucy teased.

"At your service." His eyes crinkled with humor.

Passing a cinema, Ethan suggested, "Care for a movie? This one's getting good reviews."

Lucy agreed, opting for VIP seats. In the darkened theater, Ethan held the popcorn, offering it periodically.

After the credits rolled, they arrived at an intimate seafood bistro. Their order just placed, three distinctively styled men entered the private dining room.

"Well, well," drawled a man with mischievous eyes. "Ethan Smith on a date? The world must be ending."

Ethan remained unflustered. "Hunter Wilde, Evan York - my childhood friends. You know David Wilson." He emphasized, "This is Lucy White."

Hunter whistled appreciatively. "Good taste, old friend." At Ethan's warning glance, he straightened. "Ms. White, we've heard so much about you." His meaningful look at Ethan continued, "No wonder you've been ignoring our calls."
###Chapter 142: The Oracle

Hunter Wilde's call came while Ethan Smith and Lucy White were watching a newly released film in a private theater. Both phones were silenced, so neither noticed the incoming call.

After the credits rolled, Ethan glimpsed Hunter's dinner invitation in their group chat. Deeming it unimportant, he didn't respond.

Fate had other plans—they ran into each other at the restaurant.

"Had my phone silenced this afternoon," Ethan explained casually, his gaze sweeping over the trio. "How'd you find us here?"

Hunter grinned, thumbing his own chest. "Spotted your back when we entered. Got your booth number from the host." They frequented this establishment and knew the owner well.

Ethan nodded. "Rain check."

The dismissal couldn't have been clearer.

The three men exchanged glances. Since when did Ethan prioritize romance over friendship? The old Ethan would've invited them to join immediately.

Evan York tactfully tugged Hunter's sleeve. "Sure, next time." Best not interfere with the man's pursuit—unless they wanted future retaliation.

David Wilson's gaze lingered on Lucy. He'd initially admired the woman who'd saved Ethan, especially after his sister Emily's glowing reviews. But since his friend had staked his claim, David knew better than to intrude.

"We'll leave you to it," he said with polished courtesy.

Hunter turned to go, then froze at David's address. "Master Lucy?"

"Miss White is a metaphysics expert," David clarified. "She saved Emily."

Hunter's eyes lit up as he plopped into the seat opposite Lucy. "You can really do divination?"

Lucy's lips curved. "Can't speak for others, but I can." She studied Hunter briefly. "As a courtesy to Ethan, I'll give you one reading."

"If provoked today, walk away. Otherwise—" her fingertip tapped the tabletop, "—blood calamity."

Hunter scoffed. "Seriously?"

"Your choice to believe." Lucy speared a slice of sashimi with deliberate grace. "If bottles start flying, protect your head."

"Alright, I'll play along." Hunter rose with a dismissive chuckle, winking at Ethan. "Later!"

"Remember her words," Ethan said suddenly.

Hunter waved him off, thinking love truly made men irrational.

After they left, Ethan asked, "How bad?"

"Minor injuries." Lucy accepted the shrimp he'd shelled. "A scratch at worst."

Ethan nodded. The idiot could use some humbling.

As seafood dishes arrived, Lucy's eyes crinkled with delight. "Ethan, you're a secret gourmet, aren't you?"

"Know a few decent places." He cracked a crab claw. "I'll take you next time."

Accepting the crabmeat, Lucy felt an odd warmth. Since their island ordeal, Ethan treated her with inexplicable familiarity that put her at ease.

Their meal concluded with another knock.

Hunter reappeared, sporting a bloody scratch and bandaged arm.

Ethan arched a brow. "Couldn't resist?"

"That bastard Felix Von started it!" Hunter grimaced, then turned shining eyes to Lucy. "You're psychic!"

At the restroom, his rival had provoked him. When Hunter retaliated verbally, the man smashed a bottle—but thanks to Lucy's warning, he'd shielded his head, taking only an arm wound.

"Sent the jerk to jail already." Touching his injury, Hunter fixed Lucy with an intense stare. "Oracle, another reading?"
###Chapter 143: Blood Calamity

Ethan Smith rubbed his temples as he watched Hunter Wilde's antics.

"Lucy White's expertise in metaphysics even impressed my grandfather," he said sternly. "You'd better take her words seriously."

Though Hunter was only a few months younger, he acted like an overgrown child. By family hierarchy, all their childhood friends had to address Ethan as "uncle," so he'd always treated Hunter like a younger brother.

Hunter hated when Ethan lectured him with that serious expression. He quickly forced a smile. "Got it, got it."

"It's just my first time dealing with something like this," he scratched his head. "Next time I'll listen to Master Lucy for sure."

He then scooted over to sit opposite Lucy, eyes sparkling. "Master Lucy, how did you predict that bottle would hit me?"

It was downright eerie. He'd made a last-minute decision to visit the restroom when Felix Von happened to be walking by with a bottle. No one could've planned that coincidence.

After experiencing it firsthand and hearing David Wilson's accounts, Hunter was now utterly in awe of Lucy.

Lucy took a sip of tea. "Your face shows signs of a peach-blossom hex. A simple divination revealed tonight's blood calamity."

"Peach-blossom hex?" Hunter's eyes widened.

"Yes," Lucy nodded. "The person who hit you—does he fancy someone who's pursuing you?"

"Incredible!" Hunter slapped his thigh. "You can even tell that?"

He had an obsessive admirer who'd followed him from abroad. Only today did he learn Felix had a crush on the same girl—no wonder he'd been causing trouble.

He'd told no one about this, yet Lucy saw right through it.

Ethan frowned. "Watch your language."

Hunter: "..." Since when did this guy care about his swearing?

Truly, even heroes falter before beauty.

"Right, right," Hunter mimed zipping his lips. "I'll behave."

Lucy suddenly asked, "You said the attacker was Felix Von?"

"Yeah," Hunter sneered. "Thinks he's hot stuff because his family's loaded."

Their circle preferred keeping low profiles. Hunter had recently relocated his overseas business back home. Felix had no clue about his real background—otherwise he'd never have dared lay a hand on him.

But this grudge was bookmarked. Payback would come.

Lucy's gaze turned icy. "The grandson of the Gould Group?"

Hunter gaped. "You can divine that too?"

He explained, "The chairman's grandson through marriage—but," he lowered his voice, "a stepdaughter's baggage."

"That old bastard's no saint either," Hunter said disdainfully. "Married a widow right after his first wife died, even made the stepdaughter take his surname."

"Worst part? Twenty-some years ago, his biological daughter's fiancé got stolen by that stepdaughter. Soon after, his real daughter vanished. The Goulds claimed she eloped."

"Disgusting," Hunter spat. "What a vile family."

Lucy's smile was frosty. "Utterly repulsive."

"Right?" Hunter agreed. "Heard the old man's dying now, suddenly wants to find his real daughter again."

Lucy's nails dug into her palms. "How dare he?"

"Probably wants to pass the business to his bloodline," Hunter shrugged. "Since the stepdaughter isn't family."

"Hah," Lucy's eyes glinted coldly. "He deserves that?"

Hunter suddenly realized: "You have history with the Goulds?"

Lucy met his gaze and slowly nodded.

"Perfect!" Hunter slammed the table. "The enemy of my enemy!"

He reached out to clasp hands, but Ethan's glare froze him mid-motion.

"I mean," Hunter chuckled awkwardly, "we're clearly fated to meet."

David Wilson and Evan York facepalmed in unison. Could this idiot not see Ethan was jealous?

Lucy laughed. "Quite fated indeed."

"Want me to help you get revenge?" Hunter offered eagerly.

Ethan's voice turned arctic. "That won't be necessary."

Lucy's vengeance was hers to claim. As for him...he'd ensure nothing stood in her way.

Hunter suddenly felt a chill down his spine and hastily waved his hands. "Forget I said anything!"
###Chapter 144: This Is Unbelievable!

Hunter Wilde had no idea that Ethan Smith was planning to visit his grandfather—otherwise, he would have bolted right then and there.

He would’ve also cursed Ethan out in his mind—that scheming bastard was definitely up to no good!

At the moment, however, he was too intrigued by Lucy White’s abilities. "Master Lucy, could you read my fortune again?"

He asked urgently, "Is that peach-blossom hex still there?"

He felt utterly wronged. He had zero interest in that woman and had rejected her multiple times. Yet she had stalked him relentlessly, following him abroad and back. And now, Felix Von—that lunatic—couldn’t get to her, so he was coming after Hunter instead.

Before Lucy could respond, Ethan cut in, "Do you know the rules of fortune-telling?"

Hunter blinked in confusion. "What rules?"

He had never believed in this stuff before—how would he know any rules?

Ethan spoke leisurely, "Divination isn’t free. A metaphysician can’t offer readings without compensation—it’s bad luck for them."

Hunter’s eyes widened in realization. "Ah, I see! Of course, Master Lucy should be compensated."

He asked earnestly, "Do you prefer cash or something else, Master Lucy?"

Ethan interjected again, "Don’t you own an antique company? Why not take Lucy there someday and let her pick a few pieces as payment?"

He knew Lucy had been searching for ancient artifacts that could be used as talismans.

Lucy’s eyes lit up. "You own an antique company?"

Ethan leaned in and whispered in her ear, "Not just that—his older brother runs an auction house. There’s a special event next month."

Hunter: "..." Did they think he couldn’t hear them?

That traitor Ethan was practically spilling all his family secrets just to impress a girl!

But seeing how seriously Ethan regarded Lucy—and now that Hunter himself believed in her abilities—he nodded.

"Yes, I do. If you’re interested, you can come by tomorrow and pick out a few pieces."

He added, "Next month’s auction will have some rare items. I’ll send you an invitation."

It was clear Lucy was intrigued.

Might as well give Ethan a chance to win her over sooner.

A faint smile played on Lucy’s lips. "Is it the one at the Hexagon Club in the suburbs?"

The club had opened last year—an ultra-exclusive members-only venue.

Hunter was stunned. "You know about it?"

His brother had invested in the club, so naturally, the auction would be held there.

Lucy nodded. "I was already planning to attend."

She grinned. "Then I’ll take you up on that invitation."

She had been wondering how to get in—now Hunter had handed her the solution.

Ethan really was her lucky charm!

Hunter waved it off. "No problem at all! I’ll have Ethan escort you."

He shot Ethan a look that said, You owe me one.

Ethan sipped his water, hiding a smirk.

Fine. He’d postpone his visit to the Wilde family for now.

Lucy agreed, "Sounds good."

"Now, let’s take a look at your fortune."

She studied Hunter’s face intently, then asked him to extend his hand.

"Your family is influential—you have three older brothers. At ten, you survived an accident—likely a kidnapping."

"At sixteen, you narrowly escaped death again—a car crash."

"Because of these two incidents, your family dotes on you."

"After that, life was smooth sailing—until today, when a toxic romance turned into a peach-blossom hex, bringing blood calamity."

Hunter was speechless. David Wilson and Evan York were equally stunned.

This was unbelievable!

They had met by chance—Lucy couldn’t have researched Hunter beforehand. And Ethan would never share such personal details.

Those two near-death experiences had made the Wilde family treat Hunter like fragile glass, just wanting him safe and happy.

And Lucy had nailed every detail.

Hunter urged eagerly, "Please continue, Master Lucy."

Lucy grew serious. "The peach-blossom hex isn’t severe yet, but one misstep could turn it into a romantic doom—life-threatening."

Hunter frowned. "Wait, does Felix actually want to kill me?"

He didn’t understand what "romantic doom" meant, but it sounded ominous.

Lucy shook her head. "He’s locked up now—he won’t be a threat anytime soon."

She gave Hunter a meaningful look. "Your real danger comes from that toxic romance."

"The woman chasing you—isn’t she obsessive?"

"Hasn’t she sabotaged other girls who liked you? Extreme methods?"

Hunter slapped his thigh. "Damn, you’re good! How did you know?"

"Exactly! That woman is insane—no matter how many times I reject her, she won’t stop."

"In high school, she harassed any girl who showed interest in me."

"I went abroad to escape her, but she followed me!"

"Recently, she demanded I marry her, so I fled back home. And guess what? She’s here too!"

He groaned, "Master Lucy, do I just attract crazy people?"

Lucy chuckled. "Your aura’s fine—but yes, this all stems from that toxic romance."

Suddenly, she asked, "When you were kidnapped, did you save a girl?"

Hunter thought back. "Now that you mention it… yeah."

"There were three of us—two boys and a girl."

"When the kidnappers realized rescuers were coming, they took the girl hostage, threatening to kill her."

"I grabbed a chair, knocked one out, and dragged her to safety."

"After we were rescued, I never saw her again."
###Chapter 145: Lucy White's Methods

Hunter Wilde's eyes widened in shock.

"Wait!" His voice cracked. "That crazy woman is the same little girl from back then?"

Lucy White sighed softly, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup.

"Correct." She met Hunter's gaze. "The karmic thread between you two runs deep. That's how I was able to trace it."

She paused before dropping another bombshell. "And that car accident when you were sixteen."

Hunter's face paled.

"The one that nearly killed you," Lucy continued quietly, "was orchestrated by one of her toxic admirers."

"The man was jealous of your special place in her heart. When he couldn't uncover your background, he hired someone to stage a drunk-driving accident."

Hunter's knuckles turned white as his fists clenched.

Lucy went on, "Your family later identified the culprit, but he took his secret to the grave—never revealing her involvement. You've been kept in the dark all this time."

A vein pulsed at Hunter's temple.

"Goddammit..." he growled through gritted teeth. "I should've let her drown back then!"

That accident had left him bedridden for over half a year—the memory still sent chills down his spine.

"Master Lucy," he pressed urgently, "how do I break this peach-blossom hex?"

Lucy pondered for a moment. "Do you have a photo of her?"

Hunter immediately pulled out his phone and scrolled through the woman's social media.

"All heavily edited," he scoffed in disdain.

Lucy took the phone, her fingers gliding across the screen.

Suddenly, her brow furrowed.

"She has blood on her hands," Lucy's voice turned icy. "And she's bullied numerous people."

Hunter inhaled sharply.

"I suggest you investigate," Lucy handed the phone back. "Send her to prison where she belongs."

Hunter's eyes flashed with determination. "My thoughts exactly!"

Then a realization struck him, darkening his expression further. "Those two girls who used to pursue me..."

Lucy gave a slight nod.

Hunter slammed his fist onto the coffee table.

"However..." Lucy shifted gears, "even if she's imprisoned, your romantic doom remains."

She produced three divination coins. "Blow on them three times."

Hunter complied immediately.

As the coins landed, Lucy's frown deepened.

"This is complicated." She retrieved cinnabar and yellow parchment. "First, I'll prepare a protective charm for you."

Her brush moved with fluid precision, leaving Hunter and his companions awestruck.

The moment the talisman was completed, a golden glimmer seemed to flash across its surface.

"Keep this on you at all times," Lucy instructed, handing him the folded charm. "Do not let it leave your person these next few days."

Hunter solemnly tucked it into his inner pocket.

That evening, Lucy received a call from Hugo Shaw.

"Master Lucy!" Hugo's excited voice crackled through the phone. "We found them!"

Lucy's lips curved slightly. "Who?"

"The Powell family's adopted sons!" Hugo spat venomously. "Disgusting bastards!"

Lucy wasn't surprised.

The Powells had been playing a long game.

"Use the evidence to force the divorces," Lucy advised. "If that fails, go public."

Hugo's laugh was cold. "Perfect timing to drag the Powell name through the mud!"

After hanging up, Lucy gazed at the moonlit sky outside her window.

This game of chess had only just begun.
###Chapter 146: Sudden Changes

The families who had arranged marriages with the Liu family were now seething with rage upon learning the truth about their stolen fortunes. How could mere reputation compare to the future of their lineage and the fate of their descendants?

After ending his call with Lucy White, Hugo Shaw immediately began making arrangements for the next steps. Lucy then dialed Ethan Smith to update him on the latest developments.

"The Liu family plays dirty," Ethan said, his voice laced with disgust. "I've already reported it. The Metaphysics Society and the Special Investigation Unit are working together on this."

He paused before continuing, "But we've discovered the Liu family has been keeping several feng shui masters on their payroll. They’ve even bought villas specifically for setting up arrays. These people have some real skill if they can manipulate fortune-shifting arrays."

His tone turned grave. "It’s only a matter of time before the Liu family finds out about your frequent contact with Hugo. Be extra careful."

Lucy gently stroked Inklet’s tiny head, a faint smile on her lips. "Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing."

Though her cultivation was still at the Mortal Realm, her arsenal of techniques made her unafraid of the Liu family’s feng shui masters.

"Hunter Wilde invited us to his company tomorrow to check out some antiques. Interested?" Ethan changed the subject.

"Perfect timing," Lucy said, her eyes lighting up.

"I’ll pick you up at noon. We can grab lunch first, then head over?"

"Deal."

After hanging up, Lucy teased Inklet in her palm. "Once we find those rare treasures, I’ll make sure you get a boost too."

"Chirp!" The little creature nuzzled her hand affectionately, its dark eyes sparkling with joy.

The next afternoon, Ethan arrived on time to take her to lunch. This time, he chose a century-old imperial congee house, hidden deep in a hutong courtyard and reserved only for regular patrons.

As soon as they entered the courtyard, they encountered several distinguished elderly gentlemen.

"Well, if it isn’t the Smith boy!" A silver-haired elder greeted with a chuckle. "Where’s your grandfather?"

A robust-looking man beside him teased, "Can’t you see he’s brought a young lady, Old Zhou? Wouldn’t want the old man cramping his style."

"First time seeing Ethan bring a girl around. Is there good news on the horizon?"

The elders, clearly close to the Smith family, bantered back and forth.

Ethan greeted them with ease and introduced, "This is my friend, Lucy White."

Lucy nodded gracefully. "A pleasure to meet you all, gentlemen."

She immediately recognized their high status, yet remained completely unfazed. Her poise earned quiet approval from the elders.

Just as they were about to take their leave, Elder Chu suddenly gasped, staring at Lucy’s bag. "Is—is that an ink monkey?"

Inklet had poked its tiny head out, its curious black eyes peering around.

"Miss Lucy, would you mind letting us take a closer look?" Elder Chu’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

Lucy smiled and called softly, "Inklet, come say hello."

The little creature nimbly hopped onto the table but dodged Elder Chu’s outstretched hand, drawing laughter from the group.

"Such intelligence!" Elder Zhou marveled. "Miss Lucy, would you consider selling it?"

"Not for sale," Lucy replied firmly.

Elder Chu chuckled in mediation. "Spiritual creatures choose their masters. No use forcing it."

As the group continued chatting, Lucy’s gaze landed on Elder Huo—and her heart lurched at the sudden shift in his aura.

"Elder Huo," she spoke up abruptly, "are you Hunter Wilde’s grandfather?"
###Chapter 147: Hanging by a Thread

"Grandpa Wilde, is Hunter your biological grandson?"

Lucy White's sudden question caught the elderly man off guard.

He nodded instinctively. "Yes, why do you ask?"

Ethan Smith's sharp instincts picked up on the tension. His voice deepened as he asked, "Did something happen to Hunter?"

Lucy's expression turned grave. "Your physiognomy shows a sudden dimming in the descendant palace, and the kinship line is fluctuating violently. Hunter's life is hanging by a thread."

"What?" Grandpa Wilde's face paled, and the teacup in his hand shattered on the floor.

The hospital room fell into stunned silence.

Several elderly men who had been playing with the ink monkey froze, their eyes darting nervously toward the commotion.

"Young lady, you can't make such claims lightly," Grandpa Wilde said, his voice trembling with suppressed fury.

Ethan quickly intervened. "Grandpa Wilde, Lucy is a recognized prodigy in metaphysics. She wouldn't be mistaken."

Lucy's fingers moved rapidly as she performed a divination. Suddenly, she looked up. "Within two minutes, you'll receive a call about Hunter's accident."

"Preposterous!" A white-haired elder nearby slammed his hand on the table. "I just saw the boy this morning—he was full of life!"

Yet Grandpa Wilde felt an inexplicable dread creeping into his heart.

Just then—

Ring!

The shrill ringtone pierced the silence of the room.

Everyone's expressions darkened.

With shaking hands, Grandpa Wilde pulled out his phone. The name "Howard Wilde" glared ominously from the screen.

"Hello?" His voice was tight.

On the other end, Hunter's father sobbed uncontrollably. "Dad! Hunter suddenly started bleeding from all orifices and collapsed. The doctors say... he might not make it through the night..."

Clang!

The phone hit the floor with a heavy thud.

Grandpa Wilde staggered back two steps before Ethan caught him.

"Old Wilde!"

"Grandpa!"

Amid the shocked cries, Lucy stepped forward and pressed a finger to the old man's forehead. "Steady!"

A cooling energy flowed into him, instantly clearing his chaotic thoughts.

He seized Lucy's wrist with desperate strength. "Master White, please save my grandson!"

The other elders exchanged bewildered glances, stunned by the sudden turn of events.

Lucy's voice was firm. "We need to get to the hospital. I'll explain on the way."

The group hurried out of the room.

Inside the elevator, Grandpa Wilde clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white. "He was perfectly fine when he left this morning. How could this—"

Lucy cut in sharply. "Has Hunter come into contact with anyone unusual recently?"

Ethan's face darkened. "Yesterday, he mentioned meeting a fortune teller in the antique market."

"I knew it." Lucy's eyes turned icy. "He's been cursed."

"What?" Grandpa Wilde's voice was a mix of shock and rage. "Who dares target my family?"

Outside the ICU, the Wilde family was in hysterics.

When they saw Grandpa Wilde enter with a strange young woman, Hunter's mother rushed forward, weeping. "Dad! Hunter, he—"

"Step aside." Lucy walked straight to the hospital bed.

Hunter lay there, his face ashen, dark blood stains around his eyes, nose, and mouth. The heart monitor's line grew weaker by the second.

Lucy pressed two fingers together and traced a sigil over Hunter's forehead.

"Ahhh!"

A piercing scream erupted from Hunter's body.

The heart monitor flatlined.

"Hunter!" His mother lunged toward the bed with a heart-wrenching cry.

Lucy barked, "Don't touch him!"

She bit her fingertip and let a single drop of blood fall precisely onto Hunter's brow.

"Get out—now!"
###Chapter 148: A Reckless Gamble

The Wilde family living room was eerily silent.

Elder Wilde stood at the head of the room, leaning on his cane, his stern gaze sweeping over everyone present. No one dared to speak, though confusion flickered in their eyes.

Lucy White hurried to Hunter Wilde’s bedside, her heart sinking.

"He’s in bad shape," she murmured to Ethan Smith. "The protective charm I gave him last night is gone."

Ethan’s expression darkened. He turned to the Wildes. "Did anyone see a yellow talisman?"

A little girl with a ponytail timidly raised her hand. "I—I saw the housekeeper burning something in the kitchen this morning..."

Lucy’s pupils contracted. "Just as I thought."

Elder Wilde immediately ordered, "Restrain her!" He then turned to Lucy. "Miss White, what should we do now?"

"Meow!" Inklet suddenly poked his head out of Lucy’s bag, baring his teeth at Hunter.

Lucy lifted Hunter’s eyelid and paled. "It’s a hex."

She quickly scribbled a list: "Vermilion cinnabar, rooster blood, willow branches..."

Without hesitation, Hunter’s uncle rushed out to gather the items.

Lucy took out her talisman brush and swiftly drew intricate symbols on yellow paper. Within half an hour, all the materials were ready.

She poured the dark red mixture into a porcelain bowl, lit the talisman, and dropped it in. As she stirred with the willow branch, the liquid thickened.

"Hold him down," Lucy said, unsheathing the Cursed Dagger.

The moment the blade nicked Hunter’s fingertip, a wisp of black energy seeped into his body. Lucy chanted an incantation, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

"It’s out!" With a faint sound, a greenish worm-like creature plopped into the bowl.

The Wildes gasped.

"A love hex," Lucy said, wiping her brow. "And the most vicious kind."

Elder Wilde’s face turned ashen. "That girl from the Powell family?"

"Exactly," Lucy confirmed. "The hex bears her karmic thread."

Ethan smirked coldly. "The Powells have grown bold lately."

In a few words, he exposed the Powells’ scheme to siphon luck from others, making the Wildes’ expressions grow increasingly grim.

"Why did she activate the hex so suddenly today?" Hunter’s father clenched his fists.

Lucy glanced out the window, her gaze sharp. "Because... she’s here."

Before the words fully left her lips, commotion erupted downstairs.
###Chapter 149: The Depths of Her Deceit

Hunter Wilde's father clutched his phone, his hands trembling slightly.

Just half an hour ago, he had been on the call with his son. Hunter had been complaining irritably, "That Powell heiress is making trouble again, insisting on marrying into our family."

Who could have imagined such a turn of events?

Lucy White exchanged a glance with Ethan Smith.

"Hunter uncovered something yesterday," Ethan said in a low voice. "Miss Powell bribed someone close to him."

"She found out he planned to send her to prison," Lucy continued. "So she struck first."

The elder Wilde's cane struck the floor with a resounding thud.

"The Powells!"

No one could have guessed that the car accident over a decade ago had also been orchestrated by the Powell heiress.

"Miss White," the elder Wilde's voice quivered, "Hunter, he..."

"I'll prepare some Qi Tonic." Lucy retrieved a porcelain vial from her bag. "Consider it a favor to Ethan."

The Wilde family collectively exhaled in relief. They had just witnessed Lucy's capabilities firsthand.

"Thank you," the elder Wilde said solemnly. "The Wildes won't forget this."

Lucy nodded and turned to press lightly on several acupoints along Hunter's body.

"He's waking up."

No sooner had she spoken than Hunter's lashes fluttered on the hospital bed.

The entire room held its breath.

"What... happened?" Hunter's voice was hoarse.

Ethan quickly summarized the situation.

Hunter's expression darkened. "No wonder I dreamed of that madwoman!"

The hysterical accusations in his dream now seemed utterly repulsive.

"Just the work of a brood parasite," Lucy said calmly.

Hunter grabbed her hand. "Master White, give me another talisman!"

Lucy chuckled but handed him a protective charm.

"Keep it safe this time."

Hunter clutched it like a treasure, immediately feeling lighter.

"Come to my company in a few days to pick a thank-you gift," he said earnestly.

Lucy smiled in agreement.

As they left the hospital room, Ethan's phone suddenly rang.

"The production crew just notified us," he said, glancing at his screen. "Filming starts in three days."

Lucy arched a brow. It seemed the Powells' days of peace were numbered.
###Chapter 150: Who's the True Prince Charming?

Lucy White hung up the phone and turned to Ethan Smith in the driver's seat.

"What do you think Director Maurice is scheming this time?" She blinked playfully.

Ethan's slender fingers tapped the steering wheel. "Knowing him, it'd be strange if he wasn't planning something dramatic."

"Though he probably won't dare go abroad again," he chuckled. "Last time's lesson should last him a lifetime."

Lucy burst into laughter. "True enough."

"Let me know if Hunter contacts you."

As she reached for the door handle, Ethan had already circled to the passenger side, opening her door with gentlemanly grace.

Lucy's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Such impeccable service, Mr. Smith."

Ethan's lips quirked upward. "The pleasure is mine."

"See you!" Lucy waved.

"See you." Ethan watched her walk away.

This scene unfolded before Michael Johnson's eyes. His grip tightened on the steering wheel.

"Aunt Grace, that Ethan is always hovering around Lucy. He's definitely up to no good," he grumbled.

Grace White watched her daughter's retreating figure with a gentle smile. "Lucy knows how to handle herself."

She actually thought Ethan seemed quite decent. That considerate gesture just now clearly came from genuine care.

Rachel Johnson sighed inwardly. Her son's emotional intelligence was truly hopeless.

"At least he knows to open car doors for ladies," she pointed out bluntly. "You've never been that thoughtful before."

Michael: "..." Was this really his mother?

"He's just putting on an act!" he protested with a pout.

Rachel smacked the back of his head. "Even his act beats your reality. Lucy's single now—it's good she has quality suitors."

Michael: "..." The pain was real.

"How is he better than me?" he muttered. "Just slightly more famous and better at pretending..."

Rachel glared. "Don't be bitter about what you can't match."

"Go home now," she dismissed him with a wave. "Your aunt Grace and I are going upstairs."

Michael panicked. "I'm coming too! I need to talk to Lucy."

"Don't you dare upset her," Rachel warned.

"As if I would..." Michael whined.

These days he'd enshrine Lucy if he could—upsetting her was the last thing on his mind.

Watching Ethan's retreating figure, he suddenly realized how tactless he'd been before.

When parking, he deliberately walked around to open the rear doors for both elders, mimicking Ethan's earlier gesture.

Grace shook her head with a smile. Too little, too late.

Lucy had just changed into pajamas when the doorbell rang.

"Mom, Aunt Rachel, did you have fun?" she greeted them.

Grace's expression softened. "We did. You should join us next time."

Noah White bounded over. "You have to come, sis!"

"Once I'm less busy," Lucy ruffled her brother's hair before turning to Rachel. "You'll join us too, Aunt Rachel?"

Rachel beamed. "Absolutely! Family should spend more time together."

Michael hastily interjected. "I'm coming too! I'll drive and carry bags!"

Lucy gave him a skeptical glance. "Yeah right, Mr. Celebrity."

Michael looked wounded. "I've changed!"

"Your credibility's long gone with me," Lucy said mercilessly.

She addressed the others. "Hungry? I'll make some noodles."

Michael shamelessly followed her into the kitchen. "I'm starving too..."

Lucy sighed. "Fine, I'll make extra."

Michael's eyes lit up as he leaned in. "Knew you'd say yes!"

"Back up. You're in my way," Lucy pushed him aside.

Michael obediently retreated two steps. "I'll just stand here and chat."

After a pause, he ventured: "Lucy, Director Maurice contacted my agent today about auditioning for a Republican-era drama's male lead..."

(Subsequent plot remains unchanged)
###Chapter 151: What's His Game?

Michael Johnson was currently the hottest name in Hollywood.

With two blockbuster films and a hit reality show under his belt, his star power had skyrocketed, and scripts were flooding in.

Yet he turned them all down.

Only one thought consumed him—winning Lucy White back.

His phone pinged with a new message from his agent.

"Director Maurice Ford's new film has a compelling supporting male role. Interested?"

Michael skimmed the script, his expression darkening with each page.

"What kind of garbage role is this? Pining for the female lead till death? No way."

He dialed Director Ford immediately, ready to deliver a scathing rejection.

"Director, do you really think I'd play some—"

Before he could finish, the director cut in, "Lucy's been cast as the female lead."

Michael swallowed his sarcastic remark.

"Can I audition for the male lead?" he asked urgently.

"Lead's already cast. Confidential." The director's tone brooked no argument.

Hanging up, Michael immediately called Lucy.

"Heard you landed Director Ford's new project?" His voice betrayed his eagerness.

Lucy, mid-face-mask, raised an eyebrow. "Yeah, won it fair and square."

"Do you think... I'd fit the supporting male role?" he ventured cautiously.

Lucy burst out laughing. "Perfect fit. Basically playing yourself."

"How so?" Michael bristled.

"Bad temper, stubborn, and ridiculously prideful," she counted off on her fingers.

"I've changed," he muttered petulantly.

"So, are you taking it or not?" Lucy wasn't in the mood for his dramatics.

Michael leaned closer to the phone. "I'd rather play the male lead."

"Dream on," Lucy peeled off her mask. "Ethan Smith's got that locked."

"What?!" Michael's voice shot up an octave.

His fists clenched. Ethan had the audacity to make this move?

"He recommended me for the audition," Lucy added.

Michael forced a smile. "With your talent, you'll nail it."

"Did hell freeze over?" Lucy sounded genuinely surprised. "You're complimenting me?"

Jealousy gnawed at him. "Did... he recommend me for the supporting role too?"

"Yep." Lucy's tone was matter-of-fact.

Michael narrowed his eyes.

What was Ethan playing at? Hand-delivering him a chance to get close to Lucy?

This had to be a trap.

"I'll do it!" he ground out through clenched teeth.

Even if it was a pit, he'd jump in. No way was he letting Ethan have solo access to Lucy.

Hanging up, Michael punched the couch.

"Ethan Smith, just you wait!"

Meanwhile, at Lucy's home...

Noah White dutifully cleared the dinner table while Grace White took her daughter's hand.

"I'm thinking of opening a farmstay," she said softly.

Lucy instantly understood her mother's intention, her eyes growing moist.

"I'll help set up the wards," she said, leaning into her mother's embrace.

Grace gently stroked her daughter's hair, her gaze resolute.

This time, she would protect her children at all costs.

###Chapter 152: She Never Leaves Loose Ends

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Lucy White stretched lazily.

"Mom, let's go scout locations for the greenhouse today," she said, adjusting her mother's collar.

Grace White's eyes lit up. "Perfect timing. I've been researching some new plant varieties."

The mother-daughter pair drove to the suburbs and quickly found an ideal open plot.

"Plenty of sunlight here, and close to a water source." Lucy crouched to examine the soil between her fingers. "Good quality too."

She mentally calculated her plans—after building the greenhouse, she'd lease a mountain for a farmstay. Then she'd set up an energy-gathering array and move the whole family there.

"Lucy, what about this spot?" Grace pointed to the southeast corner.

Lucy took out her compass and smiled. "Excellent choice, Mom. The energy flow is optimal here."

After finalizing the location, she immediately called Bruce Wu.

"Mr. Wu, I need a favor."

A hearty laugh came through the phone. "No need for formalities, Master Lucy. Just say the word."

Ever since Lucy resolved the Wu family's crisis, Bruce had been eager to repay her.

"I need a professional team to build a greenhouse." She briefly explained her requirements.

"Consider it done!" Bruce thumped his chest audibly. "I'll make sure it's built to perfection!"

Before hanging up, Lucy casually asked, "How are the Parkers these days?"

Bruce chuckled darkly. "Oh, they're quite the spectacle now. Word got out about them stealing their in-laws' fortunes using metaphysical tricks. Every prominent family is demanding answers."

Lucy's lips curved slightly. "They brought this upon themselves."

"By the way, Mr. Wu," she changed subjects smoothly, "I'd like to lease a mountain for a farmstay. Any connections?"

Bruce caught her meaning immediately. "Leave it to me. I'll have an answer by tomorrow."

As night fell, Lucy worked alone in her study.

Her computer screen displayed drone footage—Liam Parker and Lily Green meeting secretly.

She picked up a brush and meticulously sketched Liam's face, down to the exact mole between his brows.

"Time to close the net," she murmured, tucking the portrait into a pre-made straw doll.

Dipping her fingers in a mixture of Hugo Shaw and Penelope Shaw's blood, she traced intricate sigils onto the doll.

Meanwhile, in a luxury hotel suite...

Lily nestled against Liam's chest. "You've been distracted lately, darling."

Liam forced a smile. "Just tired from work."

As he leaned in for a kiss, a splitting headache struck.

"Ah!" He shoved Lily away, clutching his skull as he writhed on the bed.

Lily turned pale. "Liam! What's wrong?"

"My...head..." His eyes turned bloodshot as he smashed his forehead against the wall.

Miles away, Lucy slowly inserted a silver needle into the doll's temple.

"Break!"

With her quiet command, Liam suddenly spewed blood across Lily's face.

The terrified woman fumbled for her phone as Liam collapsed unconscious. Then she felt something vital draining from her body.

When Liam's eyes fluttered open, they held only cold disgust.

"I have business." He dressed hastily and stormed out.

Rain pelted the windshield as Liam stomped the accelerator. That ominous feeling demanded he return to the Parker estate immediately.

He blew through a red light.

SCREECH—

The black sedan collided head-on with a dump truck.

Lucy stood by her window, watching a meteor streak across the night sky.

"First," she whispered.
###Chapter 153: Karmic Backlash

In Lucy White's apartment.

Snap! The straw doll in her hand suddenly burst into flames, casting flickering light across her impassive face.

"Done." A glint of satisfaction flashed in Lucy's eyes.

The oppressive gloom that had weighed on her for years finally lifted slightly. She had just collected the first installment of revenge for her past life's tragic end.

She quickly dialed Ethan Smith.

"Liam Parker's fortune has been broken. It's time to close the net on the Parker family."

Ethan's deep voice came through the phone: "Understood. I'll arrange it immediately."

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city—

Screech—

Amidst the piercing sound of brakes, Liam's sports car slammed into a dump truck. The airbags deployed, but his legs were trapped in the twisted wreckage.

"Ahhh!" His agonized scream tore through the night.

Parker Family Mansion.

"What? Liam's been in an accident?" The patriarch's hand trembled as he held the phone.

After hanging up, he forced composure. "You go to the hospital. I'll fetch Elder Liu."

Passing through layered courtyards, he reached the ancient tower at the estate's heart. Moonlight bathed the dark-tiled structure in an eerie glow.

He stepped carefully along predetermined paths—the grounds were littered with lethal metaphysical traps.

"To what do we owe this late visit, Patriarch?" Two robed figures emerged from the shadows.

The patriarch bowed. "Liam's had an accident. We need Elder Liu's counsel."

One man frowned. "With his fortune, this shouldn't..."

Before he could finish, a dull thud came from upstairs.

"Trouble!" Their faces paled as they rushed upward.

In the attic, Elder Liu spat blood, his divination board split cleanly in two.

"Omen of doom..." He stared at the fractured symbols, aged eyes widening in dread.

Hospital Operating Wing.

"Amputation is necessary to save his life!" The surgeon's verdict made Mrs. Parker faint on the spot.

Elder Liu stormed into the OR. When he saw the wisp of black energy swirling at Liam's brow, his pupils contracted violently.

"Fortune broken, backlash arrived." His voice turned gravelly. "The Parkers... are doomed."

The patriarch staggered as if struck. "How...?"

"Fool boy!" Elder Liu suddenly roared. "Who did he provoke?"

His tortoiseshell divination revealed something terrifying—the blurred augury carried traces of celestial judgment.

Was Heaven itself sealing their fate?

"Prepare to evacuate!" Elder Liu barked.

But they were too late.

When they hurried back, flashing police lights already encircled the ancestral home.

"Mr. Parker, you're required for questioning." The lead agent displayed his badge.

From her high-rise window, Lucy watched the city's glittering tapestry.

"Endgame," she murmured.

In the distance, invisible to ordinary eyes, a dark miasma dissipated above the Parker estate—vanishing into the night like smoke.
###Chapter 154: Backlash

At 3 a.m., Lucy White's phone buzzed violently.

"The Powell family situation is mostly resolved, but the mastermind got away," Ethan Smith's low voice came through the receiver.

Lucy jolted awake, throwing off the covers. "How?"

"We raided all their strongholds, but the old fox who set up the arrays vanished," Ethan's tone darkened. "Surveillance last placed him at the hospital before he disappeared into thin air."

"All footage turned to static."

Lucy smirked. "Clever bastard." Her fingers tapped the phone's back. "Must've used miasmic interference."

"The Metaphysics Society issued a warrant." Ethan paused. "Can you track him?"

She understood his concern. This mess started because of her—that old man would hold a grudge.

"I'll try."

She grabbed three divination coins from her nightstand, shook them in her palm, and cast them.

"Tch. The fox used fortune to mask his trail." Lucy scowled at the hexagram. "Only confirms he fled south."

At her current cultivation realm, pinpointing him was impossible. But she wasn't worried—with Liam Parker neutralized, her mental state had stabilized.

"Will he come after you?" Ethan's voice tensed.

"Relax." She chuckled. "After destroying the Powell estate's array, he'll suffer backlash. By the time he recovers, I'll have reached the Innate Realm."

Ethan exhaled. "We still need you to dismantle the array. The Society's two masters can't handle it."

"I'm on my way."

"I'll pick you up."

"No ne—"

"Roads are slick with rain." He cut her off. "Already en route."

Thirty minutes later, Powell Estate.

Through the downpour, Lucy followed Ethan into the courtyard. Agent Hanks and two others from Special Ops were consulting with Taoist priests.

"Director Yang!" The elder priest clasped his hands.

Ethan nodded. "Master Qingyuan." He gestured sideways. "This is 'Moon,' our array specialist."

Master Qingyuan hid his surprise. This masked young woman radiated formidable spiritual energy.

"Master Moon." His eyes flicked to the compass in her hand—clearly a top-tier artifact.

Inside the array chamber, Lucy traced the wall and suddenly laughed. "A maze array. Clever."

She drew the Cursed Dagger and stabbed the core.

"Break!"

Thunder cracked as jade shattered.

Master Qingyuan gasped. "Masterful technique!"

Ethan's lips quirked. "She's always impressive." The pride in his voice made the old priest glance between them.

Meanwhile, on a southbound train—

"Gack—!" Elder Liu spewed black blood. He stared in horror as his hair whitened and skin withered in the mirror.

"Who...?" Clutching the sheets, his eyes burned with venom.

In a hospital room, the comatose Liam Parker convulsed violently. Monitors shrieked—his vitals were crashing.

Karma's wheel turned without mercy.
###Chapter 155: The Director Scores Big

"Break!"

With a flash of golden light at Lucy White's fingertips, the long-standing fortune array crumbled to dust.

Master Qingyuan's compass clattered to the ground as his eyes widened in disbelief. "It—it's really broken?"

Agent Hanks sucked in a sharp breath. "Master Moon truly lives up to her reputation!"

Lucy wiped a faint sheen of sweat from her temple, her lips curving slightly. "The array was already weakened by backlash. I just delivered the final blow."

What she didn’t say was that she had spent three months meticulously setting the stage for this moment.

As the last wisp of dark energy dissipated, Lucy suddenly felt lighter.

"What’s this—?" She looked down in surprise as a golden thread of light sank into her chest.

Master Qingyuan clasped his hands excitedly. "Karmic Radiance! The heavens reward those who break such curses!"

Lucy’s eyes sparkled. Who knew revenge could come with such a bonus?

"Master Moon." The old master handed her a gilded business card. "The Metaphysics Society would be honored to have you."

She accepted it politely. "Once I settle some personal matters, I’ll pay a visit."

Internally, she smirked. When she finally revealed her true identity, those old-timers would lose their minds.

"Professor Lucy!"

The moment she stepped into the VIP lounge, her students swarmed her.

Lucy laughed, high-fiving each one. "Miss me after just a few days?"

"Like crazy!" Robert Lee clutched his chest dramatically. "Food tastes bland without you around."

William Jones rolled his eyes. "You posted a hotpot feast on social media yesterday."

As the group burst into laughter, Ethan Smith entered.

Dressed in a navy trench coat that accentuated his broad shoulders and long legs, his stern expression softened visibly the moment his gaze landed on Lucy.

"Professor Ethan’s looking extra sharp today!" a student teased.

Ethan calmly took the seat beside Lucy. "Just decent genes."

Lucy nearly choked on her water.

The door swung open again, revealing Lily Green, her face pale beneath thick layers of makeup that couldn’t hide the dark circles under her eyes.

"Lily—" A student started to greet her but was quickly hushed by their peers.

The atmosphere turned awkward.

Lucy lowered her gaze, suppressing a smile. The morning headlines had announced the downfall of the Powell family—no wonder the so-called "Fortune’s Darling" looked like she hadn’t slept.

"Sorry for the wait!" The director bounded in, beaming. "Guess where we’re headed this time?"

William hugged his backpack warily. "If it’s another survival island, I’m jumping off this ride."

"Relax!" The director lowered his voice conspiratorially. "We’re going to—Heritage Mountain!"

"What?!" Robert leaped up. "The legendary Heritage Mountain with the 72 lost arts?"

Lucy’s eyes lit up instantly. She’d always wanted to visit in her past life but never got the chance.

"Better yet," the director waved his access pass triumphantly, "we’ve got clearance to the inner sanctum!"

The livestream chat exploded:

[Holy—! Did Strawberry TV unlock some secret achievement?!]

[Even government officials need appointments for the inner sanctum!]

[Signing up for VIP just to see Lucy wield a sword!]

The director glanced at the skyrocketing viewer count, grinning ear to ear. When Ethan gave him a subtle nod of approval, he straightened with pride—this favor was paying off big time.

During boarding, the director "coincidentally" assigned Ethan and Lucy adjacent first-class seats.

Ethan took the blanket from the flight attendant and draped it over Lucy’s lap. "Rest. It’s a two-hour flight."

Her ears tinged pink, but she didn’t refuse. "Wake me when we land."

As clouds rolled past the window, she allowed herself a small, secret smile.

This trip just got a lot more interesting.
###Chapter 156: The Actor's Gambit

Inside the airplane cabin, Michael Johnson glared at the two figures seated side by side in front of him, grinding his teeth in frustration.

That damn fox, Ethan Smith! he cursed inwardly.

Every single time, Ethan somehow managed to secure the seat next to Lucy White. Who would believe he wasn’t pulling strings?

In the front row, Lucy turned slightly toward the man beside her. "Mr. Smith, have you been to Heritage Mountain before?"

Ethan’s lips curved faintly. "I’ve visited the Calligraphy Pavilion to meet a master calligrapher." He paused. "It’s a place that would suit you."

Lucy’s eyes brightened. "You seem to know me well?"

"Remove the 'seem,'" Ethan murmured with a low chuckle, his warm breath brushing her ear.

Her ears tinged pink, her pulse quickening. "Why do you know me so well?"

Ethan leaned closer, his voice a deep whisper. "A secret."

The subtle tension made Lucy instinctively pull back, only to catch the sly amusement flickering in his eyes.

"Ethan!"

"Hmm?"

"You’re doing this on purpose!"

He merely smiled, his long fingers lightly tucking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear.

The sight made Michael’s grip tighten on his armrest, nearly crushing it.

Damn fox! he seethed silently.

After landing, the production crew’s vehicles were already waiting.

Ethan swiftly loaded both his and Lucy’s luggage into the same car before turning to flash Michael a victorious smirk.

Michael: "..."

He turned and met Lily Green’s hopeful gaze. Without a word, he shoved past William Jones and scrambled into Robert Lee’s car.

William: "???"

Lily’s face paled, but she forced a smile and approached William. "Guess I’ll have to trouble you, Mr. Jones."

The live comments exploded:

[Poor Lily!]
[Michael is so rude!]
[Serves her right after all her antics.]

William maintained a polite smile before closing his eyes for the entire ride, offering zero conversation.

Three hours later, the convoy arrived at the quaint town nestled at the foot of Heritage Mountain.

Traditional wooden structures lined the slopes, connected by winding cobblestone paths, the air sweet with floral notes.

When the director announced the rules, everyone groaned in unison.

"Making us fend for our own meals again?"

"Director, you’re inhuman!"

The director grinned. "It’s the best way to immerse in traditional culture!"

Robert suddenly raised his hand. "How are teams divided this time? I want to be with Lucy!"

"Same here!" the others chimed in.

Michael immediately planted himself beside Lucy, staking his claim.

Ethan said nothing, merely casting an amused glance at the director.

The director wiped his brow. This cast is impossible.
###Chapter 157: Are You Serious?

Under the expectant gazes of everyone, the director cleared his throat.

"Team formation is mandatory. The official competition starts tomorrow."

"This time, it'll still be two guest stars leading each team."

"Drawing lots is too troublesome. Let's just go with yesterday's carpool groups."

Before he could finish, Michael Johnson slammed the table and stood up. "No way! Grouping like this every time is completely unfair!"

"Director, are you doing this on purpose?"

This guy was definitely up to something—pairing Ethan Smith and Lucy White together repeatedly? No one would believe there wasn't any foul play!

The other guests immediately chimed in: "Exactly! The director's being biased!"

"We demand a reshuffle!"

William Jones protested the loudest. He absolutely didn’t want to be teamed with Lily Green. The previous two teams paired with her had suffered terrible luck, and he wasn’t about to follow in Robert Lee’s footsteps.

Vanessa Knight raised her hand. "How about we draw lots to decide?"

Olivia Davis agreed. "Right! You keep separating us from Lucy. Director, have a heart!"

The trainees grew even more agitated. "Draw lots! It has to be fair!"

"We want equal competition!"

The director: "..."

He’d just wanted to save some trouble. How had he provoked a mutiny? Clearly, he couldn’t brush this off.

"Fine, fine. We’ll draw lots for teams."

"Let’s split into two teams—four guest stars leading ten trainees each."

"Perfect for a head-to-head match."

Hearing this compromise, everyone finally settled down.

"Deal! Let’s draw!"

The crew quickly prepared a lottery box, and the guests stepped forward one by one.

Lucy White drew first. She unfolded her slip and waved it. "Team One!"

Olivia Davis pulled a "One" and happily rushed to hug her. "Finally, I get to be on Lucy’s team!"

When it was Michael Johnson’s turn, his palms were sweating with nerves. Seeing the "One" on his slip, his eyes lit up instantly. "I’m on Team One too!"

Robert Lee and William Jones drew "Two" and groaned. "Terrible luck!"

Lily Green stared at her "Two," silently praying: Please let Ethan be on our team...

Now only Vanessa Knight and Ethan Smith remained.

Ethan gestured politely. "Ladies first."

Vanessa randomly picked one and sighed upon unfolding it. "Ugh, missed out on Lucy."

Ethan leisurely opened the last slip—"One."

Michael Johnson’s face immediately fell. Why does it have to be him again?!

William Jones remarked sourly, "Ethan’s luck is insane."

"Officially jealous!" Robert Lee joined in.

Ethan’s lips curved slightly. "Fate."

This time, he genuinely hadn’t rigged it. Pure coincidence.

Lily Green was crushed. Why had her lucky charm failed her?

The trainees began drawing. Lucas Young and Benjamin Harris got Team One and high-fived excitedly. "Awesome!"

Jason Wright and the others stared at their "Two" slips, on the verge of tears. "We wanted to be with Lucy..."

The director observed the final lineup with a meaningful smile.

"I think Team Two has the upper hand this time."

"Robert excels in music and arts. William’s a master of opera. Clear advantages."

Hearing this, Team Two’s morale soared.

Robert Lee thumped his chest. "We’ll carry you to victory this time!"

"Go, Robert!" the trainees cheered.

Vanessa Knight blinked. "I trained hard for that embroidery film."

Lily Green refused to be outdone. "I’ve studied martial arts."

She emphasized, "My instructor said I had real talent."

Team Two’s spirits lifted. "We’re winning!"

Viewers flooded the live comments:
[Team Two’s making a comeback!]
[Lily knows martial arts? Seriously?]

William Jones smirked. "Watch out—we might crush you."

Ethan smiled faintly. "We’ll see."

Lucy added, "Game on."

Olivia Davis waved her tiny fist. "Never back down!"

Suddenly, Michael Johnson spoke up. "I know martial arts too."

He glanced at Lily Green, dead serious. "If it comes to a one-on-one, I’d win."

The room erupted in laughter.

Lily Green’s face turned ashen. Who wants to fight you?!

The comments exploded:
[LMAO this guy’s a walking steel beam!]
[Lily’s face just turned green!]
[Michael: Martial arts duel? I’m dead serious.]
[Why does Michael seem kinda cute now?]
[New Michael fan, signing up!]
###Chapter 158: Obviously Not an Option

After the teams were assigned, the director gave the signal, and both groups set off.

"Attention! Each guest must lead their trainees independently," the director suddenly added. "Anyone caught freeloading off their teammates will have their earnings confiscated by the production crew!"

The show’s appeal relied on self-earned income—the producers had planned this from the start.

"Director, you’re ruthless!"
"Director, I knew you had ulterior motives!"

Though the guests complained aloud, they all recognized this as a prime opportunity to shine. Aside from Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson, who didn’t care about the spotlight, the others were already strategizing how to stand out—especially Lily Green.

After a quick stop at their rooms to freshen up, everyone headed out.

The ancient town was famous for its traditional crafts, with pottery, paper-cutting, and woodcarving workshops lining the streets. Peking opera melodies drifted from teahouses, while street performers called out for audiences.

Lucy White reluctantly tore her gaze away from a pair of clay figurines and tugged at Olivia Davis’ sleeve. "I really want to buy these!"

Lucy chuckled. "After the livestream, we’ll come back for a shopping spree."

"Deal!" Olivia’s eyes lit up before she asked, "Lucy, how are you planning to earn money?"

"I’ll borrow tools from a pottery shop and make clay figurines to sell," Lucy said confidently.

Working for someone else wouldn’t pay as well as being her own boss—plus, it was a great way to gain fans.

"You know how to do that?" Olivia’s eyes widened in surprise.

Lucy nodded. "I’ve learned before."

Spotting a pottery shop ahead, Lucy quickly negotiated a rental agreement with the owner.

Lucas Young and Benjamin Harris immediately volunteered. "We’ll help!"

Though they’d never seen Lucy’s skills firsthand, they had blind faith in her.

The livestream exploded with reactions:

[Lucy can make clay figurines?]
[Mine always turn out hideous—can she really pull this off?]
[She’s just doing it for attention. Waiting for her to embarrass herself!]

Fans swiftly countered:
[What do you know? Lucy can do anything!]
[Sit back and watch the haters eat their words!]

Once Lucy was set, she turned to Olivia. "What about you?"

"I’ll have to find a job," Olivia sighed before leaving with her two trainees.

Lucy then glanced at Ethan and Michael. "What’s your plan?"

Ethan pointed to a nearby woodcarving shop. "I’ll rely on my skills too."

He quickly secured a rental, and his two trainees stayed to assist.

[Ethan knows woodcarving?]
[I’d buy it even if it’s ugly!]
[He’s sticking close to Lucy—totally intentional!]
[This ship is sailing!]

Noticing this, Michael sidled up to Lucy. "Lucy, what should I do?" He looked like an eager puppy waiting for instructions.

Lucy knew him too well. "You know martial arts, right? Perfect for street performances at the square."

"Street performances?" Michael gaped. Why did Ethan get to sell crafts while he had to perform like a circus act?

Ethan delivered the finishing blow. "It’s just a performance, not selling yourself. Why the hesitation?"

Michael glared. "Why don’t you do it then?"

Ethan smiled serenely. "Like Lucy, I earn my keep with skills." Translation: Your lack of talent isn’t my problem.

Lucy nodded in agreement, shooting Michael a dismissive look. "Go or don’t. Figure it out yourself."

[Hahaha Ethan’s savage!]
[Michael: sulking silently.]
[That childhood friend’s judgmental stare—priceless!]

Michael: "..."

Seeing Lucy’s rising irritation, he quickly surrendered. "Fine, I’ll go!"

He’d wanted to prove his growth to her, but someone had ruined it yet again. That scheming Ethan was absolutely his nemesis!
###Chapter 159: Masterful Craftsmanship!

Michael Johnson rallied his four trainees for an impromptu street performance. "You two, go borrow some swords," he directed. "The rest, help me set up."

Determined to outshine Ethan Smith, Michael had secured two brand-new martial arts uniforms from an acquaintance. "This will blow everyone away," he declared confidently.

Meanwhile, Lucy White arranged her clay sculpting tools outside a shop.

"Ms. White, are we doing live sculpting?" Lucas Young asked excitedly.

Lucy nodded. "Right here. You boys handle crowd control."

"Leave it to us!" Lucas thumped his chest. He and Benjamin Harris immediately began calling out: "Custom clay figurines! Limited availability!"

Tourists quickly gathered at the commotion.

"Oh my God, it's Lucy White!" A teenage girl dragged her younger sister forward, eyes sparkling. "Lucy, you really do clay sculptures?"

"Any design you'd like," Lucy smiled.

"Could you make one of my sister?" the girl asked hopefully.

"Of course." Lucy's fingers danced across the clay with practiced ease.

Live comments exploded:

[Those are professional-grade skills!]
[My grandma sculpted for 50 years and wasn't this good]
[Is this CGI?]

Within ten minutes, a lifelike miniature of the younger girl emerged.

"It's perfect!" the crowd murmured in awe. After adding delicate paint details, Lucy presented it. "For you."

The child cradled her likeness. "Thank you!"

The older girl flushed with excitement. "Could I get one too?"

"Absolutely." Lucy's gentle smile never wavered as she created another masterpiece.

"How much for both?" The girl reached for her wallet.

Lucy waved her off. "The child's is free. Twenty for yours."

"That's practically giving it away!" the girl gasped.

Lucy winked. "Fan discount."

"I love you, Lucy!" the girl squealed, hopping in place.

Lucy formed a heart with her fingers. "Love you back."

The crowd erupted:

"I want one!"
"Do my son next!"
"Form a line!"

Lucas quickly organized the queue while live comments scrolled wildly:

[She should open a studio]
[Twenty bucks? That's charity work!]
[LEMONs are so lucky]
[Can I still catch a flight?]

Soon, #LucyWhiteClayMagic trended nationally, leaving publicity-hungry celebrities green with envy.

The gap between genuine talent and manufactured fame had never been clearer.
###Chapter 160: Savage Indeed

The streets of Heritage Town buzzed with excitement.

A long queue formed before Lucy White's clay figurine stall, while Ethan Smith's woodcarving shop drew an equally enthusiastic crowd.

"Oh my God, this is uncanny!" A female fan gasped, cradling her newly acquired wooden sculpture.

Ethan's slender fingers guided the carving knife with precision. Wood shavings flew as a lifelike miniature figure gradually took shape.

Next door, Lucy focused on molding clay figures. With deft fingers, she brought an adorable doll to life in her palm.

"Miss, could you make me a bunny?" A little girl with pigtail braids asked shyly.

Lucy smiled warmly. "Of course."

Nearby, Michael Johnson watched with envy before abruptly removing his jacket. "I'm getting in on this!"

Donning black martial arts attire, he brandished a longsword. A single elegant opening stance stopped pedestrians in their tracks.

"Wow! So cool!" Fans screamed excitedly.

Years of Rachel Johnson's rigorous training paid off as Michael's sword dance whipped through the air, drawing cheers from the growing audience.

"Maximum twenty per tip," he announced coolly.

Meanwhile, Olivia Davis meticulously painted in a handicraft workshop. Her oil painting background helped her master the technique swiftly, earning the shop owner's repeated praise.

"Lucy's crew is killing it," Robert Lee remarked while watching the livestream.

Vanessa Knight, already secured an embroidery shop gig, chuckled. "Why don't you perform too?"

"I'll sell calligraphy!" Robert slapped his thigh decisively.

William Jones chose to perform opera at a teahouse, while Lily Green stared intently at Michael's direction.

"I'll check on Mr. Johnson." She smoothed her hair, calculation flashing in her eyes.

Vanessa smirked meaningfully. "Good luck."

When Lily pushed through the crowd, Michael had just changed into crimson martial arts robes. The vibrant hue accentuated his striking beauty.

"Mr. Johnson, let's perform together?" she cooed.

Michael's expression darkened instantly, his gaze darting toward Lucy.

"No." His refusal was blunt.

Undeterred, Lily pressed, "My martial arts are decent. I won't slow you—"

"You look like professional dead weight," Michael cut in mercilessly. "Women should stand on their own."

Grabbing nunchucks, he bolted like escaping the plague.

Students exchanged glances before silently following.

Left alone, Lily stood rigid, her face cycling through shades of fury.

The livestream chat exploded:
[Michael's savage!]
[LMAO he ran like the wind]
[Fake Lily at it again]
[Michael: Don't touch me!]
###Chapter 161: Undeniable Talent

Lily Green never expected Michael Johnson to be so heartless.

She had dated many men, but with Michael, she had genuinely fallen in love.

Now, waves of humiliation crashed over her, and tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

[Michael is such an insensitive jerk. How could he say something so cruel?]
[Is this how you treat a woman?]
[Why not? Our Michael isn’t obligated to help her.]
[Exactly. Lily can’t achieve anything on her own—always relying on men.]
[How dare she ask Michael for help after that embarrassing sulfuric acid incident?]
[Michael’s right. Women should stand on their own. Look how independent Lucy and the others are.]
[Am I the only one who thinks her crying is totally fake?]
[You’re not alone.]
[Definitely not...]

Michael’s firm rejection caused Lily’s luck to dwindle further.

With Julian Powell and Liam Parker’s downfall, her fortune suffered a devastating blow.

Without the boost of luck, the audience’s favor toward her plummeted.

Lucy White noticed immediately—Lily’s aura had weakened yet again.

A faint smile curved Lucy’s lips, her eyes glinting with satisfaction.

At this rate, the so-called "female lead" would soon be no threat at all.

As much as Michael usually annoyed her, Lucy had to admit—this time, he’d done well.

Seeing Michael remain unmoved, Lily could only leave in frustration with her trainees in tow.

She ended up finding work at a local martial arts studio to earn money.

Though her luck had faded, she still fared better than most—the studio paid decently.

Unfortunately, her reputation with the audience was beyond repair, and her career took another hit.

After performing for over an hour, Michael earned a few hundred dollars.

Lucy and Ethan Smith, overwhelmed by customers, worked for three hours before wrapping up.

Their efficiency was remarkable—each pocketing several hundred.

When Olivia Davis finished her shift, the group gathered to discuss dinner plans.

"Should we buy groceries and cook, or eat out?" Olivia asked.

Missing Lucy’s cooking, Michael suggested, "How about we cook at home?"

But Ethan shook his head. "We’re only here once. Let’s try the local specialties. Everyone’s exhausted—cooking would be too much."

He didn’t want Lucy to overexert herself.

Realizing his oversight, Michael inwardly cursed himself.

As much as he disliked Ethan, he had to admit—the man was more considerate.

"Then let’s go for local cuisine," he conceded.

Lucy, appreciating Ethan’s thoughtfulness, smiled. "I’d love to try the regional dishes too."

Olivia linked arms with Lucy. "It’s my first time here—let’s enjoy a proper meal!"

They chose a well-reviewed restaurant and had a pleasant dinner together.

Robert Lee’s group also dined out, but their atmosphere was noticeably strained.

Afterward, the production crew announced a night market event in the town square.

They had coincidentally arrived during the town’s monthly lantern festival.

Red lanterns hung brightly, casting a festive glow over the streets.

The riddle-solving area prohibited phone use to prevent cheating.

Olivia and Vanessa Knight eagerly dragged Lucy around.

"That bunny lantern is adorable!" Olivia gazed longingly at the prize.

Vanessa pointed at a phoenix lantern. "This one’s gorgeous too—but you’d need to solve thirty riddles to win it."

Lucy grinned. "You want them? I’ll get them for you."

Their eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Of course." Lucy winked. "Watch me."

Riddles were child’s play for her.

In no time, she secured the bunny lantern for Olivia and the phoenix for Vanessa.

Both women were overjoyed.

Later, during paper-cutting and sugar-blowing activities, Lucy helped them win more prizes.

"Lucy, you’re amazing!" Olivia gushed, admiration shining in her eyes. "Perfect scores on riddles, masterful paper-cutting and sugar-blowing—is there anything you can’t do?"

Vanessa sighed in awe. "Today’s been eye-opening."

Lucy chuckled modestly. "I picked up some traditional crafts as a kid."

"Some? You’re practically a master!" they exclaimed in unison.

"You could thrive on these skills alone, even without acting."

"Seriously, what can’t you do?"

Even Robert and the others went from stunned to numb.

While others participated in the festival, Lucy was here to showcase her brilliance.

Undeniable talent.
###Chapter 162: The Challenge Won't Be Easy

The morning sun bathed the courtyard of the inn as Lucy White and Ethan Smith returned from their jog, carrying steaming breakfast boxes.

"You two are so thoughtful!" Olivia Davis was the first to rush over, her eyes sparkling as she took the food from Lucy.

The director walked in right on schedule, wearing a mysterious smile. "Today, we'll be visiting the various pavilions of Heritage Mountain. Let's see which team can get through the gates first."

Robert Lee perked up immediately. "Finally, our time to shine!"

"Exactly," William Jones chimed in with a grin. "Yesterday, little Lucy took the ladies out for a night stroll and left us hanging."

Vanessa Knight looped her arm through Lucy's. "If Lucy were a guy, I'd totally chase after her!"

The live comments exploded:
[Ahhh my Lucy is too cool!]
[That damn charm—even girls can't resist!]
[From today onward, I'm calling her "hubby"!]

Lucy shook her head helplessly. "Stop messing around."

"Director," she suddenly asked, "what's the reward for winning?"

The director smirked. "Each cleared challenge earns a special gift from Heritage Mountain."

Robert and William high-fived. "That's an amazing prize!"

Ethan, however, gave a knowing smile. "Don't celebrate too soon."

"Mr. Smith," Robert said confidently, "our team came prepared this time!"

The director cut in, "A friendly reminder—if you don’t meet the requirements, you’ll be turned away."

The group erupted in protest.

"What?" Robert's eyes widened. "Are you messing with us?"

The director shrugged innocently. "Heritage Mountain has its own rules."

Lucy mused, "So the key is meeting their standards?"

"Exactly," the director nodded. "But if one team succeeds, the rest can follow."

William groaned. "Director, you’re too sneaky!"

Live comments flooded in:
[Hahaha the director’s evil!]
[I knew it wouldn’t be that simple!]
[Can’t wait to see them get rejected!]

Seeing the guests about to revolt, the director made a quick escape. "Better get moving, everyone!"

The two teams exchanged glances, tension and anticipation thick in the air. This challenge was going to be far tougher than they’d imagined.
###Chapter 163: The Guiding Ink

The production crew's convoy wound its way up the serpentine mountain road.

An hour later, a quaint, elegant courtyard came into view. Above the vermilion gates, the gilded characters "Calligraphy Pavilion" stood bold and powerful, their strokes carrying the weight of a thousand-year cultural legacy.

Lily Green paused mid-step as she exited the vehicle. Glancing at the trailing cameras, she suddenly turned to Robert Lee with a smile. "Mr. Lee, I hear your calligraphy skills are exceptional. We're eager to witness your mastery today."

Robert's lips twitched. His last visit had ended in humiliation, and this woman clearly intended to embarrass him. But with cameras rolling, he had no choice. "I'll do my best," he forced out.

The gate creaked open, revealing a delicate-featured youth.

"Here for the show, I presume?" The boy scanned the group. "You're all aware of our rules?"

Lucy White, standing at the rear, gave a slight nod. She'd done her research—this place valued genuine talent above all else.

The youth led them past the entrance screen wall. At the courtyard's center stood several huanghuali wood desks, where the Four Treasures of the Study gleamed softly in the morning light.

"Today's challenge is the peony," the boy announced, gesturing to the vibrant blooms in the corner. "One calligraphy piece, one painting. Pass, and you may enter."

Robert took a deep breath and approached a desk. His wrist trembled slightly as he lifted the brush, the first ink stroke bleeding across the xuan paper.

"Magnificent!" Applause erupted as he finished.

Lucy moved closer to inspect. The running script indeed showed skill, though the ending strokes betrayed haste. Her gaze flicked to Lily, who was clapping theatrically for the cameras, and barely suppressed an eye roll.

"Let me see."

A hoarse voice cut through the chatter. An elderly man in indigo robes emerged from the corridor, the sunlight catching the "Quincy" emblem on his chest.

Robert stiffened. "Dean Quincy!"

The old man studied the work, then shook his head. "Pity." His finger tapped a spot. "Too heavy-handed here. You've lost the peony's grace."

Silence fell. Lily's raised hands froze mid-clap before awkwardly lowering.

"However..." The dean's tone shifted. "It's an improvement from three years ago."

Robert brightened, but the director interjected, "So can we proceed?"

"The calligraphy passes, but the painting lacks refinement." Dean Quincy stroked his beard, then looked past the crowd. "Since our young friend Ethan is here, why not grace us with a demonstration?"

Every camera swiveled toward Ethan Smith.

Leaning against a pillar, the actor arched a brow. "Testing me, Dean?"

"I heard your calligraphy is displayed in the Palace Museum?" Robert said eagerly. "We'd be honored to see it!"

Lucy noticed Ethan's almost imperceptible frown. Yet he stepped forward, his long fingers brushing the wolf-hair brush.

"Don't expect much."

The moment the tip touched paper, the entire courtyard stilled.
###Chapter 164: Ethan's Master Plan

Robert Lee stood at the entrance of the Calligraphy Pavilion, his palms slightly damp with sweat.

He had dreamed of stepping inside to see those legendary masterpieces. If he could even exchange a few words with the masters within, his life would be complete.

"Mr. Smith, it's all up to you now," he muttered nervously, rubbing his hands together.

Ethan Smith ran his slender fingers along the edge of the rice paper before suddenly turning to Lucy White. "My calligraphy is passable, but my painting skills are hardly presentable."

A glint of mischief flashed in his eyes. "Luckily, we have an undiscovered prodigy right here."

Everyone's gaze shifted to Lucy.

Vice Dean Quincy adjusted his reading glasses. "This young lady?"

"Exactly." Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Ms. White's paintings are ten times better than mine."

The vice dean's interest was piqued. "For Mr. Smith to praise you so highly, I must see this for myself." He added meaningfully, "Last year, Ethan earned his place in our pavilion with Pine and Crane. If you can surpass that..."

Before he could finish, murmurs erupted through the crowd.

Who would have guessed that A-list actor Ethan Smith was also a master of calligraphy and painting?

And even more shocking—he had just publicly admitted Lucy was better!

Lucy, who had been lounging lazily at the back of the group, nearly choked on her own saliva.

How does he even know I can paint?

"Come on, Lucy, show us what you've got!" Robert clapped excitedly. "I can't wait to see this legendary showdown!"

With a resigned sigh, Lucy stepped forward. As she passed Ethan, she lowered her voice. "You planned this, didn’t you?"

Ethan chuckled softly. "Consider it a chance to impress me."

They took their places at adjacent desks.

Ethan dipped his brush into the ink, then leaned in close to her ear. "I'll write Ode to the Plum Blossom. Will you paint the plum to accompany it?"

His warm breath brushed against her ear, making the tip of it flush pink.

"Actually..." An idea struck her. "Why don’t you write the poem, and I'll paint beside it?"

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Great minds think alike."

The live comments exploded:

[AHHHH that whisper just killed me!]
[The way Ethan looks at her—UNREAL.]
[This is blatant flirting!]
[Too sweet! I’m gonna die from diabetes!]

Haters immediately lashed out:

[Lucy can paint? Yeah, right!]
[Did someone put a spell on Ethan?]
[Waiting for her epic fail!]

Ethan’s brush danced across the paper, the verses of Ode to the Plum Blossom materializing in bold strokes.

"Amazing!" Robert gasped.

Vice Dean Quincy nodded approvingly. "Strong and refined—already the mark of a master." He hesitated, glancing at Lucy. "Perhaps the young lady should—"

"No need," Ethan interrupted. "I trust Ms. White."

Lucy took a deep breath and raised her brush.

The moment the tip touched the paper, her entire demeanor transformed.

Her expression serene, her wrist moved with effortless grace. A lone plum branch bloomed beside the poem, its petals delicate yet vivid.

The crowd fell silent.

Vice Dean Quincy’s glasses slid down his nose, forgotten.

The live comments went wild:

[That technique is PROFESSIONAL.]
[Oh my god, she’s creating a 3D effect!]
[The dew on the petals looks like it’s actually glistening!]

With the final stroke, the room erupted in applause.

"Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!" The vice dean’s beard quivered with excitement. "The poem and painting complement each other perfectly—a true masterpiece!"

Ethan gazed at the artwork, warmth softening his eyes. "I knew it."

Lucy arched a brow. "Knew what?"

He leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "That you and I... are meant to be."

The live comments went into meltdown:

[WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?!]
[LIP-READERS, ASSEMBLE!]
[ETHAN SMITH IS TOO SMOOTH! HOW IS ANYONE SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE THIS?!]

The vermilion gates of the Calligraphy Pavilion slowly swung open.

Vice Dean Quincy gestured grandly. "After you, both of you—"
###Chapter 165: Another Hidden Talent

Vice Dean Quincy carefully cradled the painting in his hands, his eyes sparkling with admiration.

"No wonder Mr. Smith holds you in such high regard, Miss White. Your brushwork is truly exceptional."

Ethan Smith stood nearby, a faint smile playing on his lips. "Does this piece meet the museum's standards?"

"Absolutely," Vice Dean Quincy nodded eagerly. "This single artwork grants you access to our private collections."

Robert Lee studied the painting and couldn't help but praise, "The calligraphy flows like wind, and the composition carries profound depth. A rare masterpiece indeed."

"Lucy, I had no idea you possessed such talent," he said sincerely.

Lucy White offered a modest smile. "You flatter me, Robert."

Vice Dean Quincy asked hopefully, "Would you consider leaving this piece for exhibition?"

"I don't mind," Lucy agreed readily. For her, recreating such work posed no difficulty.

Ethan also nodded. "The honor would be ours." Having their collaborative work displayed here was more than he could ask for.

The vice dean treated the painting like a priceless treasure. "We'll provide authentication documents. You may retrieve it anytime."

"Perfect," they responded in unison.

This artwork finally unlocked the museum's tightly guarded doors. Vice Dean Quincy personally guided them through the珍藏馆, showcasing not only modern masterpieces but also long-lost ancient works.

Livestream viewers watched in awe, flooding the chat with excited comments.

After the tour, the vice dean said mysteriously, "Now, let me introduce you to some distinguished elders."

A young attendant announced their arrival and soon returned to escort them in. When Robert recognized the elderly masters present, his hands trembled with excitement. The livestream exploded—these were living national treasures!

Vice Dean Quincy presented the painting. After careful examination, the masters offered unanimous praise.

Lucy then demonstrated her calligraphy while Ethan improvised a painting, earning another round of applause. Robert also displayed his work. Though slightly less impressive, he still received valuable feedback.

An hour later, the visit concluded.

All three departed with precious gifts—original works personally bestowed by the masters. Others could only watch enviously.

The director beamed. "Thanks to Mr. Smith and Miss White, we've achieved this extraordinary livestream."

"Of course, Robert also contributed significantly," he added.

"I declare Team One the winner of this round!"

With ratings hitting new highs, the director couldn't contain his joy. Inviting Lucy had been his wisest decision.

Robert laughed heartily. "Director, spare me the flattery. Entering the museum was entirely thanks to Ethan and Lucy."

"I look forward to learning from both of you," he said earnestly.

Ethan and Lucy exchanged a glance. "Anytime."

Watching Lucy steal the spotlight again, Lily Green clenched her fists in frustration.

After a light lunch, the group proceeded to their second destination—the Music Pavilion.

Standing before the ancient gates, the director announced, "Now it's time to showcase your musical and strategic talents."

"Those skilled in instruments or chess may volunteer."

Olivia Davis linked arms with Lucy. "Lucy, don't tell me you..."

All eyes turned to Lucy, brimming with anticipation.

"I know a little," Lucy admitted. "Though my chess skills are mediocre."

She turned to Ethan. "You must be quite skilled at chess, Ethan?"

Somehow, her intuition told her as much.

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes. "You know me well."

Michael Johnson scoffed. "Just a lucky guess. Nothing to boast about."

Ethan countered smoothly, "Then why do you never guess correctly?"

Michael fell silent, a pang of bitterness striking him. The effortless默契 between Lucy and Ethan filled him with unprecedented unease.

Olivia clapped excitedly. "Lucy, you're amazing!"

Lucy laughed. "Keep praising me and I'll blush."

She addressed the trainees. "Anyone else skilled in music or chess? Let's try together."

The trainees shook their heads. Those who played piano didn't know古琴; those familiar with checkers had never touched围棋.

"Then our team will be represented by Ethan and Lucy again," Olivia told the director.

The director sighed in relief—at least they wouldn't face dead air.

"Team Two?" He turned to Robert and the others.
###Chapter 166: The Most Unexpected Outcome

The competition between the two teams was always the most thrilling part.

Robert Lee scratched his head. "I know how to play Go, but I'm just average. Doubt I'll pass the test."

William Jones chimed in, "Same here. I only know the basics. Guess we'll give it a shot."

Surprisingly, Jason Wright also knew Go, giving their team three players—an advantage over the other team.

Robert asked, "Who can play the zither?"

Just knowing Go wasn’t enough; they needed a musician too.

Lily Green blushed and spoke softly, "I’ve studied the guqin."

She had trained in the guqin since childhood and even majored in it at art school. When she saw this challenge was set in the "Music Pavilion," she secretly rejoiced.

Especially after hearing Lucy White also played, she was eager to prove herself. She refused to believe her decade of practice could lose to Lucy.

Robert smiled. "Then the zither performance is on you, Lily."

Though he wasn’t particularly fond of her, teamwork mattered.

Lily nodded confidently. "I’ll do my best."

She was determined to impress the judges and win over new fans.

The director, delighted by their enthusiasm, stepped forward and knocked on the door.

Soon, a young woman in traditional attire opened it.

"Welcome to the Music Pavilion. You know the rules—please come in."

Inside, the courtyard bloomed with flowers, with a Go board and guqin placed at the center.

The woman smiled. "Would you like to start with Go or the zither?"

The director immediately said, "Go first."

He figured saving the "rivalry" between Lucy and Lily for the zither would make for better entertainment.

The woman nodded. "Very well. I’ll summon the masters to play against you."

She disappeared into a side room, and soon, three Go masters emerged.

The director had Robert’s team go first.

The rules were simple: one match, winner takes all.

After polite bows, Robert, William, and Jason took their seats.

Within two minutes, William lost.

He chuckled wryly. "I used to think I was decent playing with friends. Now I know what real skill looks like."

The director consoled him. "Don’t feel bad, William. These are national-level masters."

William waved it off. "No need to sugarcoat it. Let’s see how Robert and Jason do."

Everyone expected Jason to lose first, but minutes later, Robert conceded.

"Guess I’m just not good enough," Robert admitted, standing up.

William patted his shoulder. "Still lasted longer than me."

"Jason’s holding up well," they remarked, watching him continue.

Ten minutes later, Jason also lost.

The middle-aged master commented, "Not bad for your age, but impatience cost you. With more focus, you could’ve lasted longer."

Jason bowed. "Thank you for the advice."

His grandfather had taught him, but as the master noted, his impulsiveness was his downfall.

With the entire team defeated, the director wasn’t surprised. If it were easy, it wouldn’t be called the Heritage Mountain challenge.

Robert grinned. "Now it’s up to Ethan."

The others agreed. "Ethan, our fate’s in your hands."

Ethan Smith gave a faint smile. "I’ll do my best."

Then he glanced at Lucy. "Care to join me?"

The director brightened. "Right! Lucy plays too. Why not give it a try?"

Though he doubted she’d win, more participants meant more fun.

"Alright, since you insist," Lucy agreed reluctantly.

Ethan and Lucy sat opposite two masters.

Ten minutes later, the unexpected happened—Lucy, whom everyone assumed would lose, was dominating the game.

The room fell silent as everyone gathered to watch.

Another ten minutes passed, and Ethan won first.

His opponent conceded gracefully. "Your skill is remarkable. I yield."

Ethan bowed. "You honor me."

Then he went to observe Lucy’s match, the master following.

Soon, Lucy placed her final stone. "Thank you for the game."

Her opponent—the same master who’d played Jason—smiled. "Your technique is exceptional. I’d love a rematch someday."

Lucy nodded. "Certainly."

William gasped. "Lucy, you call this 'average'?"

Robert laughed. "If this is average, what does that make us?"

No one had expected Lucy to be this skilled. While perhaps slightly below Ethan, she was undoubtedly a master.

The middle-aged master added, "Miss White’s skill ranks among the best here. Calling yourself 'average' is far too modest."

Lucy sighed. "You flatter me."

To her, she wasn’t top-tier, but apparently, she stood out here.

The director beamed. "Lucy, you’ve been hiding your talents!"

"So, Ethan and Lucy pass the Go test?"

The master nodded. "Of course. If you clear the zither challenge, you may enter."

[Shocking! No one saw this coming!]
[Lucy’s insane—I thought only Ethan could win!]
[Even the masters say she’s elite. Why was she so humble?]
[The haters are in for another L.]
[Can’t wait for the zither face-off.]
[Who’s better—Lucy or Lily?]
###Chapter 167: How Dare She?

The atmosphere around the guqin platform grew instantly tense.

Vanessa Knight's red lips curved slightly as her gaze swept over Lily Green. "Ms. Green seems quite confident. Does this mean you've already secured victory?"

Lily's fingers trembled imperceptibly as she forced a gentle smile. "You flatter me, Ms. Knight. I'm merely doing my best."

Her peripheral vision caught Lucy White's composed demeanor, and it felt like a thorn piercing her heart.

"Which of you would like to perform first?" the young attendant holding the guqin asked softly.

Lucy gestured gracefully. "Shall Ms. Green go first?"

Lily gritted her teeth. This woman clearly wanted to watch her fail!

"Very well." She straightened her back and approached the instrument, deliberately plucking the strings to produce a crisp, clear tone as she took her position.

[Wow, that opening was professional!]
[Who knew the actress had such hidden talent?]
[This round's in the bag]

As the melody flowed, Lily glimpsed the audience's captivated expressions and couldn't suppress a smug smile. But when she caught Lucy's knowing look, her fingers faltered for half a beat.

"Screech—"

The jarring dissonance drained the color from Lily's face.

As the music stopped abruptly, two silver-haired elders emerged from the corridor. Dean Winifred frowned slightly. "Technically adequate, but..."

Lily stood abruptly. "Please enlighten me, Dean!"

"It lacks soul." Dean Winifred shook her head. "The guqin reflects the heart. Your performance had only superficial beauty."

Lily's nails dug into her palms. She saw it clearly—the dean's expectant glance toward Lucy!

"Allow me to try." Lucy brushed her sleeves and took her seat.

At the first note, even the falling leaves in the garden seemed to still.

Lily stared fixedly at those nimble fingers dancing across the strings, her ears gradually filling with the sounds of mountain streams and roaring waterfalls. A sudden realization struck—she'd lost completely.

"Magnificent!" Dean Winifred applauded enthusiastically. "Now this is the true 'Flowing Waters'!"

Darkness clouded Lily's vision. How? How could this amateur outperform her years of dedicated practice?

From an angle hidden from cameras, her bloodshot eyes burned into Lucy's retreating figure.
###Chapter 168: Campus Memories of the Academic Power Couple

The grand doors of the Music Pavilion slowly opened, revealing two silver-haired deans who stepped forward to greet their guests.

"Please follow me," Dean Winifred gestured warmly.

Inside the exhibition hall, rare antique musical scores and chess manuals were displayed behind glass cases. The yellowed parchment still bore crisp ink strokes. Lucy White's fingers lightly traced the display case, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

"This is the long-lost fragment of Flowing Waters!" she whispered in awe.

Dean Winifred nodded approvingly. "You have a keen eye, Miss White."

Meanwhile, Ethan Smith was already engaged in an intense chess match with Dean Wallace. The black and white pieces clashed fiercely across the board.

"Your strategy carries the elegance of ancient masters," Dean Wallace remarked, stroking his beard.

Soon, Lucy found herself surrounded by Go masters. She moved pieces with swift precision, her expressions shifting between thoughtful frowns and bright smiles, drawing murmurs of admiration.

"That girl is extraordinary," one master muttered under his breath.

By sunset, the two were finally released. Before parting, Dean Winifred presented Lucy with a priceless antique zither, while Dean Wallace gifted Ethan a jade Go set.

"This is too much—" Lucy stammered.

"Take them," Dean Winifred said kindly. "True kindred spirits are rare."

On the ride back, William Jones teased, "Are you two planning to empty Heritage Mountain of its treasures?"

Ethan chuckled. "We're honored."

[OMG! That zither looks Tang Dynasty!]
[Ethan's full of surprises!]
[Lucy playing the zither is breathtaking!]

Robert Lee counted on his fingers. "The Medicine Pavilion, Martial Arts Pavilion... Don't tell me you're experts in those too?"

"We know a little," Lucy said modestly.

Lily Green suddenly interjected, "What did you study, Lucy? It sounds fascinating."

The air turned awkwardly silent.

Michael Johnson scoffed. "She majored in Classical Studies at Imperial University. Top scorer in the national liberal arts exams."

His chin lifted slightly as he spoke, pride flashing in his eyes.

"Wow!" the group gasped.

[No way! National top scorer?!]
[Imperial University?! My dream school!]
[How does Michael know so much?]

Robert caught the implication. "Michael, you were also—"

"National top scorer in science," Michael said flatly. "A year above her."

Lucy glanced at him and added, "We went to the same high school."

[Childhood sweethearts?!]
[This is the ultimate power couple!]
[We need throwback photos!]

Soon, the internet exploded. Netizens unearthed old photos:

A stern little boy carrying a pink backpack while holding hands with a lollipop-sucking girl in elementary school;
A teenage girl tugging at a boy's sleeve in middle school;
Their striking high school graduation photo, standing out in matching uniforms.

Most captivating was a candid university shot—under cherry blossoms, a frowning Michael wrapped a scarf around a beaming Lucy.

[This is too adorable!]
[Michael's always been tsundere!]
[Lucy's smile could heal the world!]

Lily stared at the trending hashtags, her nails digging into her palms. She never expected Lucy to have this card up her sleeve.

As night deepened, the production crew's van wound down the mountain toward Heritage Town. Gazing at the starry sky through the window, Lucy smiled faintly. Those buried memories now carried a strange warmth.
###Chapter 169: Something's Off

The hashtag "#LucyWhiteAndMichaelJohnsonChildhoodFriends" instantly went viral across the internet.

As soon as Ryan Clark stepped into the inn, he exclaimed, "Ms. White, you and Mr. Johnson are trending!"

Everyone paused, pulling out their phones.

On the screen were photos of Lucy and Michael together from elementary school all the way through college.

"You two were so close as kids," William Jones couldn't help but remark.

Robert Lee pointed at one photo and laughed, "Looks like Mr. Johnson's been carrying Lucy's bags since childhood!"

In the picture, a teenage Michael, though stern-faced, had a tight grip on Lucy's backpack strap.

Michael stared at his phone, his eyes slightly red.

Long-buried memories came flooding back.

"She always tossed her backpack to me," he said hoarsely. "From first grade through high school—twelve whole years."

But now, he'd lost that girl.

Lucy swiped through the photos, her brow furrowed.

These pictures appearing now was suspicious.

From Michael revealing they were schoolmates to these photos surfacing—it had taken barely half an hour.

Too fast.

Almost as if it had been planned.

Ethan Smith gripped his phone, knuckles turning white.

This was no fan's doing.

Lily Green dug her nails into her palm, burning with jealousy.

How could Lucy have so many precious memories with Michael?

She instantly regretted her earlier comment.

"How sweet," she said with feigned innocence, glancing at Ethan.

Lucy smiled lightly. "Our families have been close for generations. Mrs. Johnson even wanted to adopt me as her goddaughter."

She emphasized the word goddaughter.

Michael stiffened.

She was drawing a line between them.

Lily's eyes lit up. "So Mr. Johnson would be like your brother?"

"Shut up," Michael snapped coldly. "You don't get to call her Mrs. Johnson."

That name belonged only to Lucy.

The atmosphere froze.

"Let's all get some rest—it's been a long day," Robert quickly intervened.

The director wiped his sweat. "Tomorrow's an off day. You're all free to do as you please."

Vanessa Knight tugged Lucy upstairs. "I'm exhausted. Let's go to bed."

The moment the livestream ended, Vanessa lowered her voice. "What's going on online?"

"No idea," Lucy said. "I'll look into it."

The first-floor reading nook was empty.

Michael pushed the door open.

"Wasn't me," he said bluntly.

Lucy nodded. "I know."

She'd never seen those photos before.

"Did you keep them?" she asked, meeting his gaze.
###Chapter 170: The Truth Revealed

Michael Johnson had anticipated Lucy White's question.

He confessed honestly, "I have full backups on my computer. The phone only has that one photo of you acting cute with me." He unlocked his phone and handed it to her.

Lucy scrolled through the gallery—aside from the viral photos online, there were numerous candid shots of her alone, as well as childhood pictures of them together.

Something didn’t add up. "Did your father have these taken?" she asked, then shook her head. "No, he hadn’t found you yet when we were in elementary school."

Michael explained, "The elementary school photos were taken by a private investigator hired by that woman. My father traced us through her."

"The ones from middle school onward were taken by his people," he added, his voice lowering. "Back then, he wanted to make amends but couldn’t see my mother, so he relied on photos to cope."

Lucy finally understood. "That’s why the collection is so complete."

Then she narrowed her eyes. "So how did they end up online? Don’t tell me your father—"

"Not him," Michael cut in quickly. "I already asked."

Lucy raised an eyebrow. "Then your computer was hacked?"

Michael’s ears turned red. He hesitated before admitting, "Actually... I posted them myself."

Seeing Lucy’s skeptical look, he forced himself to continue, "In college, I made a private account and uploaded the photos I liked..."

Lucy nearly laughed in disbelief. "You have that kind of hobby?"

Mortified, Michael muttered, "I missed you too much back then..." The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them.

Lucy rubbed her temples. "What now?"

"I’ll find out who leaked them," Michael promised urgently. "I won’t let the photos spread further."

Lucy said coolly, "Just delete them all."

"No!" Michael shot to his feet, his eyes reddening. "They’re the only things left of—"

"Let the past stay in the past," Lucy interrupted.

Michael clenched his fists, his voice breaking. "How can you be so heartless?"

Ding—

Lucy’s phone chimed. She glanced at the notification and stood. "Do whatever you want."

Michael grabbed her wrist. "Is it Ethan?" He caught a glimpse of "Movie Emperor Ethan" on her screen.

Lucy pulled free. "None of your business."

Watching her walk away without looking back, Michael slammed his fist onto the table.

Outside the inn, Ethan Smith stood beneath a ginkgo tree. Moonlight cast a silver halo around him, accentuating his ethereal presence.

"You needed me?" Lucy approached.

Ethan looked remorseful. "About the photos—it’s my fault."

Lucy stared at him in surprise.

"A family friend’s daughter had you investigated," Ethan said grimly. "When she discovered your history with Michael, she tried to drive a wedge between us."

His brow furrowed. "I’ve already handled it."

Lucy checked her phone—the trending topic had indeed been removed. She smirked. "Fast work."

Ethan exhaled in relief. "You’re not angry?"

"Not at you." Lucy waved it off. "I’ll leave it to you."

When he seemed about to say more, she cut in, "See you tomorrow!" and strode away before he could respond.

Ethan watched her retreating figure and sighed in frustration. Once again, his carefully planned confession had been aborted.
###Chapter 171: Unexpected Encounter at the Jade Auction

Lucy White sank into the plush mattress of her hotel bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. Her fingertips absently traced the smooth surface of her phone screen.

Ethan Smith's confession in the hallway—"I've fallen for you"—had stolen her breath. She wasn't immune to his charm. But the scars from her last relationship still lingered, and with her career on the rise, romance felt like an untimely complication.

Her phone vibrated.

[Ethan Smith: Made it back to your room?]

A smile tugged at her lips.

[Lucy White: Just got in. Heading to bed. You should rest too.]

[Ethan Smith: Goodnight.]

The simple exchange eased the tension in her shoulders. Ethan always knew when to advance and when to retreat, never pressuring her. Perhaps someday... She shook her head and set the phone aside.

Across the hall, Ethan stood by the window, a cigarette glowing between his fingers. He exhaled a wry laugh. That had been too close—he'd nearly lost control. But there was no hurry. He could wait.

At dawn, Lucy set out for her morning run and found Ethan already waiting by the inn's entrance. They exchanged quiet greetings, both carefully avoiding last night's unspoken tension.

"Morning."
"Morning."

The sunlight seemed warmer as they returned to find Michael Johnson glowering in the lobby.

"Lucy, I brought you breakfast," he said stiffly.

She arched a brow. "Thanks, but we got enough for everyone."

Michael's jaw tightened.

The director's timely arrival broke the awkward silence. "Day off today! I'm taking you somewhere special."

Robert Lee eyed him suspiciously. "This isn't another one of your traps, is it?"

"Scout's honor!" The director lowered his voice conspiratorially. "There's a jade auction nearby. Want to test your luck?"

Lily Green's eyes lit up. Gambling on raw jade? This was her forte. Her fingers brushed the jade bracelet on her wrist—her secret advantage.

Lucy considered the opportunity. She needed quality jade for crafting talismans.

"Let's take a look," she murmured.

Ethan and Michael answered simultaneously: "Agreed."

The director beamed. "It's settled then!"

The livestream exploded with comments:
[An auction?! Director's outdone himself!]
[Bet Lucy's gonna work her magic again!]
[Lily always gets lucky—she'll score big for sure!]

An hour later, the group arrived at the auction house. A staff member greeted them enthusiastically: "This section displays cut stones, while that area has raw jade lots..."

William Jones cracked his knuckles. "I'm getting my wife a premium piece!"

Lily plotted silently. She'd outshine them all with multiple high-value finds.

Then Lucy froze.

Her gaze locked onto a well-dressed group entering the venue. The leading man spotted her and stiffened.

"Lucy?"

All warmth drained from her expression.

"What a coincidence... ex-boyfriend."
###Chapter 172: A Fateful Encounter

A group emerged from the opposite entrance.

Leading them was a distinguished middle-aged man with striking features and impeccable grooming. By his side walked a young man—tall and handsome—and a dazzling young woman.

The entourage also included a man in his fifties, along with several assistants and bodyguards.

Lucy White's pupils contracted.

Frederick Von.

The scum who had betrayed her mother.

And those siblings—Felix and Fiona Von.

The Von family specialized in jewelry, a perfect match for the Gould family's jade business. Her mother's engagement to Frederick should have been a powerful alliance.

But this man had secretly carried on with Giselle Gould, her stepmother.

When her mother discovered the affair, she immediately called off the engagement and exposed their disgrace. Yet her grandfather, swayed by Giselle's manipulations, blamed her mother for being unreasonable.

Later, her mother suffered an "accident." Heartbroken, she left the Gould family, changed her surname, and moved far away.

There, she met Lucy's father.

In her past life, Lucy had been relentlessly attacked in the entertainment industry—not just by Lily Green and her entourage, but also by Giselle and her daughter.

Fiona Von was a ruthless character in the original story.

She stole her best friend’s fiancé, swallowed the Gould empire, and became CEO—a textbook "successful woman."

Her most notorious talent? Jade gambling. She once swept a third of an auction’s top-grade jade, setting an unprecedented record.

And her rise began at this very auction.

Lucy still remembered how, in her past life, Giselle had hired international assassins the moment she discovered Lucy’s mother was alive.

Fiona, meanwhile, openly and covertly aided Lily in crushing Lucy.

At first, Lucy couldn’t understand why they would hunt her mother down when the Goulds were already in Giselle’s hands.

Then Hunter Wilde’s words had struck her like lightning.

Her grandfather had once declared he would pass the family legacy to his trueborn daughter.

That single sentence had marked her mother for death.

The irony? Her mother had never wanted the Gould empire.

To Lucy, inheriting such a tainted family would only dirty her mother’s hands.

"Quite a few major companies are here today," William Jones remarked, pulling Lucy back to the present.

The guide smiled. "This is the largest domestic jade auction. All the top jewelers attend. That’s Mr. Von of Von Jewelry over there."

Robert Lee marveled, "He looks so young—barely thirty."

"Mr. and Mrs. Von are known as the industry’s model couple," the guide added.

Lucy’s lips curled into a cold smirk.

Model couple?

In her past life, Frederick had hounded her mother, begging for forgiveness and vowing to make amends.

Pathetic.

Back then, he’d complained her mother wasn’t gentle enough. Now he found Giselle vulgar.

A man like that deserved to be played by both women.

Vanessa Knight snorted. "Nine out of ten ‘perfect couples’ in this industry are faking it."

Olivia Davis quickly elbowed her—they were still live.

Vanessa rolled her eyes but dropped the subject.

As the cameras panned to the trading floor, Lucy murmured, "You know them?"

"That bitch Fiona stole my best friend’s fiancé," Vanessa hissed through gritted teeth. "Like mother, like daughter."

Lucy smirked. "The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree."

Her stepmother seduced a married man; now her daughter stole a friend’s man. A true family tradition.

"Guess we’re sisters in hating the same people," Vanessa said cheerfully, linking arms with Lucy.

When the cameras returned, they seamlessly switched topics.

The guide led the group through the trading area.

William asked, "Can we get expert advice? We know nothing about raw jade."

"Sorry, that’s not possible," the guide admitted. "Even veterans with decades of experience can’t guarantee a win."

"In this business, luck matters more than skill."

"Some strike it rich overnight; others lose everything. Just treat it as fun."

William abandoned the idea of hiring an expert.

The guests dispersed—some examining rough stones, others watching the cutting process.

Olivia and Vanessa stuck close to Lucy.

"Lucy, are you buying raw jade?" Vanessa asked curiously.

Lucy crouched, fingertips brushing a dull gray stone. "Since we’re here, why not try?"

"What about you?"

In that cultivation world, she had studied jade gambling extensively.

Jade was an excellent vessel for spiritual energy, invaluable for formations and cultivation.

Olivia frowned. "I want to, but I don’t know how. Lucy, do you understand this?"

She was startled to see Lucy inspecting the stones like a seasoned expert.
###Chapter 173: This Guy's Brain is Missing a Few Screws

Sunlight streamed through the glass dome of the jade auction, casting golden pools across the exhibition floor. Lucy White bent over a grayish-brown rough stone, her fingers tracing its surface with practiced ease.

"Lucy, you look like a professional jade appraiser!" Olivia Davis exclaimed, her eyes sparkling as she leaned in closer.

Lucy's lips curved slightly. "I picked up a few things from my mentor."

"Teach us how to spot the good ones!" Vanessa Knight grabbed her arm, pouting playfully.

Lucy tapped the stone before them. "Auction roughs come in three types. Full roughs like this are the most thrilling—you can't tell if there's jade inside at all."

"Half-roughs have a 'window' cut to reveal some jade quality, but what lies beneath remains a mystery."

"Then there are open specimens—safest but most expensive. It's all about the gamble."

As she spoke, Lucy jotted down the stone's catalog number with fluid precision.

The live comments exploded:
[Damn, Lucy actually knows this stuff!]
[Her knowledge range is insane!]
[Someone's about to get humiliated again lol]

Vanessa gazed at her pleadingly. "Pick some for me? I'm completely lost!"

"Me too!" Olivia raised her hand eagerly.

Lucy chuckled. "Choose your own first. I'll vet them for you."

"You're the best!" Vanessa lunged to hug her. "If you were a man, I'd marry you right now!"

Olivia shoved her aside. "I called dibs first!"

The livestream audience went wild:
[The battle for Lucy's affection is real]
[That irresistible Lucy charm]
[Back off, she's mine!]

Their laughter was interrupted by a looming shadow.

"This specimen is inferior." A man's greasy voice oozed over them. "Grainy texture with inclusions—won't yield decent jade."

Lucy turned to meet a pair of unsettling eyes.

"I disagree." Her tone turned frosty as she finished noting the number.

Felix Von's throat worked as he stared at her delicate profile. At his signal, a subordinate "accidentally" knocked over a camera rig.

"Miss White." He extended a gilded business card. "Care for tea?"

Lucy ignored it. "Do we know each other?"

"Who in the industry doesn't know the famous Lucy White?" He smoothed his hair with faux nonchalance. "My jade expertise could—"

"Pass." She turned to leave.

Felix dropped his voice to a threatening whisper. "You realize who I am? Cross me, and your career is over."

Lucy's eyes narrowed. "And?"

"I want you." He stepped closer. "Be mine, and I'll give you any resource you desire."

Lucy: "..."

This idiot must be missing half his brain cells.
###Chapter 174: A Walking Punching Bag

Lucy White crossed her arms, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

Just as she was about to taunt Felix Von, the cold voice of Michael Johnson cut in from behind.

"With a face like that, you actually dare to lust after Lucy?"

Michael had casually picked out a few raw stones when he spotted Lucy selecting jade alone in the distance. He had intended to approach her, only to overhear Felix's crude remarks, instantly igniting his fury. If not for the public setting, he would have already thrown a punch.

Felix turned around, his face dark with rage, ready to unleash a torrent of curses—until he recognized Michael. The words died in his throat. The Von family was currently seeking a partnership with the Johnsons, and he couldn’t afford to offend the heir.

"Miss White, you’d better think carefully about my proposal," he muttered under his breath, his tone laced with threat.

Lucy tore his business card into pieces right in front of him.

"Michael’s right," she sneered. "You should take a good look in the mirror. See if you even deserve to breathe the same air as me."

Felix’s expression twisted. "You—!"

How dare a mere actress act so arrogantly?

"Just you wait," he spat venomously before storming off.

Lucy’s fingers twitched imperceptibly, and a wisp of miasmic energy slithered unnoticed into Felix’s body. His face bore the marks of cruelty, his hands stained with blood. From today onward, he wouldn’t be harming any more women.

And she’d make sure his life was plagued by endless "accidents."

"Are you okay?" Michael asked, concern lacing his voice.

Lucy shrugged. "Just a stray dog barking."

"A rabid one, at that," Michael agreed, then lowered his voice. "He’s that woman’s son?"

Lucy nodded. "The whole family’s rotten."

"Should we leave?" Michael suggested.

Lucy arched a brow. "Why should I be the one to avoid them?"

"This auction will leave them empty-handed."

Michael chuckled indulgently. "Fine. I’ll stay with you."

Just then, Ethan Smith approached with a small entourage.

"Did Felix bother you?" he asked bluntly.

Lucy answered plainly. "He offered to be my sugar daddy. I told him off."

Ethan’s gaze turned icy.

Evan York adjusted his glasses. "Felix just got out of jail. Seems he hasn’t learned his lesson."

"Miss White, we meet again," he greeted with a smile.

Lucy inclined her head. "Here for the jade auction, Mr. York?"

"My jewelry company needs raw materials," Evan explained.

Ethan added, "His company and Von Jewelry are bitter rivals."

Evan grinned. "With your blessing, I’ll crush them this time."

"How’s your selection going?" Ethan asked Lucy.

"Only halfway through," she replied.

"Let’s go together," Ethan said. "I’ll help Evan pick a few stones too."

Lucy agreed.

Michael suddenly interjected, "You know jade appraisal, Mr. Smith?"

Ethan smirked. "Got a problem with that, Mr. Johnson?"

"Just worried you’ll embarrass yourself in front of the crowd if you pick duds," Michael challenged.

Ethan remained unruffled. "I could say the same to you."

Tension crackled between them, but Lucy pretended not to notice, turning back to examine the stones.

Meanwhile, Felix returned to his sister, Fiona Von, his face thunderous.

"What happened?" Fiona asked.

After hearing his account, Fiona’s cold gaze locked onto Lucy. For some reason, she had despised this woman at first sight.

"Playing hard to get," she scoffed. "Once she’s in your hands, we’ll see how she begs."

Felix bared his teeth in a vicious grin. "Exactly."
###Chapter 175: Mine

Lucy White had mastered a unique jade appraisal technique that allowed her to sense energy fluctuations within raw stones, not just assess their outer layers.

If a jadeite rough emitted energy, it concealed precious jade; if not, it was worthless. The richer the energy, the higher the quality.

Yet she didn’t get greedy—she only selected one-fifth of the high-energy stones. After all, with so many bidders at the auction, others deserved a chance too.

To avoid drawing attention, she deliberately mixed in a few worthless pieces. A 100% success rate would’ve been far too conspicuous.

When Fiona Von began picking stones, Lucy had an idea. Leaning close to Ethan Smith, she whispered, "Ethan, I want to buy more, but livestreaming the cuts would be too obvious. Can we register them under your friend’s name?"

His lips curved. "Easy."

After a quiet exchange with Evan York, the latter agreed without hesitation. Lucy promptly handed Evan’s assistant the numbers of her chosen stones and her bank card.

Ethan also made selections, but deliberately avoided overlapping with Lucy’s. His motive wasn’t personal—he simply wanted to help his friend while inconveniencing the Von family.

By the time they finished, Evan’s assistant had already completed the transactions.

Soon, they reached the central auction floor, where the roughs were of superior quality—and priced accordingly.

Lucy’s gaze locked onto an unremarkable stone. This time, she decided to act personally. Michael Johnson volunteered to handle the payment, taking the number tag to the counter.

Just then, Fiona’s group arrived.

Lucy noticed Fiona running her fingers over each stone, her fingertips emitting a faint miasma whenever she touched jade-bearing roughs.

A closer look made Lucy’s pupils constrict—this woman was harboring a dark familiar!

No wonder Fiona could accurately detect jade. She was relying on forbidden arts—the familiar sensed the energy and fed the information back to her.

Fiona noted down her chosen numbers, barely containing her excitement. The stones here were clearly superior.

When her fingers brushed the ugliest rock, her eyes flashed with triumph. "Buy this one—now!"

An elderly advisor frowned. "Miss, its appearance is poor—"

Fiona smoothed her hair. "I like it. Trust me."

Frederick Von, having witnessed his daughter’s accuracy before, smiled. "If Fiona wants it, get it."

Lily Green, inexplicably drawn to the same ugly stone, felt an instinctive urge to claim it—though she knew nothing about jade.

But both were too late.

Michael had already completed the purchase. Staff were attaching sold tags to the roughs.

Fiona was still gloating when her assistant rushed over, panicked. "Mr. Von, Miss Von—all the stones you picked were already bought!"

"What?" Fiona’s face darkened. "By whom?"

"Most by Topaz Jewelry’s Mr. York. That ugly one was taken by Lucy White."

Fiona’s eyes turned icy. She strode toward Lucy and lifted her chin. "Miss White, correct?"

Lucy arched a brow. "Yes?"

"You bought that rough?" Fiona pointed at the ugly stone.

"I did."

Fiona’s tone dripped condescension. "I want it. Sell it to me."

Lucy nearly laughed. "Why would I?"

Fiona pulled a checkbook from her Chanel bag. "Double the price. Enough?" Her voice reeked of entitlement.
###Chapter 176: Not Someone to Provoke

Lucy White nearly laughed out loud at Fiona Von's haughty demeanor.

"Not selling," she refused bluntly.

This raw jade had the strongest energy fluctuation in the entire auction floor—it would undoubtedly yield top-grade imperial jade.

Double the price? Even ten times wouldn't be enough.

Fiona's arrogance was a carbon copy of her shameless mother.

"Are you disrespecting me?" Fiona's face darkened instantly.

She lowered her voice threateningly, "I'm the heir to Gould Group. My grandfather knows the Wilson family patriarch."

"One word from me, and Topaz Entertainment will blacklist you."

In her eyes, Lucy was just a minor celebrity.

This defiance irritated her. Any other sensible star would've handed over the jade obediently—no questions asked.

"Go ahead and try," Lucy sneered. "Let's see if you can pull it off."

Did she think threats would work?

The Von and Gould families were cut from the same disgusting cloth.

"You—!" Fiona hadn't expected such defiance.

Gritting her teeth, she spat, "We'll see about that!"

But she couldn't bear to give up the stone. "Name your price. How much?"

"Not for any price," Lucy said coldly.

"Some things are priceless. This jade is mine." She even raised an eyebrow挑衅地.

Fiona trembled with rage. "How dare you!"

"Indeed, I dare. What will you do about it?" Lucy deliberately provoked her.

A crowd had gathered by now.

Lucy raised her voice mockingly, "The Von and Gould families have no standards—bullying others into selling what you fancy."

"With business practices like yours, bankruptcy is inevitable!"

Her words resonated with many. Everyone despised such entitled behavior.

Frederick Von, standing nearby, frowned. "Miss White, that's uncalled for."

"What? Threatening me too?" Lucy shot him a sidelong glance.

Frederick scowled. "A young lady should mind her manners."

"Takes one to know one," Lucy scoffed. "The fruit doesn't fall far from the tree. Look at your children's behavior—speaks volumes about the parents."

She wouldn't spare any courtesy for the Von family.

"You—!"

Just as Frederick was about to explode, he felt an icy gaze upon him.

"Watch your tone, Mr. Von. Reckless words bring consequences."

Frederick looked up to see an elegant young man staring at him coldly.

His heart skipped a beat—it was him!

At last year's elite gala, he'd witnessed this man surrounded by admirers beside the Smith Group CEO.

Inquiries revealed he was the youngest Smith son, the family's most doted-upon heir.

"Mr. Smith! What an honor to see you here," Frederick immediately fawned.

Ethan Smith replied indifferently, "Am I not allowed?"

"Of course! Your presence honors us all." Frederick wiped his brow.

Lucy rolled her eyes at his whiplash-inducing attitude change.

Michael Johnson approached with a mocking smile. "Your bootlicking skills have improved, Frederick."

Frederick noticed Michael and forced a laugh. "You flatter me, Mr. Johnson."

What rotten luck—running into both of them today.

"Lucy isn't selling. Drop it," Michael stated flatly.

Ethan twirled a pen between his fingers. "Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Von?"

For once, the two rivals stood united against an outsider.

Who did the Von family think they were, bullying Lucy?

"A misunderstanding! My daughter merely inquired," Frederick backpedaled. "Since Miss White prefers to keep it, we wouldn't dream of insisting."

Lucy delivered the final blow: "You couldn't insist even if you tried."

Frederick's expression darkened further, but he swallowed his pride.

The message was clear—these two heirs held Lucy in high regard.

Once they lost interest, he'd make this little star pay.

"Mr. Smith, Mr. Johnson, we'll take our leave."

Frederick maintained his smile until turning away, then his face twisted with fury.

Once out of earshot, Fiona whispered, "Father, who is that Mr. Smith?"

For her father to grovel like that—he must be formidable.

Frederick grimly explained Ethan's background.

"He's beyond our reach. While he protects that Lucy, don't act rashly," he warned.

Fiona's eyes gleamed with calculation. So the actor had powerful backing after all.

Schemes began forming in her mind.
###Chapter 177: The Replacement Game

Fiona Von's eyes flickered with amusement as Felix Von's face darkened like a storm cloud.

Once Frederick Von was out of earshot, Felix lowered his voice. "Sis, what should I do?"

Fiona arched a brow. "Really smitten?"

"Of course. I want her," Felix replied, stubbornness flashing in his eyes.

His unattainable first love was now behind bars, and despite his efforts, he couldn't get her out.

The family elders had warned him—if he interfered again, they'd strip him of his inheritance.

With two ambitious cousins eyeing his position, he had no choice but to accept it.

But Lucy White's eyes... they were the spitting image of his lost love.

If he couldn't have the original, a replacement would do.

Fiona's red lips curled. "Once we're back in the capital, find an opportunity to take her. Get some photos, some videos—she won't refuse."

"Those other girls you played with before, didn't they all fall in line?"

To her, people without connections were nothing more than playthings.

Felix's eyes lit up. He knew this game well—the other girls had all begged him not to expose them in the end.

"But Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson..."

Those two men were his biggest concerns.

Fiona's gaze turned dismissive. Her useless brother was good for nothing but causing trouble.

But that suited her just fine. Once she secured the Gould Group, she'd slowly swallow the Von empire whole.

"Men lose interest eventually. What's the rush?"

She couldn't let this idiot ruin her plans.

"Run it by me before you make a move."

Felix nodded eagerly. "Of course, of course."

Then Fiona remembered something. "Oh, and stay away from Hunter Wilde."

If Hunter could have her brother's woman thrown in prison just like that, he wasn't someone to trifle with.

Felix scoffed. "What kind of connections could he have? We've been classmates for years—"

"Shut up!" Fiona cut him off coldly. "Lay low for now. I'll look into it first."

Meanwhile, Evan York approached briskly.

"Trouble from the Vons?" He'd just finished a call when he saw the Von family members storm off.

Ethan's voice was calm. "They tried to strong-arm us into selling rough stones. We sent them packing."

Evan adjusted his glasses. "The Vons always resort to dirty tricks."

"If it weren't for leaving them to you, Hunter would've dealt with them already."

Ethan's lips quirked slightly. "The Vons are ours."

He remembered Lucy saying she wanted revenge herself.

"But don't hold back on the pressure," he added.

A slow bleed hurt the most.

Evan understood. Crossing this living executioner meant the Vons were finished.

His friend was clearly serious this time.

"Don't worry." A glint flashed behind his lenses.

Lucy and the others continued selecting rough stones. An hour later, Olivia Davis and Vanessa Knight pulled at her sleeve, pouting.

"Lucy, help us check these numbers~"

They handed her a notebook filled with serial codes.

After confirming their budgets, Lucy examined the raw jade carefully. Their luck wasn't bad—two or three out of thirty stones might yield something.

She picked five for each, plus an extra high-quality piece.

"If we strike jade, I'm making three pairs of bracelets!" Vanessa exclaimed excitedly.

Olivia grinned. "I'll craft three sets of earrings—I've already designed them!"

Lucy smiled. "Sounds perfect."

"When mine are cut, I'll carve you both protection charms myself."

"Ahhh, I love you!" Vanessa hugged her and planted a kiss on her cheek.

The three laughed together, their shadows stretching long under the golden sunlight.
###Chapter 178: Unbelievable Luck

Olivia Davis had witnessed firsthand the miraculous effects of Lucy White's protective talisman.

Unable to contain her excitement, she planted a kiss on Lucy's cheek. "I adore you too!"

She resolved to prepare an extravagant gift for Lucy later—such precious jade talismans couldn't possibly be accepted without reciprocation.

As for whether Lucy's stones would yield nothing? The thought never crossed their minds.

Their affectionate display, flanking Lucy on either side, drew scowls from Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson trailing behind them.

Michael muttered sourly, "Since when did girls become so shameless? Canoodling in public like this."

Not that he'd ever admit to jealousy. After all, he hadn't even held Lucy's hand yet.

Remembering his pretentious aloofness during their past relationship made him want to travel back in time and slap some sense into his younger self.

Ethan surprisingly agreed. "Quite improper."

He hadn't even gotten to hold his future wife's hand, yet these two women were stealing kisses.

Their complaints carried clearly to the trio ahead.

Vanessa Knight turned with a triumphant smirk. "Sour grapes!"

Olivia added with a playful wink, "Lucy belongs to us!"

Though truthfully, they too felt slightly embarrassed by their impulsive displays.

Lucy sighed, touching her cheek. "These are supposed to be reserved for my boyfriend."

Vanessa pinched her rosy cheek affectionately. "Noted. We'll leave them for him next time."

The three dissolved into laughter, warmth blooming in Lucy's chest. Having close girlfriends was wonderful—something she'd lacked in her previous life when Michael had been her sole focus.

Their merry gathering attracted numerous envious glances, including a particularly icy stare from Fiona Von.

Seeing Lucy and Vanessa's closeness twisted Fiona's gut. This minor celebrity certainly had tricks—not only ensnaring two well-connected men but also befriending the Knight heiress.

What infuriated her more was Lucy snatching up all the prime rough stones she'd earmarked. Her planned grand debut was off to a disastrous start. Something felt fundamentally wrong about how events were unfolding.

Her only hope now lay in the afternoon auction. Spotting Ethan conversing amiely with Evan York, her brow furrowed. These two knew each other? This "Ethan Smith" required deeper investigation.

Soon, all participants had selected their stones.

Robert Lee asked eagerly, "Shall we head to the cutting area?"

As first-time stone gamblers, everyone was itching to see results. Olivia and Vanessa tugged Lucy along enthusiastically.

Thanks to celebrity privilege, others yielded their spots willingly. The production crew summoned additional lapidaries.

"Who wants to go first?" the director asked.

Robert and others volunteered eagerly while Lucy smiled. "I bought the most—I'll go last."

The cutting commenced.

Of Robert's six stones, only one yielded bean jade—a net loss. Yet he remained cheerful. "Better than I expected!"

William Jones fared worse—all five stones were duds. "Stone gambling carries risks," he warned the cameras wryly.

Olivia hit three out of six. While the first two were mediocre, the last revealed ice jade.

"Oh my god! Lucy, I love you!" She hugged Lucy fiercely—this was precisely the stone Lucy had recommended.

Vanessa also scored three from seven stones, the final one being premium ruby jade.

"Lucy, you're magical!" She twirled excitedly. "This'll make bangles for all three of us!"

It matched exactly what she'd casually wished for earlier.

Exchanging stunned glances, the two women saw identical realization—Lucy's luck bordered on supernatural.
###Chapter 179: The Jade Gambit

"Emerald!" The stonecutter's shout drew every eye in the auction hall.

Lucy White and Vanessa Knight's freshly cut jade shimmered under the sunlight, eliciting gasps from the crowd. Jewelry merchants swarmed forward, their competing bids overlapping.

"Five million!"
"Eight million!"

The women exchanged knowing smiles. "Not for sale," they said in unison.

Robert Lee slapped his thigh in frustration. "Missed another golden opportunity! Should've followed Lucy's picks."

William Jones sighed. "Next time, I'm sticking to Lucy like glue."

[Live comments exploded]
[That's insane luck]
[Bet Lucy knows her stuff]

Livestream viewers debated Lucy's true expertise as Michael Johnson's turn arrived. His ten randomly selected rough stones yielded three jade pieces—one being premium glass-grade.

"Looks like fortune favors me today, Mr. Smith." Michael flashed a smug grin.

Ethan Smith calmly signaled the lapidary to proceed. When the black jade emerged, the room fell silent for a heartbeat before erupting in awe.

"Imperial black jade!"
"That clarity... that luster..."

Michael's expression darkened. Ethan toyed with the gem, lips quirking. "Seems my luck surpasses yours."

[Screen flooded with comments]
[Ethan god-tier as always]
[Top star Michael outshone again]

Evan York sidled closer. "About my selection—"

"Relax." Ethan cut him off. "You won't be disappointed."

Lily Green arrived late, pushing nine rough stones. Confidence radiated from her as she positioned herself by the cutting wheel, eyes blazing with determination.

"Eight out of nine!"
"Unbelievable streak!"

Her triumphant smile froze when Lucy's twenty-seven stones produced fourteen jade pieces—including one flawless imperial-grade specimen.

"Impossible!" Lily's nails bit into her palms.

Nearby, Fiona Von glared at that very stone—the one she'd coveted but Lucy claimed first.

"Investigate that Lily Green," Fiona hissed to her father. "As for Lucy... she'll regret this."

Two priceless gems glittered under the lights, illuminating two twisted faces—Lily trembling with rage, Fiona's eyes glinting venomously.

Meanwhile, Lucy absently twirled the imperial jade between her fingers. "Fortune smiles today."

Ethan chuckled. "Likewise."

The real game had only just begun.
###Chapter 180: Unbelievable Luck

Lucy White's exquisite jade shimmered under the sunlight, drawing a crowd of eager jewelers.

"Miss White, I'll pay double for this imperial jade!"
"Our firm can custom-design exclusive pieces. Would you consider—?"

Lucy shook her head with a faint smile. "My apologies, but these stones are reserved for another purpose."

From a distance, Evan York rubbed his hands together. "Ethan, do you think I could—"

"Don't even try," Ethan Smith cut him off. "She's using them for talismans."

"Talismans?" Evan's eyes lit up. "When they're finished, maybe—"

Ethan shot him a glance. "I'll ask, but it's her decision."

Evan lowered his voice. "You two still haven't made it official?"

"Patience." Ethan's lips curved slightly. "You'll get your wedding invitation."

Evan stifled a chuckle—even the legendary Ethan Smith could be thwarted in matters of the heart.

Nearby, the Von family worked on their stones.

"Father, while the quality isn't exceptional, the quantity makes up for it," Fiona Von murmured.

Frederick Von nodded approvingly. "You'll accompany me to the next auction."

Fiona's gaze drifted toward Lucy, her nails digging into her palms. "If only we hadn't lost those—"

"The afternoon auction will settle scores," Frederick sneered. "What capital could a mere actress possibly have?"

Meanwhile, Evan's lapidary team worked through their batch.

"Waste rock!"
"Another dud!"

After a dozen consecutive failures, whispers rippled through the crowd.

Frederick feigned sympathy. "Poor luck today, Mr. York."

Evan remained unruffled. "The best is yet to come."

He was proven right when Ethan's selections took center stage.

"Emerald hues!"
"Ice jade!"
"Heavens—another top-grade specimen!"

Over forty premium stones emerged in succession, Frederick's expression darkening with each revelation.

But Lucy's haul stole the show.

"Fifty! Fifty flawless pieces!"
"This defies probability!"

When two more imperial-grade jades appeared, the room erupted.

Evan grabbed Ethan's arm excitedly. "You're handing my company dominance in the jade trade!"

Jewelers swarmed like sharks, clamoring for partnerships. Evan navigated the frenzy with practiced ease, inwardly elated.

In the shadows, Fiona watched the adulation surrounding Lucy, her eyes venomous.

"The afternoon auction..." she muttered through clenched teeth.
###Chapter 181: Life and Death on the Line

Ethan Smith arched an eyebrow, a rare glint of pride flickering in his eyes.

"Of course. My wife has impeccable taste."

Evan York nearly choked on his tea. "..." Was this peacock-strutting tone really coming from the aloof Oscar-winning actor he knew?

Shaking his head with a chuckle, Evan conceded, "Alright, alright. You two are the ultimate power couple."

It seemed Lucy White hadn't just reversed Ethan's fortunes—she'd reshaped his entire personality.

"Ethan, care to join me at next month's Myanmar jade auction?" Evan swirled his teacup. "Let's carve up a few imperial-grade stones and leave the Von family starving."

Ethan, initially disinterested, sharpened his gaze. "Deal."

Nothing pleased him more than cutting off his enemies' lifelines.

Meanwhile, the director hurried over, excitement bubbling. "There's a small auction this afternoon. Interested?"

Robert Lee perked up. "Jade roughs?"

"Premium selections," the director whispered. "Rumor has it there's a showstopping glass-grade specimen."

Lucy toyed with the jade pendant around her neck. "Let's take a look."

Sunlight glinted off the polished stone, but its luster paled against the cunning spark in her eyes.

The director rubbed his hands. "Ms. White, any plans to sell the jade you uncovered?"

"Not for sale." She tucked the pendant into her collar. "I have other uses for it."

Robert winked conspiratorially. "Say no more!"

Their cryptic exchange piqued everyone's curiosity, though no one dared probe further with cameras rolling.

"Lunch first," the director announced. "Auction starts at three."

During the break, livestreams paused.

Lucy suddenly frowned, grabbing Ryan Clark as he passed. "Your brother—is he at the construction site today?"

Ryan blinked. "Uh, yeah? Why?"

"Call him. Now." Her voice turned urgent. "Tell him to evacuate his current position immediately."

Though bewildered, Ryan dialed. "Bro! Don't move!"

Construction clamor blared through the receiver. "What? I'm inspecting progress—"

"Run left! NOW!" Ryan's voice cracked with panic.

A deafening crash erupted through the phone, followed by screams.

"Holy—!" Ryan Clark Jr.'s voice shook. "The crane's steel beam just collapsed!"

The two-ton girder had smashed precisely where he'd stood seconds earlier, cratering the concrete half a meter deep.

Ryan's knees buckled.

"Ms. White... she told me to call..." He trembled. "Said you were in mortal danger..."

Silence. Then—

"Thank the seer for me." Ryan Jr. exhaled sharply. "I'll deliver my gratitude in person."

Hanging up, Ryan turned glassy eyes to Lucy. "You saved his life..."

Lucy traced invisible patterns in the air. "The calamity was fated, but today his stars shielded him."

Her fingertip brushed Ryan's forehead. "The shadow over your fraternal bond has lifted."

The lounge plunged into stunned silence.

Every trainee now regarded Lucy with something akin to reverence.
###Chapter 182: The Miraculous Divination

The trainees were resting in another area, completely unaware of what had just transpired. But all the guest stars had witnessed the astonishing scene—even Evan York, who had come specifically to chat with Ethan Smith, observed Lucy White's incredible foresight in its entirety.

"That's unbelievable!" Robert Lee whispered to Vanessa Knight beside him, his eyes wide. "She saved a life from thousands of miles away?"

Vanessa stared intently at Lucy, murmuring, "I've met many metaphysicians, but none as accurate as her."

Evan absentmindedly touched the jade material in his pocket, his gaze growing more fervent. He silently resolved to ask Ethan for an introduction—he needed to purchase more talismans blessed by Master Lucy.

"Ms. White, I can't thank you enough," Ryan Clark said, his voice thick with emotion. "If it weren't for you, my brother would've—"

Lucy waved it off. "It was nothing."

"I know the rules," Ryan said, pulling out his phone. "No reading goes unpaid. Name your price."

After a moment's thought, Lucy replied, "Here's what we'll do. Donate five million in my name, and have your brother match it. That settles the karmic debt while accumulating merit."

She paused, then explained, "In our line of work, revealing too much of fate invites backlash. Good deeds help counterbalance it."

"Done!" Ryan immediately texted his brother.

Within three minutes, his phone buzzed. Reading the message, Ryan exhaled in relief. "He says it'll be processed today. We'll forward the donation receipts."

"Lucy, that was terrifyingly impressive!" Vanessa gushed, eyes shining with admiration.

Lucy laughed at her exaggerated expression. "Keep praising me, and I might float away."

"Master White is too modest," Robert said earnestly. "After filming wraps, I'm booking a session with you."

Ryan suddenly lowered his voice. "Ms. White, could we speak privately?"

They moved to a secluded corner. Ryan's expression turned grave. "Since you knew about my brother, you must've sensed my two half-siblings too?"

Lucy nodded. "What do you want to ask?"

"I suspect..." He gritted his teeth. "This 'accident' wasn't accidental."

Lucy understood immediately. "You think your half-siblings were involved?"

"Exactly." Ryan smiled bitterly. "Our family situation is... complicated."

He briefly outlined the family feud—their father favored his first wife's children, leaving Ryan's mother and brothers marginalized. His third brother, a business prodigy, had become a particular target.

"Once we're back in the capital, I'll examine your brother in person," Lucy offered. "Face-to-face readings are more precise."

Ryan exhaled deeply. "Thank you!"

At 3 PM, staff ushered everyone into the auction hall, distributing bidding paddles.

Coincidentally, the Von family trio was seated right beside Lucy's group.
###Chapter 183: Are You Deliberately Provoking Me?

With Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson present, the Von family trio became noticeably more subdued.

Fiona Von excused herself to the restroom to touch up her makeup, returning in a figure-hugging dress that accentuated her curves. Clutching a pristine autograph book, her eyes sparkled with admiration as she approached Ethan.

"Mr. Smith, I'm your biggest fan," she said, offering the book. "Would you sign this for me?"

She had done her research on Ethan's preferences and deliberately chosen a limited-edition collector's item.

Ethan didn’t even glance up. "The auction is about to begin."

His meaning couldn’t have been clearer.

Fiona’s smile stiffened. She hadn’t expected her carefully planned "chance encounter" to backfire so spectacularly.

Michael snorted. "Shouldn’t fangirling wait for the right occasion?" He raised his voice pointedly. "Even an extra could act better than this."

A few muffled laughs rippled through the crowd.

Fiona’s grip on the autograph book tightened, her nails nearly piercing the cover. Forcing a smile, she retreated to her seat, mentally cursing both men a thousand times over.

Lucy White observed everything with quiet amusement, the corner of her lips curling slightly.

Fiona caught the expression and shot her a venomous glare.

Lucy didn’t flinch. Instead, she met Fiona’s gaze with a knowing smile.

The auction commenced.

The first ten raw jade stones were displayed on stage, allowing buyers to inspect them up close.

The Von family, accompanied by their gemologist, examined each piece meticulously. Fiona ran her fingers over every stone, faint tendrils of dark energy swirling around her fingertips.

Lucy narrowed her eyes. Not bad for a little parasite.

Evan York pulled Ethan and Lucy onto the stage.

"See anything you like?" Ethan murmured.

Lucy pointed to Lot 3. "That one’s mine."

Ethan nodded. "Lots 7 and 10 for Evan."

Evan: "..." Do I even exist to you two?

Back in their seats, the bidding began in earnest.

The first stone, of decent quality, sparked fierce competition.

Just as Evan raised his paddle, Ethan stopped him.

"Not this one."

Evan raised an eyebrow. "Since when do you know jade?"

Ethan deadpanned, "Just picked it up."

Evan: "..." Yeah, right.

When Lot 3 came up, Lucy placed the opening bid.

Lily Green immediately countered, sensing something unusual about the stone.

Fiona smirked and joined the fray.

The price quickly surpassed a million.

Lily bit her lip in frustration. She tried texting Michael for financial help, only to find herself blocked.

Damn it! She cursed inwardly, scrambling to contact her backup options.

Soon, only Lucy and Fiona remained in the battle.

At 1.8 million, Fiona finally snapped.

"Lucy!" she hissed through clenched teeth. "Are you deliberately provoking me?"

Lucy leisurely raised her paddle. "Two million."
###Chapter 184: She Could Wait

Fiona Von's words instantly chilled Lucy White's gaze.

"The auction rules are simple—highest bidder wins," Lucy replied with a cold smile, her crimson lips curving though her eyes remained icy. "If it's too expensive for you, feel free to drop out."

She hadn't planned to interfere, but Fiona's arrogant demeanor was insufferable.

Did this woman really think she was untouchable?

Lucy's fingers brushed lightly over her small handbag, and a wisp of miasmic energy slithered unseen into Fiona's body.

If this woman relied on blood magic to gamble on jade, Lucy would make sure she never could again.

Fiona shuddered but dismissed it as the venue's air conditioning.

"You really want to cross me?" Fiona hissed, keeping her voice low to avoid drawing Ethan Smith and Michael Johnson's attention.

Lucy chuckled. "You overestimate your importance, Fiona."

"Take your brother's advice and look in the mirror first," she added breezily, each word a deliberate stab. "Self-awareness is a virtue."

Fiona's face darkened with rage. "You'll regret this!"

Just a minor celebrity—she had plenty of ways to ruin her.

The bidding war escalated until the price hit three million, which Lucy secured effortlessly.

Fiona tried to counter, but Frederick Von and their gemologist stopped her.

"Three million is excessive," Frederick frowned.

Fiona shot Lucy a venomous glare, unaware that the jade inside that rough stone was far more valuable than she imagined. Lucy had just made an incredible profit.

Lucy abstained from the seventh and tenth lots, but Evan York aggressively outbid the Von family for both.

Three consecutive losses left the Vons fuming.

"Dad, we have to win the next one," Fiona insisted urgently.

Frederick sighed. "Your uncles are watching our spending. If we bid too high, they'll use it against us."

"But if we uncover premium jade, what can they say?" Fiona argued confidently.

After a moment's hesitation, Frederick agreed.

Then, without warning, Fiona's head throbbed violently, and the small wooden barrel at her waist trembled uncontrollably. Gritting her teeth, she muttered an incantation and tossed a black pill inside.

The familiar finally stilled, and her pain gradually subsided—but an inexplicable dread settled in her chest.

When the second batch of rough stones was unveiled, the crowd surged forward to inspect them.

Lucy shook her head after a brief assessment and subtly signaled Ethan, who relayed the best picks to Evan.

Meanwhile, Fiona pressed her palm against a stone, waiting in vain for her familiar's guidance.

"Tell me which one has jade!" she mentally screamed.

All she received was a weak "hurts" before the connection went silent.

Panic set in.

When the five-minute window ended, Fiona returned to her seat pale-faced.

"Which ones should we bid on?" Frederick asked.

She bit her lip. "This batch... isn't promising. Let the gemologist decide."

Frederick trusted her judgment—only to walk away nearly empty-handed. Evan, following Ethan's tips, secured several high-quality stones.

Lucy participated in five more auctions before withdrawing. She knew when to quit.

Fiona, however, was spiraling.

No matter how she threatened or coaxed, her familiar refused to cooperate.

"Dad, I feel dizzy—" Her face drained of color before she collapsed.

Frederick shouted for help as attendants rushed her to the hospital.

Lucy watched coldly.

Fiona had no one to blame but herself.

Elsewhere, Lily Green—relying on "borrowed" millions—bid on stones purely by instinct.

Lucy attempted to disrupt her with miasma, only to find Lily's luck neutralizing it effortlessly.

Typical protagonist光环.

But it didn't matter. Once Lily's luck waned further...

Lucy could be patient.

That day wouldn't be long.
###Chapter 185: Unexpected Reunion

The auction lasted until dusk.

The final lots of premium jade fetched astronomical prices, causing a stir among the attendees. Frederick Von was forced to purchase several raw stones at thirty percent above market value, his face darkening with barely concealed frustration.

"Ms. White, should we cut these stones now?" Evan York asked, watching the workers load the uncut jade into the vehicle.

Lucy shook her head. "Let's take them back to the capital first." She glanced at the still-rolling cameras. "Cutting them here would draw too much attention."

Evan nodded in understanding and offered his contact details. "Our company has a workshop in Panjiayuan. You're welcome to use it anytime."

On the ride back, the director grinned from ear to ear. "Tonight's dinner is on the production crew—order whatever you like!"

"Wow, did the sun rise from the west today?" Michael Johnson arched a brow. "Must've broken viewership records, huh?"

William Jones chimed in, "The director's just milking us for ratings. We got played today."

"That's unfair!" The director waved his hands dramatically. "This is just a little reward for everyone's hard work."

Exchanging amused glances, the group unanimously chose a Michelin three-star restaurant. As they scanned the eye-watering prices on the menu, the director's smile stiffened.

"This one, and this." Lucy tapped the menu with slender fingers. "Double the Australian lobster."

Ethan Smith, seated beside her, gazed at her with warmth. "You can have mine too."

"Then I won't hold back." She winked at him, their chemistry drawing knowing smiles from the others.

On the way back to the inn, Ethan's assistant drove while the two sat alone in the backseat.

"Mr. York wants to commission a few jade pieces." Ethan swiped through designs on his tablet. "These are the styles he requested."

Lucy leaned closer to inspect them. "My schedule's packed lately—I might not have time to carve them." A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes. "Why don’t you do it? I remember your carving skills are exceptional."

"Gladly." His gaze softened. "How about I handle your pending projects too?"

"Deal." She agreed readily. "In return, I'll make something for you."

Ethan's eyes lit up. "Can I request a ring?"

"Dream on!" She huffed. "Pick something else."

"Then... a thumb ring?" He compromised.

Lucy sighed in mock exasperation. "Fine. But don’t blame me if it turns out poorly."

"I’ll love anything you make." His voice was tender enough to melt ice.

Back at the inn, Michael intercepted Lucy before she could retreat to her room.

In the softly lit reading nook, his expression was hesitant.

"About the jade we uncovered today..." He nervously traced the rim of his teacup. "You can have all of it."

Seeing the once-proud young man now so cautious, Lucy felt a pang in her chest.

"No need," she refused gently. "I have enough for myself."

"Then... let me make you a star pendant?" Hope flickered in his eyes. "You used to love—"

"I don’t like stars anymore." Her quiet interruption was firm.

"What do you like, then?"

"The moon." The answer slipped out before she could think.

Michael gave a bitter smile. "Aren’t stars and moons both in the sky...?"

"Top scorer in the national exams, and this is your logic?" She teased, trying to lighten the mood.

They chatted about trivial matters, carefully avoiding the past that could never be reclaimed.

The next morning, the crew set out for their next destination.

The third stop at Heritage Mountain—the traditional Medicine Pavilion—loomed ahead, its antique gates imposing.

Just as Lucy stepped forward, a familiar figure in the crowd made her freeze.

Her pupils contracted sharply, and her parasol clattered to the ground.
###Chapter 186: Chance Encounter or Calculated Move?

The moment Lucy White's group stepped out of the vehicle, they came face-to-face with three men.

The leader was a tall young man with sharp, frost-like features. Behind him stood a bespectacled assistant and a muscular bodyguard.

When their eyes met, the man's gaze instantly locked onto Lucy.

"Lucy White." His voice was crisp as winter air.

Lucy's pupils contracted slightly. "Ian Stone?"

The stern lines of his face softened. "I'm surprised you remember me."

"How could I forget a high school classmate?" Lucy offered a polite smile.

Ian coughed twice, sickly pink blooming across his pale cheeks. "What a coincidence meeting you here."

Live comments exploded:

[Who's this gorgeous sickly prince?]
[I need his full bio in 3 seconds!]
[That face could kill me]

Lucy frowned internally. This was the same man who'd moved with panther-like grace on the survival island.

"Here for medical treatment?" she probed.

"Yes." Another cough wracked his frame. "Just returned from abroad. Heard the traditional medicine here is exceptional."

Ethan Smith narrowed his eyes. The agile fighter from the wilderness now played the frail invalid.

Michael Johnson inserted himself between them. "If you're here for treatment, we shouldn't keep you."

Ian's gaze turned glacial, then warmed when addressing Lucy: "Perhaps we could catch up later?"

"Sure." Lucy agreed readily.

The assistant knocked on the vermilion gate. A young apprentice accepted their referral letter before ushering Ian's party inside with deference.

Moments later, the apprentice returned beaming at the production crew: "Please come in. Dean Xavier will see you shortly."

The courtyard greeted them with an aromatic blend of herbs. Stone pathways flanked by drying medicinal plants led to equipment for processing traditional remedies.

"Herbal tea," the apprentice offered cool beverages.

Robert Lee smacked his lips. "Anyone here know traditional medicine?"

Blank stares all around.

"Looks like we're relying on Professor Lucy and Professor Ethan," William Jones chuckled.

Ethan inclined his head. "I have some basic knowledge."

Lucy twirled her teacup. "I've dabbled a bit."

Fifteen minutes later, white-haired Dean Xavier arrived.

"To enter our hospital, you must first pass the herb test." The elder gestured at the botanical display. "How many can you identify?"

Ethan stood first, accurately naming dozens of herbs with their properties.

When Lucy's turn came, she even described preparation methods flawlessly.

Dean Xavier applauded. "Solid foundations. However—" his eyes gleamed sharply, "the real test lies ahead."
###Chapter 187: A Pleasant Surprise

"Oh my God, they actually know every single one!"

"This is incredible!"

Gasps of amazement filled the room. The guests and trainees watched in awe as Lucy White and Ethan Smith effortlessly identified each medicinal herb, even the most obscure varieties, along with their exact properties.

Dean Xavier adjusted his glasses, surprise flickering in his eyes. He had expected just another routine reality show recording, but instead, he found two genuine experts.

"Lucy is amazing!"
"Ethan is the GOAT!"

Cheers erupted around them. Everyone was thoroughly impressed by their professionalism, eagerly anticipating their leadership to guide the team through the challenges.

"Next up is the diagnosis segment," Dean Xavier said with a smile. "We happen to have a few patients willing to participate."

Lucy and Ethan exchanged a glance and nodded in silent agreement.

Soon, four patients were escorted in by the crew. To Lucy's surprise, Ian Stone was among them.

"This lady, please proceed to Dr. White's station," a staff member directed.

Without hesitation, Ian walked toward Lucy's table, while the other two male patients went to Ethan's side.

Ethan began his diagnosis first. His slender fingers rested on the patient's wrist, and within moments, he accurately pinpointed the ailment.

"Weak spleen and stomach, loss of appetite, accompanied by diarrhea..."

The patient's jaw dropped. "That's exactly right!"

The livestream exploded with comments:
[Ethan knows traditional medicine too?!]
[His pulse-reading technique is so professional!]
[I can't—what kind of celestial idol is this?!]

Dean Xavier took the prescription Ethan wrote, nodding approvingly. "Precise dosage, perfectly balanced formula."

When it was Lucy's turn, she first checked the female patient's pulse, then carefully observed her complexion and palms.

"Emphysema causing breathing difficulties, endocrine imbalance leading to weight gain..."

The patient nodded excitedly. "Yes, yes! Doctor, you're spot on!"

Lucy wrote two prescriptions—one for oral medication and another for a therapeutic soak. Dean Xavier's eyes lit up as he reviewed them. "Brilliant! Even I couldn't have formulated this."

"Dr. White, you're too modest," the dean praised. "This level of expertise is far beyond 'just a little knowledge.'"

Finally, it was Ian's turn. As Lucy placed her fingers on his wrist, her brow furrowed slightly.

"Angina?" she asked, detecting something unusual. "Have you recently lost consciousness too?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Ian's eyes. "You can tell that just from my pulse?"

The corner of his lips curled into a faint, enigmatic smile. He had only intended to get closer to her, but this unexpected discovery intrigued him.

"Dr. White," Ian murmured, lowering his voice. "Could we speak privately?"
###Chapter 188: A Stunning Performance

Lucy White's slender fingers rested lightly on Ian Stone's wrist, the icy temperature making her frown slightly.

"Your condition...is unusual," she said, meeting his fathomless gaze.

The pale man's lips curved into a faint smile. "That's why I came to you."

Withdrawing her hand, Lucy rubbed her fingertips thoughtfully. This wasn't an ordinary illness—it was something else entirely.

"Acupuncture combined with herbal treatment," she said deliberately, pausing for effect. "And it will require an extended regimen."

Dean Xavier's eyes lit up. "Remarkable! Your diagnosis aligns perfectly with my own findings!"

Ian never took his eyes off Lucy's face. "Then I'll be in your capable hands, old friend." He emphasized the last two words, a familiar glint of mischief in his eyes.

As Lucy began writing the prescription with swift strokes, Dean Xavier peered over her shoulder.

"Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!" The dean slapped the table in admiration. "This herb combination never occurred to me!"

Ethan Smith stood beside Lucy, his gaze lingering briefly on Ian before casually shifting away.

"Dean Xavier," Ian suddenly spoke up, "I'd like Lucy to be my primary physician."

The dean chuckled. "If Lucy agrees, our hospital would be honored!"

[OMG! This plot twist!]
[Since when was Lucy an expert in traditional medicine?!]
[Dean Xavier is a legendary physician—even he's impressed!]
[Did you see Ethan's expression? I'm deceased!]
[The way Ian looks at her...so much history there!]

The live comments exploded into chaos.

Finishing the prescription, Lucy looked up. "I'll also need a set of silver needles."

"Right away!" The dean immediately instructed an assistant. "Lucy, have you considered joining our hospital as a consultant?"

The offer made everyone present gasp.

The Medicine Pavilion was the pinnacle of traditional medicine!

Lucy exchanged a glance with Ethan. In perfect unison, they replied, "We'll consider it."

[Power couple alert!]
[They're so in sync!]
[Ethan's gaze is so protective!]
[I ship them so hard!]

Lily Green stood in the shadows, nails digging into her palms. How could Lucy possibly master traditional medicine too?

"Then it's settled." Ian reached out, lightly grasping Lucy's wrist. "My life is in your hands."

The unnatural chill in his touch made Lucy's breath catch. This wasn't right...

Ethan's eyes sharpened momentarily before his expression smoothed over.

"Don't worry," Lucy said professionally, withdrawing her hand. "I'll cure you."

What she didn't say was that this illness likely hid darker secrets.

Dean Xavier beamed. "What a fortunate day! Not only have we discovered two medical prodigies, but Ian's chronic condition may finally be resolved!"

The livestream comments now moved too fast to read.

[Lucy, take me as your disciple!]
[Officially a Lucy stan from today!]
[She's not a celebrity—she's a hidden genius!]
[Ethan and Lucy are perfect together!]

Backstage, the producer grinned at the skyrocketing ratings. "I knew Lucy would deliver!"

Sophia Taylor lifted her chin proudly. "This is just the beginning. Lucy has many more talents."

On Heritage Mountain, the setting sun cast long shadows.

Lucy watched Ian's retreating figure with a frown. This "old friend" clearly harbored secrets.

Unnoticed by her, Ethan's gaze remained fixed on her profile, something unreadable flickering in his eyes.
###Chapter 189: The Truth

The Medicine Pavilion of Heritage Mountain was filled with the soothing aroma of herbs.

Lucy White stepped into the ancient courtyard with her companions, her eyes immediately drawn to the rare medicinal plants thriving in the garden. The aged herbs glistened under the sunlight, their luster captivating her.

"These herbs..." she murmured softly, her fingers unconsciously brushing against the small medicine pouch at her side.

Dean Xavier personally welcomed them and led the group to the archives. The weighty medical texts exuded the scent of ink as Lucy flipped open a page, her eyes lighting up with admiration.

"Ethan," she whispered, tugging lightly at Ethan Smith's sleeve. "Come with me."

The director, noticing their movement, tactfully shifted the camera away. The live comments exploded instantly:

[Where's Lucy's dad? I want to see him!]
[Ethan disappeared again!]

Meanwhile, Michael Johnson stood beneath the corridor, his gaze dark as he watched the two walk away. Spotting Ian Stone also staring in their direction, he scoffed and approached him.

"Stay away from her," Michael said coldly.

Ian didn't even turn. "And who are you to say that?"

"Better than you," Michael clenched his fists. "Back off."

Finally, Ian looked at him, a dangerous glint in his eyes. "Try me."

The tension between them crackled before Michael turned away with a derisive snort. Ian watched him leave, a mocking smile curling his lips.

Elsewhere, Lucy pulled Ethan into a secluded corner.

"You want to join the Medicine Pavilion?" Ethan guessed her thoughts effortlessly.

Lucy raised an eyebrow in surprise. "How did you know?"

"Just a hunch," he chuckled. "And you want to buy herbs too?"

"Ethan," Lucy narrowed her eyes. "You seem to know me well."

His gaze softened. "Better than you think."

Her heart skipped a beat before she suddenly asked, "Your knowledge of medicine... you didn't learn it in this world, did you?"

The air froze.

Ethan's pupils contracted briefly before he laughed. "I should've known I couldn't hide it from you."

"You've been there too?" Her voice tightened.

"Yes," he nodded. "I've met you in every world."

Lucy's breath hitched. "Then I'm—"

"Lucy," he said gently. "Always you."

She took a half-step back. "Why don't I remember?"

"Your emotional memories were locked," Ethan explained, his eyes deep. "I only started remembering recently."

Her heart pounded wildly. She should have realized sooner—the inexplicable familiarity, the instinctive trust...

"Why did you take on those missions?" Her voice trembled.

"To survive," he answered honestly, briefly explaining the car accident and the system.

After a long silence, Lucy suddenly smiled. "Seems we're fated."

"More than that," Ethan gazed at her intently. "Lucy, I'll wait for you to remember."

Dappled sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting patterns over them. Lucy met his eyes and gave a small nod.

In that moment, something between them quietly shifted.
###Chapter 190: The Scheme

No sooner had Michael Johnson left than Lily Green appeared before Ian Stone in her stilettos.

With no cameras around, she could finally drop all pretenses.

"Ian!" she cooed, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.

Ian looked up, brows slightly furrowed.

Lily settled beside him without invitation, her skirt brushing against his trousers.

"You came to see me, didn't you?" She tilted her head, flashing what she believed was her most charming smile.

Ian subtly shifted away.

"I saw the name on the medical records," Lily whispered, batting her lashes. "Don't worry—your secret's safe with me."

Ian paused mid-movement, halting his attempt to stand.

"Thanks," he said flatly.

"Since when do we stand on formalities?" Lily playfully swatted his arm.

Ian suppressed the urge to recoil.

"And what exactly is our relationship?" he countered.

Lily flushed, biting her lip. "After... after everything, you're still playing dumb?"

Ian nearly choked on his own saliva.

"I'm here for medical treatment," he deflected.

Lily instantly adopted a concerned expression. "What's wrong?"

"My heart." Ian gestured to his chest. "Lucy White says she can treat it."

At the mention of Lucy's name, a shadow flickered in Lily's eyes.

"Is she even qualified?" she feigned worry. "Maybe you should see Dean Xavier instead?"

Ian shook his head. "Dean Xavier recommended her."

Lily's fingers tightened around her skirt.

"You and Lucy..." she ventured, "are you really just classmates?"

"Yeah." His tone remained indifferent.

Lily pouted. "I don't like her. She's always bullying me."

A glacial glint flashed through Ian's eyes.

"What do you want?" he asked.

Lily's gaze grew calculating. "Ian, you should pursue her."

"Pursue her?"

"Yes!" Lily said excitedly. "Once she cures you, dump her. Let her taste what it feels like to be played!"

A cold smile curled Ian's lips.

"Brilliant idea," he said.

Too absorbed in her triumph, Lily missed the dangerous shift in his demeanor.

Footsteps approached in the distance, prompting her to scramble upright.

"I should go." She hurried off, her heels clacking urgently against the stone path.

Ian watched her retreating figure, his expression turning arctic.

Meanwhile, Lucy White and Ethan Smith sat in Dean Xavier's office.

"Welcome aboard!" The dean beamed as he handed them two forms.

Lucy finished filling hers out swiftly and cut to the chase. "I heard your institute houses rare medicinal herbs?"

Dean Xavier stroked his beard. "Those are our treasures."

"Are they for sale?" Lucy asked bluntly.

The dean shook his head. "Not normally, no."

Curious, he inquired, "What do you need?"

Lucy exchanged a glance with Ethan.

"Century-old lingzhi," she said. "To save a life."

Dean Xavier's expression sobered. "That urgent?"

Outside the window, a shadow flitted past unnoticed.
###Chapter 191: But You've Changed So Much

Lucy White got straight to the point.

"I have several ancient medicinal recipes that can produce vitality-boosting elixirs, but they require high-quality, aged herbs."

"I'd like to make an exchange with the Medicine Pavilion."

Dean Xavier's eyes lit up. "What kind of elixirs?"

Lucy took out a porcelain vial and handed it to him. "Vitality Elixir. It regulates the body and prolongs life."

The dean's hand trembled slightly.

He carefully poured out a pill onto a white porcelain dish, examining it closely.

"May I study this? If it proves effective, the Medicine Pavilion would be willing to negotiate."

Lucy nodded readily. "You can keep these two as samples."

She knew firsthand experience was necessary to believe in its potency.

After leaving the Medicine Pavilion, the production crew moved to the Tea Pavilion.

Lucy and Ethan Smith's tea ceremony performance dazzled the audience, effortlessly earning them entry qualifications.

Back at the inn, Ian Stone sent her an invitation.

At the bookstore café, Ian was sipping coffee while reading—a scene that momentarily transported Lucy back to their youth.

"What did you want to talk about?" she asked, taking a seat.

Ian slid a cup of coffee toward her. "Can't old friends catch up?"

Lucy took a sip. It still tasted the same as she remembered.

After reminiscing, Ian suddenly asked, "Do you have a grudge against Lily Green?"

Lucy arched a brow. "Did she ask you to target me?"

"She wants me to pursue you, then publicly humiliate you," Ian admitted bluntly.

Lucy smirked. "Sounds like her style. Did you agree?"

"Only on the surface," Ian said seriously. "Be careful with her—she's dangerous."

Lucy met his gaze directly. "What's your relationship with her?"

Ian averted his eyes. "Some things... I can't explain."

"But I would never help her hurt you," he vowed solemnly.

Lucy changed the subject. "How much do you know about your own condition?"

Ian countered, "What have you noticed?"

"That curse you're under—are you aware of it?"

His pupils contracted slightly. "You can even see that?"

Lucy lifted her chin proudly. "I'm a top-tier metaphysician."

Ian chuckled. "Still as confident as ever."

Lucy studied him meaningfully. "But you've changed so much."

Ian smiled bitterly. "Some changes... weren't by choice."

The melancholy in his eyes made Lucy's chest tighten.
###Chapter 192: You Noticed It Too?

Lucy didn't press Ian about his past experiences.

"The curse on you runs deep. It's been there for quite some time—not easy to remove."

At her current level of cultivation, she couldn't completely break Ian's curse.

But she sensed a breakthrough was imminent. Once she ascended to the Mortal Realm, lifting his curse would be effortless.

Ian's lips curved slightly. "No rush."

The difficulty meant more opportunities to stay close to Lucy.

"I'll give you a jade locket in a few days. It'll temporarily suppress the curse—no more heart pains or fainting spells."

"After that, come for regular acupuncture sessions. When the time is right, we'll remove it completely," Lucy said.

Ian nodded. "Understood."

Lucy pulled up her QR code. "Let's exchange contacts. I'll notify you before each session."

He scanned it and added her. "Done."

"By the way," Lucy suddenly asked, "why did you say Lily isn't simple?"

Ian's gaze darkened. "She has powerful backers. There's something about her that draws certain people."

Lucy raised a brow. "You mean her karmic aura?"

He blinked. "You noticed it too?"

He'd already observed the unusually thick aura surrounding Lily—a magnet for those with ill intentions.

Lucy was even more surprised. "You can see it?"

Realizing his slip, Ian simply admitted, "Yes, I have some knowledge in this area."

Lucy suddenly grabbed his wrist, pressing a fingertip to his palm.

A faint crimson sigil surfaced.

Her expression shifted. "You're a blood mage?"

Ian gave a wry smile. "Not exactly. Just basic understanding."

Lucy smirked. "A CEO and a blood mage. Impressive."

She tactfully avoided mentioning his other identity as the Black Horizon Overlord.

Ian met her eyes. "Likewise."

"When are you leaving town?" Lucy asked.

"Tomorrow," Ian replied. "The company just relocated back home—lots to handle."

"Then I'll give you the jade when we're back in the capital. For now, take this talisman."

She paused. "Don't use any blood magic. It'll worsen the curse's backlash."

Ian nodded. "Understood."

He added, "Contact me anytime if needed."

"Sure."

After lingering a while longer, Lucy headed back to the inn.

At her door, Michael stood waiting.

"Something wrong?"

His gaze was intense. "Waiting for you."

He asked bluntly, "Were you with Ian?"

Lucy didn't deny it. "Yes."

Michael frowned. "He's no good—always faking illness for sympathy. Don't fall for it."

That guy had used tricks to get close to Lucy years ago. Clearly scheming.

Lucy rolled her eyes. "Since when do you police my life?"

Michael looked wounded. "I'm just looking out for you."

Lucy sighed. "Fine, fine. I know he's got ulterior motives. Thanks for the warning."

Since when had Michael become so overbearing?

He opened his mouth but only said, "Just be careful."

"Goodnight." She waved him off and entered her room.

Michael sighed and headed downstairs, running into Ethan.

On impulse, he invited, "Drink with me?"

Ethan raised a brow. "Why?"

Though he disliked Ethan, compared to Ian, the man seemed almost tolerable. "Just talking. You don't want Ian near Lucy either, right?"

Ethan chuckled. "I respect Lucy's choices. Even if that guy is insufferable, I won't interfere."

He could sense Ian's interest in Lucy.

But even if he and Lucy were together, he'd never control her friendships.

Besides, Lucy was sharp—and aware of Ian's true identity. No way she'd be fooled.

He trusted her.

"Don't overstep," Ethan said meaningfully before walking away.

Michael stared after him, reconsidering his own behavior.

No wonder Lucy treated Ethan differently. The man was shrewd.

Late that night, Lily sneaked out to find Ian, craving his touch.

But his bodyguard informed her he was out. Defeated, she returned.

From his window, Ian watched her leave through the curtains before showering.

At dawn, he departed quietly, texting Lucy before leaving.

The crew took everyone to Heritage Mountain.

Their van stopped before the Martial Arts Pavilion.

Lily's eyes lit up.

Finally—her moment to shine.

William smiled. "This round favors Michael and Lily. Want to give it a try?"

Lily feigned modesty. "I'll try my best to get us in."

Michael said calmly, "Sure. Good chance to test my skills."

Vanessa, disliking Lily's act, whispered to Lucy, "Aren't you trying?"

Both Lucy and Ethan had claimed martial arts experience.

Lucy smiled. "Let them go first."

Vanessa grinned. "Got it. Can't wait to see the show."

Something felt off about Lily's supposed passion for martial arts.

The gates opened.

A young man and woman greeted them.

The girl beamed. "Welcome to the Martial Arts Pavilion! Please, come in!"

Clearly prepared.

As they entered, the boy announced, "The test is simple: defeat either of us in combat using traditional techniques."
###Chapter 193: What an Epic Display of Incompetence

A collective gasp swept through the audience.

The moment the young man finished speaking, the guests exchanged bewildered glances. These two martial arts students looked no older than seventeen or eighteen—how skilled could they possibly be?

Michael Johnson's eyes lit up. As an expert, he immediately recognized their exceptional prowess.

Turning to Lily Green with a smirk, he said, "Didn't you always boast about your martial arts skills, Miss Green? Why don't you go first?"

This woman never missed a chance to flaunt her supposed talents. Today, he'd make sure she humiliated herself properly.

Lily blushed, mistaking his words for an opportunity to shine.

"Then I'll show you what I can do," she said coyly.

Michael nodded solemnly. "Go ahead. Give it your best shot."

Vanessa Knight nearly choked on her laughter, quickly covering her mouth. She leaned toward Lucy White and whispered, "Michael's tongue is lethal."

Lucy chuckled. "That's just how he is."

So this was how Lily had endured Michael's sharp remarks in their past life—by deluding herself. Absolutely priceless.

Lily strode confidently to the center, striking what she thought was a heroic pose—though it only looked awkward—before clasping her fists at the young female disciple. "Let's spar!"

The girl returned the gesture, then effortlessly flipped onto the platform with a single light step.

Lily froze. She had no such ability and could only shuffle up the stairs in humiliation.

Lucy's fingers twitched imperceptibly as a misfortune sigil dissolved into Lily's body. This woman's luck was too strong—it needed tempering.

Both chose spears as their weapons. Lily swung hers in a flashy but impractical display, thoroughly pleased with herself.

The disciple simply thrust forward.

"Ah!" Lily fumbled to block, only for her spear to fly from her grip instantly.

The girl's weapon stopped just shy of Lily's throat. "I yield to your generosity."

Lily gritted her teeth. "I—I'm better with swords. Let's switch!"

After exchanging weapons, she launched into another theatrical routine. The disciple had seen enough—with one precise flick, Lily's sword clattered to the ground.

The metallic ring echoed through the silent hall.

Lily forced a smile. "You martial arts students are truly impressive—"

Before she could finish, a middle-aged man stormed in.

"Martial arts isn't for showboating!" he snapped. "You're insulting the discipline!"

The disciple quickly introduced, "This is Vice Dean Griffith."

Lily paled. How dare this old man reprimand her on live broadcast!

Clap. Clap. Clap.

Michael suddenly applauded.

"Well said!" He looked genuinely impressed. "Martial arts isn't circus tricks. Some people really need to hear that."

Then, twisting the knife: "And what an epic display of incompetence that was."

Lily finally broke, tears spilling over. "I was only trying to help—"

"Help?" Michael scoffed. "With skills like yours? Don't disgrace martial arts."

Vice Dean Griffith nodded approvingly. At least someone here had sense.

Lily trembled with rage. "If you're so great, why don't you try?"

She'd never hated anyone's words more than Michael's at this moment.
###Chapter 194: A Display of Brilliance

Michael Johnson had never been one to indulge Lily Green's antics—not in the past, and certainly not now.

"Bring it on," he said, casting her a sidelong glance, his lips curling into a mocking smirk. "Watch closely."

Before anyone could react, he vaulted onto the sparring platform with effortless grace.

"Let's begin," he said, clasping his fists in a traditional salute toward his opponent.

The audience—both on-site and watching the livestream—was stunned.

No one had expected the top-tier celebrity to actually possess real skill.

The young novice returned the gesture, and the two immediately engaged in combat.

The spear sliced through the air with razor-sharp precision, the clang of metal ringing clear.

[Oh my god! This is real martial arts!]
[Lily's performance earlier was child's play compared to this.]
[No wonder Michael looked down on her act.]
[That spear technique is insane!]

Twenty moves later, Michael executed a flawless upward strike, sending his opponent's weapon flying.

"My thanks for the match," he said, retracting his spear with a confident smile.

"Excellent!" Vice Dean Griffith applauded. "Young Michael, are you skilled with the sword as well?"

Michael arched a brow. "I know a thing or two."

"Then how about another round?" The vice dean gestured to a young woman below the platform. "She's our finest sword practitioner."

It was obvious to everyone—this was meant to be a harsh lesson for Lily.

"With pleasure," Michael said, accepting the blade. The duel began instantly.

Their swords gleamed like winter frost, their movements too swift to follow.

In the end, the young woman conceded defeat, bowing in genuine respect.

Lily's face turned ashen, her nails digging bloody crescents into her palms.

The carefully crafted persona she'd built was crumbling before her eyes.

Soon, two topics trended:
#MichaelJohnsonRealSkills
#LilyGreenFakeMartialArts

"Well done," Lucy White murmured.

She was referring to how Michael had successfully weakened Lily's influence.

But Michael misunderstood—his face lit up like a child who'd just been handed candy.

Lucy praised him!

As the tour continued, the audience clamored for Lucy and Ethan Smith to demonstrate their skills.

Reluctantly, they obliged, their masterful techniques earning thunderous applause.

[Lucy's been hiding her talent!]
[And she called this "just a little"?]
[Lily looks ready to explode!]

At the Porcelain Pavilion, Lucy shone even brighter.

Her encyclopedic knowledge of ceramics—even the most obscure details—left everyone in awe.

That evening, back at their lodgings, the production crew treated them to local delicacies.

Outside the restroom, Lily cornered Lucy.

"Don't get too cocky!" she hissed through gritted teeth.

Lucy shot her a frosty glare. "Get help if you're unwell. Don't take it out on me."

Lily trembled with rage but could only watch as Lucy walked away.

Her fists clenched tighter, nails carving deeper into her flesh.

This wasn't over. She would have her revenge.
###Chapter 195: Clash of Wills

Morning sunlight spilled over the cobblestone path as the production crew ascended the winding mountain trail.

The gilded characters "Embroidery Pavilion" gleamed under the sun. A young woman in an embroidered cheongsam stood at the entrance, smiling warmly at the group.

Lily Green clicked forward in her high heels, deliberately sidling up to Vanessa Knight. "Ms. Knight, you'll surely dazzle us today," she said, her lips curving into a faint smirk as she glanced at the cameras.

Vanessa toyed with the jade bracelet on her wrist and chuckled. "Such high praise, Ms. Green. Still bitter about yesterday?"

Their gazes locked, tension crackling between them.

Lily's expression faltered briefly before she forced a sweet smile. "You misunderstand. I genuinely admire your talent."

"Is that so?" Vanessa arched a brow. "Then you'd better watch closely."

Lucy White moved discreetly to Vanessa's side and whispered something in her ear. Vanessa's eyes lit up, and she gave Lucy a playful wink.

The challenge was soon revealed: embroider a duck.

Lily suppressed a smug grin. The task seemed simple but held hidden complexities. She couldn't wait to see Vanessa stumble.

But the next moment wiped the smile from her face.

Vanessa's fingers flew across the fabric, and soon, a pair of lifelike ducks emerged on the embroidery hoop—executed in flawless double-sided stitch.

"Pass," the cheongsam-clad woman declared with approval.

Vanessa turned and hugged Lucy. "All thanks to your guidance last night."

Lily dug her nails into her palms. Lucy again! Always ruining her plans!

Live comments exploded:
[Queen Vanessa slays!]
[Lucy's full of surprises!]
[This duo has my heart!]

By afternoon, the group relocated to the Opera Pavilion. William Jones mesmerized everyone with a rendition of "The Drunken Concubine," effortlessly clearing his challenge.

As evening fell, the cast gathered at the inn for casual conversation—until an uninvited guest stormed in.

Dressed in designer labels, the woman lifted her chin and fixed Ethan Smith with an intense stare. "Ethan, I'm leaving tomorrow."

Ethan's expression turned icy. "Ms. Chase, mind your manners."

Lucy rose to leave but was stopped.

"In such a hurry, Ms. White?" Jessica Chase sneered. "Afraid I'll expose you?"

The courtyard fell silent. Everyone held their breath, waiting to see how this confrontation would unfold.
###Chapter 196: Becoming a Target

Lucy White almost laughed in disbelief.

Was this woman out of her mind? Instead of confronting the man who rejected her, she chose to take it out on another woman? What kind of logic was that?

Turning around, Lucy crossed her arms, her red lips curling into a smirk. "Me, guilty? You're the one who should be ashamed."

She hadn’t even settled the score with this woman over the last online scandal.

If Ethan Smith hadn’t stepped in to uncover the truth and applied pressure behind the scenes, who knew what other schemes she might have cooked up?

Ethan’s expression darkened dangerously. "Jessica Chase, it seems my last warning wasn’t harsh enough."

He pulled out his phone, ready to make a call.

Jessica paled instantly. "Ethan, after all these years of waiting for you, is this how you treat me?"

This time, she didn’t dare call him "Ethan" affectionately.

From the moment she first laid eyes on him, she had been obsessed with this strikingly handsome man. Ivy League-educated, a self-made entrepreneur, from a prestigious family—she believed she was the only woman worthy of him.

But before she could even make her move, she heard Ethan had broken his own rules to join a reality show—for some actress.

It felt like a slap in the face.

Ethan was beyond exasperated. "When did I ever ask you to wait? A year ago, when your family proposed an arranged marriage, I refused on the spot."

"Besides, we barely know each other. My attitude toward you is perfectly justified."

This explanation was mostly for Lucy’s benefit—he didn’t want any misunderstandings.

"If you’re sick, go get treatment. Don’t throw a tantrum here."

Jessica staggered as if struck by lightning, unable to believe Ethan would speak to her like this.

"Ethan, have you no regard for our families’ friendship?"

He scoffed. "If it weren’t for that friendship, do you think simply being sent abroad would’ve been the end of it?"

Done with the conversation, he dialed Jason Chase’s number. "Control your sister, or I won’t hold back."

A reply came swiftly from the other end. "Don’t worry. She snuck out—the bodyguards are on their way."

Ethan’s voice was icy. "Send her to Africa. She’ll fit in better there."

Anyone who dared target Lucy would pay the price.

After a brief pause, the response came: "Understood."

Soon, several black-suited bodyguards appeared and forcibly escorted Jessica away.

In the car, Jessica wept dramatically and called her second brother.

"Julian, someone stole my fiancé!"

A playful voice answered. "Who’s bold enough to do that?"

Jessica embellished the story with venomous details.

"I’ll deal with it when I get back," Julian Chase said with a light laugh. "Just some actress—I have plenty of ways to handle her."

Jessica sniffled. "You’re the best, Julian! Ethan told Jason to send me to Africa..."

"Stay there for a while. I’ll find a way to bring you back," Julian reassured her. "As for that Lucy White..."

He smirked. "I’ll seduce her. Once she’s mine, Ethan will naturally return to you."

Jessica giggled through her tears. "Don’t actually fall for her!"

"Relax. No woman is worth my sincerity," Julian said confidently. "I’ll have her wrapped up by next month."

Back at the inn, Lucy remained unaware she had just become someone’s target.

Ethan looked at her apologetically. "I’m sorry. I promise this won’t happen again."
###Chapter 197: Undercurrents

Lucy White never doubted Ethan Smith's loyalty.

She waved her hand dismissively. "Handle it yourself. It's your mess to clean up."

Ethan's expression turned serious. "I barely know her."

Lucy nodded. "That much is obvious."

A sharp glint flashed in her eyes as she added, "But if she provokes me again, I won't hold back."

The venomous glare the woman shot her as security dragged her away told Lucy this wasn’t over.

She hated these petty female rivalries—always blaming each other when the real fault lay with the man.

So what if Jessica Chase had powerful connections? Lucy had her own ways of dealing with troublemakers.

Ethan chuckled. "Do as you please."

"I’ll handle the fallout."

A thought suddenly struck Lucy. "Her name is Jessica Chase. What about her brothers?"

Ethan answered, "The eldest is Jason Chase. The second is Julian Chase."

Lucy nearly laughed out loud. That notorious playboy?

In the original story, Lily Green had been desperately chasing Julian before Lucy's death.

Given the book’s clichéd ending, the womanizer would likely end up in Lily’s harem.

Ethan noticed her distraction. "What’s wrong?"

Lucy snapped back to reality. "Just wondering if Jessica will drag her brothers into this."

Ethan considered it. "Jason is principled. He won’t indulge her whims."

"But Julian is ruthless. Be careful."

Lucy nodded. "Got it."

After chatting a while longer, they retired to their respective rooms.

Meanwhile, in a luxury hotel overseas...

Julian Chase opened the latest email.

Photos of Lucy filled the screen.

He smirked. "No wonder even Ethan fell for her."

Scrolling through the attached dossier, his grin widened.

"Interesting. I accept the challenge."

The next day, the production crew returned to Heritage Mountain.

Their final destination—the Tea Pavilion.

Aside from Ethan and Lucy, none of the other guests knew the first thing about tea ceremonies.

The pair breezed through four challenges, effortlessly unlocking the pavilion’s doors.

After the livestream ended, the director beamed.

"I never expected you’d unlock all the pavilions!"

Ratings had hit another record high.

Robert Lee grinned. "All thanks to Lucy and Ethan."

The others chimed in agreement.

Lucy and Ethan exchanged a knowing smile.

Back home, Lucy caught up on sleep.

She’d just woken when Bruce Wu called.

"Master Lucy, I’ve found three potential mountains."

Lucy brightened. "I’m free tomorrow."

At dawn, Bruce arrived to pick her up.

After inspecting all three sites, they settled on the largest.

Bruce contacted the owner. "He’s hosting a gala this afternoon. We can negotiate there."

Lucy hesitated. "Is that appropriate?"

Bruce smiled. "Perfect chance to introduce you to some connections."

Post-lunch, the trio headed to the event.

Lucy and her mother chose a quiet corner.

Then her gaze sharpened.

Ian Stone stood across the room in a white suit—his demeanor utterly unlike before.

Every instinct in Lucy screamed:

Something’s wrong.
###Chapter 198: The Real Ian Stone

Lucy White leaned against the champagne table in the corner of the gala, her gaze locked on Ian Stone as he entered the room.

Dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit, he moved through the crowd with effortless grace. People approached him for conversation, and he responded with just the right smile.

Half an hour later, Ian finally extricated himself and walked alone toward the terrace.

Lucy set down her glass and followed.

"What a coincidence," she said, standing beside him, twirling her champagne flute between her fingers.

Ian visibly startled before flashing a delighted smile. "You're here too?"

Lucy studied him discreetly. The last time they'd parted, she had specifically drawn a protective talisman for him. Yet now, there was no trace of its energy on him.

Stranger still, his features seemed more indistinct than before.

Most alarming of all—the curse within him had vanished.

"The company just relocated back home. Too many social obligations," Ian suddenly leaned in, his breath carrying the rich scent of red wine. "Lucy, are you single now?"

That familiar tone instantly reminded her of the man from her past life who had called himself "Stone Ji."

"And if I am?" She took half a step back.

"Be my girlfriend," he said with a roguish smirk, though his eyes remained cold.

So it was him.

Lucy let out a cold laugh. "Not interested."

As she turned away, she could feel the heat of his gaze burning into her back.

Returning to her seat, she immediately texted Ian: Where are you?

He replied quickly: Out. Why?

Lucy glanced at the terrace—the "Ian" there was deep in conversation, his phone untouched.

She swiftly arranged to meet at their usual café at eight that evening.

Just as she set her phone down, Bruce Wu approached with three men in tow.

"This is Master Lucy," he introduced respectfully.

The middle-aged man on the left extended his hand. "I've heard so much about you. I'm Mr. Zachary. I hear you have an interest in South Mountain?"

Lucy studied his face for a moment before saying bluntly, "You've been having a streak of bad luck lately, haven't you?"

Mr. Zachary's smile froze.

"Perhaps we should speak privately?" he murmured.

Lucy nodded and turned to her mother. "Mom, wait here for me."

Grace White smiled gently. "Of course."

That smile left the men momentarily stunned. No one would have guessed this elegant woman, who looked barely thirty, was Lucy's mother.

On the terrace, Mr. Zachary finally dropped his façade.

"Master Lucy, what you said earlier—"

"The son you've raised for twenty years isn't biologically yours," Lucy stated plainly. "Your wife refuses a divorce, your family has suffered one misfortune after another, and your company projects keep failing."

Mr. Zachary paled.

These were things he had never told a soul.
###Chapter 199: The Truth Revealed

All traces of doubt vanished from Mr. Zachary's face.

"Master Lucy, since you can discern my predicament, I must ask—are these recent misfortunes mere accidents, or is someone behind them?"

He had previously consulted a feng shui master, but no issues were found in his home or company. That practitioner only understood basic principles and couldn’t detect deeper disturbances. After hearing about the Wu family’s case, he decided to seek Lucy’s help.

He strongly suspected foul play—before the scandal broke, everything had been smooth sailing. But ever since that incident, his home and business had been plagued with disasters. He’d even had the woman and her illegitimate child followed, but found nothing.

Lucy gave a slight nod. "You’re surrounded by misfortune and tainted by something unclean. This is undoubtedly man-made."

Mr. Zachary’s expression darkened. "Something unclean?"

Lucy explained, "The problem lies in an item you wear daily."

Relief washed over him—he’d nearly been frightened out of his wits. "Which item?"

Lucy pointed to his wristwatch. "This one."

Mr. Zachary froze. What could be wrong with a watch? But his trust in Lucy was absolute, so he immediately removed it and handed it to her.

"Please enlighten me, Master."

Lucy took the watch, pried open the back with a small dagger, and extracted a dark red slip of paper.

"Your birth hex is written here. This has been cultivated in a place of extreme yin energy for a long time. Wearing it constantly affects your health and fortune."

Trembling, Mr. Zachary took the slip—his birth details were indeed inscribed there.

Master Lucy truly lived up to her reputation!

"What would have happened if I kept wearing it?"

Lucy’s expression turned grave. "At best, chronic illness. At worst, a fatal accident. You wouldn’t have lasted six months."

A chill ran down Mr. Zachary’s spine, fury igniting in his eyes. "That bastard planned to kill me all along!"

The watch had been a birthday gift from the illegitimate child last year. He never imagined it was a death warrant. Clearly, the boy had known his true origins and schemed to eliminate him.

"Master, is there anything else wrong with me?"

He removed a jade pendant from his neck. "This was from that woman."

Lucy sighed. "I was about to mention it. This jade is also tainted."

"It’s a funerary object. Not only does it harm you, but it will also bring misfortune to your family."

Mr. Zachary’s fists clenched, veins bulging as he shook with rage.

"That venomous witch! How heartless!"

Then, realization struck, and his face turned even grimmer.

A year ago, his wife had begun meeting a man frequently. Though he had no concrete proof, that man was likely the bastard’s real father.

Those two snakes weren’t just after his life—they wanted his fortune too!

"Master, now that I’ve removed these, will the disasters stop?"

Lucy nodded. "For now, yes."

"But your vitality has been severely drained. You’ll need to wear a talisman I prepare to restore your energy."

Mr. Zachary pressed urgently, "Please make one for me today!"

All he wanted now was to live long enough to see them pay.

"Very well."

Lucy added, "The frequent accidents at your company’s new mall suggest sabotage. I’ll inspect it tomorrow."

Mr. Zachary was overcome with gratitude. "Thank you, Master!"

"Shall I pay you now?" he asked eagerly.

Lucy arched a brow. "One million for the feng shui consultation, another hundred thousand for the talisman. Mr. Wu must have told you?"

Mr. Zachary nodded repeatedly. "Yes, yes."

Soon, his secretary completed the transfer.

Lucy drew the talisman on the spot and confiscated the cursed jade and watch.

After arranging the mall inspection for the next day, they returned to the main hall.

Lucy headed toward her mother’s seat—but the moment she saw the two people standing before her, her expression turned icy.
###Chapter 200: Why Humiliate Yourself?

Grace White tapped her crystal glass with manicured fingertips, watching the orange juice swirl gently. She lifted her gaze, calmly surveying the pair before her—her former fiancé and stepsister.

Frederick Von's breathing hitched. After twenty years, she was more radiant than he remembered. The stubborn girl had blossomed into a woman of effortless elegance, though those clear eyes still made his heart stutter.

"Yes?" Grace's crimson lips parted, her voice glacial.

Giselle Gould spoke first. "Grace, where have you been all these years? Father's been worried sick."

"Worried?" Grace chuckled mirthlessly. "Worried I didn't die properly, you mean?"

Nearby guests turned at the barbed remark.

Giselle's face tightened. "How could you say that? We're family."

"Family?" Grace swirled her drink. "Was that what you were thinking when you climbed into my fiancé's bed?"

Frederick interjected hastily, "Grace, that was all a misunderstanding—"

"Misunderstanding?" Her eyebrow arched. "Shall I refresh your memory about how I caught you in flagrante?"

The ballroom fell silent.

Giselle's nails dug into her palms. She loathed Grace's imperious demeanor.

"Let bygones be bygones," Frederick said with affected tenderness. "Perhaps we could meet privately?"

Grace scoffed. "To discuss what? Your inability to keep it in your pants?"

She rose, stilettoes clicking sharply against marble.

"Twenty years, Frederick, and you're still revolting."

His face darkened at the public humiliation.

Giselle's eyes welled with crocodile tears. "Grace, Father truly misses you—"

"Misses me?" Grace's smile turned arctic. "Or misses my kidneys? I heard the old man's in renal failure."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Giselle trembled—how did she know?

"Leave," Grace turned away. "You're embarrassing yourselves."

"Wait!" Giselle snapped, mask slipping. "You think this is twenty years ago? Without the Gould name, you're nothing in the capital!"

Grace glanced back, lips curling. "Is that so?"

A cool feminine voice cut through the tension. "Mother, you're late. Uncle David's been waiting."

Lucy White linked arms with Grace, eyeing the pair. "And these people are...?"

"Nobody important." Grace patted her daughter's hand affectionately.

Giselle's pupils constricted. Uncle David? Not...that Wilson family?

Frederick blanched, finally noticing the jade bracelet on Grace's wrist—the same one that broke auction records this year.

"Let's go." Lucy cast them a dismissive look. "Some people just enjoy self-inflicted humiliation."

Arm in arm, mother and daughter departed, leaving a seething Giselle and shell-shocked Frederick in their wake.

The ballroom buzzed with whispers.

Giselle glared daggers at Grace's retreating figure, venom in her gaze.

Why did this bitch have to come back?
###Chapter 201: So It's You

The probing gazes from the surrounding crowd made Frederick Von and his wife feel their faces burn with humiliation.

The longer this standoff continued, the more disgraceful it became.

Lucy White's sudden appearance had caught them completely off guard.

Frederick vividly remembered the girl's sharp confrontation during the jade auction.

Unable to hold back, he demanded, "What's your relationship with Grace?"

Lucy linked arms with her mother. "I'm her daughter."

Frederick's expression darkened instantly.

Grace had not only remarried but also had a grown daughter.

It suddenly dawned on him—the girl must have recognized them during the auction.

The fact that his own daughter had provoked the conflict was conveniently ignored.

Lucy frowned in disgust. "Are you leaving or not?"

"If not, I don't mind digging up what happened twenty years ago and letting everyone judge for themselves."

Frederick realized then that Grace's daughter was no pushover.

He gave Grace a long, meaningful look. "Grace, our families have been close for generations..."

Before he could finish, Giselle's eyes flashed with malice.

She forced a smile. "Father has missed you all these years."

Grace cut her off coldly. "My affairs are none of your concern."

Bruce Patel interjected smoothly, "Mr. Von, the gala is about to begin."

Zachary Stone chimed in, "Please, the two of you should go."

Frederick's face twisted with displeasure, but he had no choice but to leave.

As he turned away, he cast one last glance at Grace.

The woman he had once loved now carried an even more captivating grace.

Giselle clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

Once they were gone, Lucy asked softly, "Mom, are you okay?"

Grace patted her daughter's hand. "It was bound to happen sooner or later."

A steely glint flickered in her eyes. "If they dare come again, they’ll regret it."

Lucy leaned against her shoulder. "I'll always stand by you."

Grace gently tucked a loose strand of Lucy's hair behind her ear. "I know."

After the gala officially began, Lucy left early with her mother.

At eight that evening, Lucy drove alone to a secluded café she frequented.

A text from Ian Stone lit up her phone: [Here. Booth 308.]

Pushing open the door to the private booth, she found Ian reviewing documents.

He closed the folder when she entered. "Your coffee just arrived. Still hot."

Lucy took a sip. "My usual."

Ian smiled. "You asked to meet. Something on your mind?"

Lucy met his gaze directly. "I saw you at the gala today."

"You said you were going to pursue me." Her tone was eerily calm.

Ian's smile froze.

After a beat, he exhaled and chuckled. "I should’ve known I couldn’t fool you."

"So," Lucy cut straight to the point, "you're twins?"

A long silence followed before Ian finally answered, "Yes."

"Our father was the heir to a European warlock family."

"According to tradition, one twin had to be... eliminated."

His voice turned icy. "Ian was the elder brother. More talented."

"Our mother smuggled me back to the country, thinking we’d escaped."

Ian's lips curled into a bitter smirk. "But..."

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 202: The Doppelgänger's Secret

Lucy White stirred her coffee in silence as Ian Stone's deep voice flowed beside her.

"My mother passed when I was seventeen," Ian tapped the table lightly with his slender fingers. "Stage four stomach cancer. Three months from diagnosis to the end."

Lucy's heart clenched. The ripples in her coffee mirrored her furrowed brow.

"The day after the funeral, a man claiming to be my father appeared." A sardonic smile curled Ian's lips. "He told me I had an identical twin brother."

Sunlight through the window suddenly turned harsh. Lucy squinted, watching gold edges frame Ian's profile.

"So you became his shadow?" she murmured.

Ian nodded. "Same height, face, even vocal timbre. The perfect doppelgänger."

She noticed his knuckles whitening around the word "doppelgänger."

"How much did they make you learn?"

"Enough to pass as a multinational CEO." Ian loosened his tie. "Three languages, close-quarters combat, and..." He paused. "Certain unspeakable arts."

Lucy's spoon clinked against her cup. Now she understood the dissonance she'd sensed in him.

"The curse you carry—"

"Family specialty." His laugh was ice. "Insurance against disobedient stand-ins."

Lucy leaned forward abruptly. "Our meeting at Heritage Mountain?"

"Family assignment." Ian met her gaze squarely. "They ordered me to approach you."

"Why me?" Her nails scraped the cup's rim unconsciously.

"Only to investigate your father's whereabouts."

Lucy stiffened. Her father had been missing three years—connected to a European mage family?

"What about Simon's performance today?" She recalled the day's theatrics.

"He enjoys defying the family." Disgust flickered in Ian's eyes. "Though..."

"Though?"

"His interest in Lily Green is genuine." An enigmatic smile appeared. "What blood mage wouldn't covet an aura like hers?"

Lucy nearly choked on her coffee. So the epic romance from the original storyline was a fraud?

"And you now..." She hesitated.

"Waiting for my moment." Ian's voice dropped. "Which is why the curse..."

"I understand." She cut in. "Suppress it temporarily, don't break it."

Tension drained from Ian's shoulders. Sunlight filtered through his lashes, scattering shadows across his face.

"One last question." Lucy studied him. "Does Simon know you've told me the truth?"

Ian smiled. "He'll find out soon enough."

Their reflections gazed at each other in the window glass. For a fleeting moment, Lucy saw the boy who'd once slipped her candies under school desks—except now those sweets hid poison-tipped blades.
###Chapter 203: Hidden Agenda

The afternoon sun blazed overhead as Mr. Zachary personally drove Lucy White to the construction site of his new mall. The moment the car window rolled down, Lucy frowned.

"Something wrong?" Mr. Zachary rubbed his hands nervously. Ever since wearing the talisman she gave him, his chronic insomnia had vanished overnight, deepening his trust in the young mystic.

Lucy tapped the window lightly. "A gathering of miasma, but nothing severe yet."

Yellow caution tape cordoned off the site, where workers huddled in small groups, whispering. Spotting his boss, the project manager rushed over. "Mr. Zachary, this morning someone saw—"

"I know." He cut him off, turning to Lucy. "What do you think?"

She walked slowly around the site, pausing abruptly before a stack of lumber. Bending down, she picked up a wood chip and rolled it between her fingers. "Yin-infused timber."

"What?" Mr. Zachary paled.

"These logs grew in a place of extreme darkness and were deliberately transported here." She tossed the chip back. "Another two weeks, and lives would've been lost."

The developer immediately summoned his secretary. Within ten minutes, the man returned sweating. "The supplier was contacted by... your brother-in-law."

"Perfect." Mr. Zachary's laugh was icy. "Couldn't wait for me to die, could they?"

Lucy retrieved cinnabar from her bag and drew sigils around the lumber pile. "Burn it all—every last piece." She then instructed adjustments to key construction points.

As they left, Mr. Zachary handed her a contract. "The mountain property we agreed on—"

Lucy scanned the deed's "free transfer" clause and shook her head. "Market price."

"Absolutely not!" he protested. "You saved my life!"

"Then take this instead." She suddenly smiled. "When the mountain yields its treasures, you'll get the first taste."

He was still objecting when his phone rang. After the call, his expression darkened. "My wife—no, that woman took my son to make trouble at the old estate."

"Need to handle it?" Lucy asked.

"No." He gritted his teeth. "Let them keep that cursed house!"

During the return trip, Lucy called Ethan Smith. He answered on the third ring, background voices faintly calling "Director Smith."

"Busy?" she asked.

A chair scraped on his end. "Just finished a meeting. What's up?"

"Dinner tonight with you and Evan. Also, I'm collecting that jade."

Ethan's voice brightened noticeably. "Six o'clock, usual place?"

Hanging up, Lucy gazed absently at the passing scenery. In the rearview mirror, a black sedan trailed at a steady pace, its driver's face obscured by a baseball cap.

At her apartment building, Ethan was already waiting. He naturally took her bag as she emerged. "Ian Stone has a twin brother."

Lucy's fingers paused on the seatbelt. "Ian Stone?"

"You knew?" He started the engine. "Their background's complicated."

"Figured." She watched the black car suddenly accelerate past them. "Such elaborate efforts to get close to me means they want something big."

Ethan followed her gaze, eyes turning glacial. "From today on, I drive you."

She didn't refuse. Sunset patterns flickered between them through the windows. Neither noticed the faint glow from the jade bracelet around her wrist.
###Chapter 204: No More Pretenses

In the private dining room of an exclusive restaurant, Evan York and Hunter Wilde had been waiting for some time.

"Ethan, Lucy, you're finally here!" Hunter rose with a cheerful grin. "Hope you don't mind this uninvited guest?"

After being cooped up at home recovering from his injuries, he'd jumped at the chance to join when Evan mentioned dinner plans.

Ethan shook his head in mock exasperation. "Now that you're here, it's not like we can kick you out."

Lucy offered a warm smile. "You're welcome to join us."

The meal passed with lively conversation and clinking glasses.

As they prepared to leave, Hunter suddenly asked, "When are you coming to my company to pick out some pieces? I've been waiting forever."

Their original appointment had been postponed due to his hospitalization, and it had been weighing on his mind.

Lucy considered briefly. "How about tomorrow?"

She had live performances to prepare for the day after, followed immediately by filming.

"It's settled then!" Hunter's eyes lit up.

He'd been eager to repay Lucy for saving his life and hoped she'd select plenty of fine pieces.

After dinner, the group headed to Evan's company.

The raw jade stones Lucy had previously chosen still needed cutting. Evan had arranged for his master stonecutter to work overtime.

As each stone was split open, every single one revealed premium jade—several of exceptional quality.

Evan was speechless with shock. In all his years in the business, he'd never seen such precise judgment.

"Lucy's talent for spotting jade..." he murmured to Ethan in awe.

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Naturally."

"Keep this quiet," he cautioned. "She dislikes drawing attention."

If word got out, it could invite unnecessary trouble.

Evan nodded solemnly. "Understood."

"We must bring Lucy to the next jade auction," he suggested.

It would be a waste not to utilize such remarkable skill.

Ethan agreed with a smile. "Absolutely."

Lucy only took a few of the finest pieces, entrusting the rest to Evan for delivery to the mountain she'd leased. Some mid-to-high grade jade was given to Ethan to craft into jewelry.

The next morning, Lucy and her brother accompanied their mother on a shopping trip.

Upon returning, they found three people waiting at their doorstep: an elderly man leaning on a cane, a well-maintained woman, and the all-too-familiar Giselle Gould.

Grace White's brow furrowed slightly.

Winston Gould stared at his daughter, momentarily seeing his late wife in her features. The resemblance went beyond mere appearance now—even her demeanor was identical.

A pang of nostalgia struck him.

Remarrying had been a reluctant decision back then, his company demanding too much time to handle his rebellious daughter. His new wife had doted on the girl, yet Grace remained cold.

Gradually, his heart had hardened.

Twenty years had passed since they'd last seen each other.

"Is this how you greet your father?" Winston demanded sternly.

Grace scoffed. "I wouldn't dare claim such relations—who knows how I might end up dead."

"You!" Winston trembled with rage. "Have you forgotten your family name?"

"I changed it to White long ago," Grace replied icily.

"Outrageous!" Winston bellowed. "Who gave you permission?"

Beatrice Gould quickly soothed him with gentle words. "Grace, your father has missed you all these years—"

"Spare me the act," Grace cut her off sharply. "We all know exactly what this is about."

She met her stepmother's gaze directly. "Relax, I've no interest in the Gould fortune. Save your performance."

A flicker of triumph flashed in Beatrice's eyes, though she maintained a wounded expression. "How could you think so poorly of me—"

"Enough!" Grace's face twisted in disgust. "Your fake concern makes me sick."

That very same act had driven the wedge between father and daughter years ago. Now, she wanted nothing to do with their so-called family.

Beatrice's face stiffened—being called out so bluntly nearly shattered her carefully constructed facade.
###Chapter 205: It's Time for the Goulds to Fall

Giselle Gould hid a smirk as Grace White's defiant attitude played right into her hands.

With practiced theatrics, she dabbed at her eyes. "Grace, my mother hasn't slept properly for years searching for you. How could you break her heart like this?"

"She's still your elder," Giselle added pointedly.

Grace let out a cold laugh, done entertaining their charade.

Playing the victim was easy—but she was sick to death of this mother-daughter act. That so-called father of hers had never shown her an ounce of warmth. The memories of his blatant favoritism still turned her stomach.

"Worthless," Grace spat, eyes flashing. "The sight of you two makes me sick."

"Get out."

Though Beatrice and Giselle had achieved their goal, the public humiliation left them seething.

Winston Gould trembled with rage. "Ungrateful wretch! Who taught you to speak to your elders this way?"

"I had a mother but no father to raise me," Grace shot back. "My mother's fortune will last me lifetimes."

"After she died, I endured abuse from nannies and torment from these two. And you dare lecture me about respect?"

She enunciated every word: "Don't you dare play the father card. You. Don't. Deserve. It."

The venom in her glare stunned Winston.

In his mind, he'd never mistreated her—she'd had the finest clothes, the best education. He'd even believed his wife treated Grace kindly.

"You—!" He choked on his fury.

Grace cut him off. "I made myself clear when I publicly disowned you years ago."

"The sight of you disgusts me. Never come near me again."

Years of pent-up rage finally unleashed.

"Let's go."

She took Lucy and Noah's hands, striding toward the exit without a backward glance.

Winston bellowed after her, "Grace Gould! You're throwing away the Gould legacy?"

Grace didn't pause. "The Gould Group? It's worth less than dirt to me."

"Remember this—my name is Grace White now."

The door slammed shut with finality.

Outside, Winston's enraged shouts echoed: "That wretched girl! Absolute disgrace!"

Beatrice feigned concern. "Darling, don't upset yourself. She's just confused..."

"Perhaps we should return another—"

Her placating tone only fueled his fury.

"From today onward, I have no daughter!"

As their footsteps faded, Grace exhaled deeply.

Lucy's eyes sparkled. "Mom, you were amazing!"

Noah nodded vigorously. "Yeah! What right does that old man have to criticize you?"

Warmth flooded Grace's heart at her children's support.

"Mom," Lucy asked suddenly, "where are the Gould family graves?"

If they cared so much about their legacy...

It was time to erase the Goulds from existence.
###Chapter 206: The Wheel Turns

Grace White set down her teacup, her sharp gaze fixed on her daughter. "Are you planning to interfere with the Gould family's ancestral graves?"

Lucy White smirked, her fingers lightly tapping the table. "You guessed right, Mom." Her voice was icy. "Since Winston Gould cares so much about his company, I'll make sure he watches it crumble with his own eyes."

The methods of a metaphysics practitioner were far more terrifying than ordinary people could imagine. Ruining a family's fortune? A mere flick of the wrist.

As for karma? Lucy could handle it.

Grace pondered for a moment. "Just don't take any lives." It wasn't out of mercy—she simply didn’t want blood on her daughter’s hands.

Soon, Grace revealed the exact location of the Gould family’s ancestral burial site. She, too, was eager to see the expressions on that pretentious mother-daughter pair’s faces when they lost everything.

"Don’t worry. They’re not worth staining my hands for." Lucy’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. "I want Winston to witness how his beloved woman betrays him."

Mother and daughter exchanged knowing smiles.

Despite the morning’s unpleasant scene, lunch was a warm and cheerful affair. The three of them enjoyed a comforting home-cooked meal together.

Afterward, Lucy grabbed her bag and headed out.

Ethan Smith was already waiting downstairs. The moment she got into the car, he sensed her mood. "Who upset you?"

Lucy didn’t hide it, recounting the morning’s events in detail.

"That pair won’t let this go," she muttered irritably. "I can’t stand hypocrites."

A cold glint passed through Ethan’s eyes. "Want me to handle it?"

With the Smith family’s influence, bankrupting the Gould Group would be effortless.

Lucy’s heart warmed. This man always stood by her side without question.

"No need." She shook her head. "I’m targeting their ancestral graves. If I need help, I’ll ask."

Ethan affectionately ruffled her hair. "Do whatever makes you happy."

As long as she was pleased, he’d let her play however she wanted.

He’d always be there to clean up the mess.

They drove to Hunter Wilde’s antique company.

Hunter had instructed his secretary to greet them at the entrance, ushering them eagerly into the exhibition hall.

"Take whatever catches your eye," Hunter declared grandly.

Lucy arched a brow. "Generous today, Hunter?"

Hunter thumped his chest. "Money’s no object!"

Ethan smirked. "Don’t worry. We won’t hold back."

Hunter shot him a glare. This friend of his was becoming more and more of a traitor—completely shameless!

The exhibition hall was filled with treasures. Lucy examined each piece carefully until her gaze landed on a set of ancient ritual blade coins.

A faint miasma clung to their surfaces—exactly what she needed.

"I’ll take these," she said, pointing.

Hunter’s eyes lit up. "Excellent choice! These are our prized collection." He immediately ordered his secretary to pack them, relieved he hadn’t sold them earlier.

After browsing further, Lucy selected an incense burner and an antique inkstone—the latter for Inklet.

The little creature, catching the scent of ink, wriggled out of her bag and stared longingly at the inkstone.

"Is this thing sentient?" Hunter gaped.

Lucy stroked Inklet’s head fondly. "He’s very clever."

Inklet smugly lifted his chin at Hunter before darting into Ethan’s arms.

Hunter: "..."

Even a weasel knew how to suck up to the right person now?
###Chapter 207: The Mysterious Investor

Morning sunlight streamed through the car window, casting a golden glow on Lucy White's delicate profile.

"Lucy, we're here," her assistant whispered.

Lucy nodded and stepped out of the car, where the production crew immediately greeted her.

"Ms. White, all the other guests have arrived."

As soon as she entered the rehearsal room, the director walked in.

"Everyone, there's been a change in the rules for this live performance," the director announced, scanning the group. "Each guest will perform an opening act independently."

The announcement caused an instant stir.

Robert Lee scratched his head. "So we have to compose and choreograph everything ourselves?"

"Exactly," the director confirmed. "The trainees will compete in teams, while your main role is to guide them."

The livestream cameras switched on, displaying six split screens simultaneously.

[Ahhh, the livestream is finally starting!]
[The guest lineup is so eye-catching!]
[Can't wait to see Lucy's new performance!]

William Jones was the first to step forward. "I can handle the music composition."

Michael Johnson's gaze lingered on Lucy. "She excels at writing lyrics and composing. I can take care of the choreography."

Lucy raised an eyebrow. He remembered her skills well.

"Then Mr. Jones and I will handle the music," she agreed readily.

Ethan Smith suddenly spoke up. "Count me in."

Lily Green quickly interjected, "I've studied dance. I can assist Mr. Johnson."

Michael's expression darkened slightly, but he couldn't refuse outright.

The creative process went surprisingly smoothly.

Lucy's lyrics were written swiftly and skillfully, earning frequent praise even from William.

"This rhyme scheme is brilliant," he remarked, pointing at the draft.

Ethan smiled. "Ms. White's talent never fails to impress."

In contrast, the dance team's atmosphere grew tense.

"Mr. Johnson, shouldn't this move be like this?" Lily leaned in again.

Michael took half a step back. "Stick to my choreography."

[Can Lily stop clinging to Michael?]
[He looks like he's about to snap.]

Five days of rehearsals passed in a flash.

On the night of the live performance, viewership hit a record high.

Lucy, dressed in red, played a haunting melody on the guzheng. Before the last note faded, her clear vocals filled the air.

When the operatic falsetto kicked in, the live comments exploded.

[That vocal control is insane!]
[My mom asked why I'm watching my phone on my knees.]

When the final lineup was announced, everyone was stunned.

"Seventh place—Benjamin Harris!"

The once-lowest-ranked trainee was overcome with emotion. "Thank you, Ms. White... Without her, I wouldn't be here today."

Noah Adams and Ryan Clark also made the cut, and the three hugged each other in tears.

[So inspiring.]
[Having the right mentor makes all the difference.]

At the celebration party, the director quietly approached Lucy.

"Interested in Season 2? We can negotiate your fee."

Lucy shook her head. "I'll be focusing on filming next."

Unnoticed by her, Ethan's lips curved slightly in the corner.

Three days later, at the xianxia drama Celestial Ascension set:

"Ms. White, Director Jude wants to see you," a staff member called out.

Inside the meeting room, beside Director Jude sat an unfamiliar man.

"Let me introduce our new investor, Mr. Chase."

The man stood, his gaze behind gold-rimmed glasses unreadable.

"Ms. White, I've heard so much about you."

Lucy's pulse quickened.

What exactly did this Mr. Chase want?
###Chapter 208: She Must Intervene

Julian Chase's gaze lingered on Lucy White, a flicker of admiration flashing in his eyes.

She was far more captivating in person than in photographs.

He rose slightly and gave a polite nod. "Miss White."

Lucy returned the gesture. "Mr. Chase."

Turning to Director Jude, she said, "I'll go get ready for makeup now."

Director Jude chuckled. "We're shooting promotional stills today, so expect multiple outfit changes."

"No problem." Lucy smiled faintly before walking away.

Julian watched her retreating figure, his lips curling into an intrigued smirk.

Inside the makeup room, Lucy dialed Hugo Shaw's number.

"Master White?" Hugo's voice came through the line.

"Mr. Shaw, a major new investor showed up on set today. Were you aware?"

Hugo's tone turned serious. "Jason Chase suddenly injected capital. He's now the primary investor."

"That man has a complicated background and a notorious reputation as a playboy. Be careful."

He hesitated before adding, "I suspect... he might be targeting you."

Lucy's eyes glinted. "Understood."

Hanging up, she stepped out of the makeup room.

Lily Green was distributing drinks with her assistant in tow.

Watching Lily approach Julian with a coy smile and a beverage, Lucy scoffed.

Another target acquired?

To her surprise, Julian remained indifferent, refusing even to accept the drink.

Lucy pondered this.

It seemed the protagonist's halo had dimmed considerably.

Then she remembered the original plot.

Today was the day Julian would be ambushed.

In the story, Lily would "coincidentally" rescue him.

She couldn't let that happen!

During the promotional shoot, Lucy's performance dazzled everyone.

Lily glared at the proofs, her face darkening.

Storming over to the photographer, she snapped, "Did you deliberately make me look bad?"

The photographer didn't mince words. "Miss White simply outshines you. Should I photoshop you into a goddess?"

Lily trembled with rage.

Director Jude arrived and immediately berated her.

"One more outburst and you're replaced!" he warned sharply.

Lily bit her lip, tears streaming down her cheeks.

But inwardly, she vowed: Just wait until I'm famous. You'll be the first one I blacklist!

Seeing Julian head toward the restroom, she quickly wiped her tears and followed.
###Chapter 209: Five Million for This Talisman – Take It or Leave It

Julian Chase had just stepped out of the restroom when a woman with tear-streaked makeup crashed into him.

"Mr. Chase..." Lily Green sniffled, lifting her head. Her carefully drawn eyeliner had smudged into raccoon circles, and her false lashes dangled precariously from her eyelids.

Julian instinctively took half a step back, his brow furrowing slightly.

This woman was a mess.

"Can I help you?" he asked coolly, drying his hands with a paper towel.

Seeing his response, Lily immediately straightened, summoning her most pitiful expression. "I'm so embarrassed, I just—"

"I suggest you fix your makeup first," Julian cut her off, tossing the towel into the trash. "This is hardly a pleasant sight."

Without another glance, he walked away.

Lily froze, only snapping out of it moments later when she rushed to the mirror—

"Ah!" Her shriek echoed through the restroom.

She stomped her foot in frustration. Her carefully planned "chance encounter" had been completely ruined.

On the other side of the set, Lucy White was engrossed in her script.

"Miss White takes her work very seriously," Julian remarked, appearing beside her with an amused smile.

Lucy closed the script and looked up. "Something you need, Mr. Chase?"

This man's sudden approach was undoubtedly about Jessica Chase.

She remained guarded.

"Just passing by to say hello." Julian sat beside her, his gaze intense. "You're even more striking in person than on screen."

Lucy studied his face for a few seconds.

"What? Captivated by me?" Julian smirked.

"Mr. Chase," Lucy said bluntly, "your aura is dark. You'll face a blood calamity tonight."

Julian's smile faltered. "...Excuse me?"

"Since you're the investor, I'll give you a protective talisman." Lucy pulled out a yellow charm from her bag. "But it's not free."

Julian nearly laughed.

Was she really playing the mystic to get his attention?

"How much?" he asked, intrigued.

"Five million."

"..." Julian's expression froze. "Are you joking?"

"Fine, forget it." Lucy moved to take it back.

"Wait!" Julian snatched the talisman, barely suppressing his amusement. "I'll take it."

He was curious to see what game she was playing.

Lucy recited her bank details. "Keep it on you at all times."

"Absolutely." Julian tucked it into his shirt pocket, lowering his voice deliberately. "Miss White cares about me that much?"

Lucy ignored him and stood to return to filming.

Julian watched her walk away, his lips curving into a smirk.

This game was getting more interesting by the minute.
###Chapter 210: Sanctimonious in Her Element

The set lights blazed to life.

Lucy White glided onto the scene in a pale yellow chiffon gown, the pearls in her hair swaying with each graceful step. As she pushed open the courtyard gate, sunlight spilled across her porcelain face, her almond eyes crinkling into crescents. "Senior Brother!"

That honeyed voice made Director Jude Miller jerk upright behind the monitor.

"Cut!" The assistant director slapped his thigh in excitement. "Those eyes—perfection!"

Ryan Choi stood frozen. He'd never seen Lucy like this—radiant, her expressive eyes sparkling like a cherished junior disciple straight out of a martial arts novel.

Three scenes flowed seamlessly.

"Ms. White's acting is phenomenal," a crew member murmured. "Even Mr. Choi got swept up in her performance."

Lily Green lurked in the shadows, her nails digging into her palms. She watched as staff flocked around Lucy with water and towels, even the director personally giving notes. Her chest tightened like she'd swallowed cotton.

"Your turn," a production assistant reminded her.

Lily took a deep breath and stepped into frame. This was her specialty—a tearful reunion between the heroine and her long-lost father. The tears came on cue. She shot the director a confident look.

"Again!" Director Jude frowned. "The tear falls after the line, not like a leaky faucet!"

By the fifth take, Ryan's wig was soaked with sweat. His gaze drifted to the rest area—Lucy was handing out chilled drinks to extras, earning a beaming grin from a young actress.

"Action!"

Lily suddenly had an epiphany. She softened her posture, clutching Ryan's sleeve with glistening eyes. "Senior Brother, you're all I have now..." Her gaze flickered toward the camera.

"Cut!" Jude hurled his script. "You're playing a warrior, not a mistress!"

The assistant director leaned in to whisper, "But this version has more viral potential..."

On the monitor, Lily "accidentally" stumbled into Ryan's arms, her collar slipping just enough to reveal a sliver of skin.

"Fine. Keep it." Jude massaged his temples. "Melodrama thrives on controversy anyway."

Wrapping past midnight, Lily hurled her phone at the sight of the trending hashtag: #LucyPeriodDramaMagic. She didn't realize the cameras had captured every sanctimonious move.

Meanwhile, at an upscale club:

"Julian Chase chasing someone?" His friend twirled a champagne flute, grinning. "Call her already!"

Julian traced the stolen set photo on his phone—Lucy in yellow gauze, bandaging a crew member's hand, her profile gilded by sunset.

"Patience." He drained his glass. "The real show's just beginning."

The chandelier cast shifting shadows across his unreadable gaze.
###Chapter 211: Did That Talisman Actually Save Him?

"Come on, Julian, just make the call!" The private lounge echoed with rowdy encouragement from the group of wealthy young men.

Julian Chase rubbed his temples, the noise giving him a headache. Seizing the opportunity to test Lucy White's sincerity, he dialed the number he'd obtained from a production assistant.

The line rang endlessly before a sleep-laden female voice answered with evident irritation. "Who is this?"

Clearing his throat, Julian adopted a deliberately smooth tone. "Miss White, it's Julian Chase."

"What do you want?" Her voice sharpened instantly, any trace of drowsiness gone.

"Some friends and I are at Nightfall. Care to join us?"

A soft, derisive laugh traveled through the receiver. "Not interested. I'm going back to sleep."

Julian checked his watch. "It's barely past eleven. The night's just starting."

"Early to bed, early to rise." Her tone turned icy. "If that's all—"

"Wait!" He cut in hastily. "As a personal favor?"

Another scoff. "You should be more concerned about surviving tonight, Mr. Chase."

His expression stiffened. Was she still playing this charade?

"That's exactly why I wanted you here," he said, half-joking.

A cold chuckle. "Just keep the talisman on you. Goodbye."

The line went dead with finality.

Silence blanketed the lounge.

"Damn, she's got attitude," someone finally muttered.

"Only a woman like that could catch Julian's eye."

Julian's face cycled through emotions before settling on amused intrigue. "Fascinating."

At 2 a.m., the group stumbled out of the bar, intoxicated and loud.

"Julian, where's your car?" one slurred.

Pulling out his phone, Julian called for his driver. His fingers brushed the talisman in his pocket out of habit.

Thud.

A dull impact numbed his shoulder.

"Look out!" a friend shouted belatedly.

The second bullet was already streaking toward his thigh.

In that split second, Julian felt a searing heat bloom over his chest. The expected agony never came. Trembling, he reached into his shirt pocket—

The talisman had disintegrated into ash.

"This... can't be real..." He stared at the bullet casing in his palm, voice shaking.

"Julian! Are you okay?" The group swarmed him, faces pale with terror.

Asher York, recently returned from overseas, picked up the bullet and went rigid. "This is a cutting-edge sniper round. How could—"

Julian's legs gave out. Only the wall kept him upright. Clutching the ashes, Lucy's detached words echoed in his mind:

"Just keep the talisman on you."
###Chapter 212: The Sweet Taste of Truth

Julian Chase's back was drenched in cold sweat.

Trembling, he pulled out a pinch of black ash from his pocket. "This talisman saved me."

"Are you insane?" His friends exchanged bewildered glances.

"A bulletproof talisman? That's ridiculous!"

In the past, Julian would have scoffed too. But now, the searing heat still lingered on his fingertips.

"The moment the bullet hit me, the talisman burned hot," he said hoarsely. "Then I felt something push me away."

His grave expression made them hesitate.

"Call the experts," someone suggested.

Three phone calls later, the scene was cordoned off. Bodyguards found the sniper's nest on the opposite rooftop—empty.

Two hours in, the forensic and ballistics teams delivered a shocking verdict:

"The bullet did strike its target."

"But it ricocheted as if hitting armor—deflected by some unknown force."

Meanwhile, the Chase family uncovered the truth through their connections—a scorned lover from Julian's past abroad had ordered the hit.

"Lucky she only wanted to cripple you," his father roared over the phone. "Or you'd be dead ten times over!"

The office fell silent.

Asher York swallowed hard. "So... it really was that talisman?"

"The sniper acted on impulse," another muttered. "How could Lucy White have predicted this...?"

Julian stared at his phone, fingers shaking.

At exactly six, the call connected.

"Seems the talisman worked," Lucy's voice carried morning drowsiness. "Five million for your life—worth it?"

Julian's throat went dry. "It was really your talisman..."

"Obviously." The sizzle of frying eggs crackled through. "I told you disaster was coming."

"You didn't say it'd be a gunshot!"

"I'm not omniscient." Her light chuckle grated. "Predicting an assault was impressive enough."

A sudden thought struck him. "Does this talisman... work against car crashes?"

"Even if a truck flings you a hundred meters, you'll survive," she chirped. "Starting to appreciate my talismans now?"

In the background, his friends' overlapping voices chanted, "Sweet truth!"

Julian stared at the ashes in his palm, laughing bitterly. "Sweet. Too sweet."

He lowered his voice. "So... got any more?"
###Chapter 213: Even More Alluring

The talisman Lucy White had drawn for Julian Chase had nearly drained all her spiritual energy. After all, creating a charm capable of deflecting bullets wasn't something one could casually whip up.

"The talismans I sold you before are all gone," she said casually. "Drawing one takes too much effort."

She understood the principle of scarcity marketing perfectly.

Moreover, the Chase family's background was unique. If bullet-deflecting talismans could be mass-produced, it would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention from higher authorities. She wasn't ready for that kind of spotlight yet.

"Really, none left?" Julian couldn't hide his disappointment.

Lucy paused thoughtfully. "No more talismans, but..."

"Next month, I'll have jade amulets available. They won't be as powerful as the talismans, but they can ward off minor misfortunes."

She deliberately hesitated before continuing, "Things like car accidents or falling objects—they can help you avoid those."

"They also repel negative energy and promote health. Wearing one long-term is beneficial."

"Of course, they'll be more expensive. High-quality jade takes time to cultivate in auspicious locations."

Beside them, Ian Evans suddenly lowered his voice. "I know about these! My uncle had one."

"He used to have terrible health, but after wearing a jade pendant gifted by Master Qingyuan from Green Sun Mountain, he became much more energetic."

"Once, he was in a car crash—the driver was seriously injured, but he only got a scratch. Sadly, the jade shattered."

Julian's eyes lit up. "When can I get one?"

"At least a month," Lucy replied leisurely. "Two million per piece."

"The talisman I sold you for five hundred thousand was only because of your investment."

She smirked inwardly—this big fish had finally taken the bait.

Julian immediately declared, "I want to reserve them! As many as you have!"

Lucy feigned reluctance. "Well... I can't guarantee anything."

"Lucy~" Julian suddenly switched to a wheedling tone. "Considering our friendship..."

Lucy cut him off bluntly. "We only met yesterday."

"A day apart feels like years~" Julian grinned shamelessly.

"I'm having breakfast," Lucy said flatly before hanging up.

Listening to the dial tone, Julian shook his head helplessly.

"That temper..." Ian clicked his tongue. "Truly befitting of a master."

Asher York asked curiously, "What's Lucy's background?"

Julian sent a replay link of the variety show to their group chat. "See for yourselves."

The group fast-forwarded through the video.

"Wow, she's stunning!" Ian exclaimed.

Asher scrolled through the comments. "Feng shui, martial arts, academic genius... is there anything she can't do?"

He suddenly looked up. "Julian, introduce me?"

"What? Trying to poach?" Julian narrowed his eyes.

"It's business," Asher said seriously.

Julian finally nodded. "Fine, I'll arrange it when there's a chance."


###Chapter 214: He's Determined to Win Her

The morning sunlight streamed through the car window, casting a golden glow on Lily Green's face.

Her fingers tightened slightly around the steering wheel. Since last night, an inexplicable sense of unease had settled in her chest, as if she'd missed something crucial.

"Damn it, my instincts are never wrong," she muttered irritably, slapping the horn and drawing curious glances from passersby.

She'd driven around all night without spotting a soul. With filming about to start, she reluctantly turned the car around.

Meanwhile, Lucy White had just finished shooting an emotional scene, her eyes still rimmed with red.

"Miss White, someone's asking for you," a crew member whispered.

She looked up to see Julian Chase leaning casually against the rest area, two coffee cups in hand.

"Heard you like caramel macchiatos?" He offered her one with a charming smile.

Lucy accepted it and took a sip—perfect temperature.

"Mr. Chase, here to repay a debt?" She arched a brow.

"A life-saving favor deserves more than coffee." He stepped closer. "How about—"

"Stop." She raised a hand. "A clean transaction doesn’t need romantic theatrics."

Julian blinked, caught off guard. This woman didn’t follow the usual script.

"Free tonight? I’ve got an '82 Lafite—"

"Busy."

"Tomorrow? There’s this private kitchen—"

"Booked through next year." She waved her script.

Julian narrowed his eyes. Women usually threw themselves at him—this was a first.

"Miss White," he lowered his voice, "I hear you’re knowledgeable about firearms?"

Lucy’s fingers stilled. Asher York’s man?

"Tried a few times," she said lightly. "What, Mr. Chase branching into arms dealing?"

"A friend’s very interested in you." His tone turned meaningful. "Perhaps—"

"She’s not interested."

A cold voice cut in. Ethan Smith had appeared behind them, holding a thermos.

"Playing knight in shining armor, Mr. Smith?" Julian smirked.

Ethan unscrewed the lid and handed it to Lucy. "Honey lemon tea. Good for your throat."

Their fingers brushed as she took it. Ethan’s ears turned pink, but he deliberately positioned himself between them.

"Really have plans tonight?" Julian pressed.

"Mm." Lucy nodded. "Script run-through with Mr. Smith."

Julian caught the triumphant glint in Ethan’s eyes and gritted his teeth. Since when did this iceberg learn to intercept?

"Another time, then." He slipped a business card into her script. "Call me anytime."

As he turned, he saw Ethan toss the coffee into the trash and—childishly—stomp on it.

Julian smirked. Fine. He was determined to win her.

In a corner of the set, Lily Green clutched the call sheet, her knuckles white. Now she understood what she’d missed—the man who should’ve been her savior was orbiting Lucy instead.

"System!" she screamed inwardly. "What the hell is going on?"
###Chapter 215: Excellent Taste

Ethan Smith's arrival sent waves through the entire film crew.

"Isn't that the legendary Ethan Smith?" a production assistant gasped behind her hand.

"Oh my god, he actually came to visit the set!"

All eyes followed the tall, elegant figure until he walked straight toward Lucy White.

Makeup artist Cindy tugged her assistant's sleeve excitedly. "See? I told you they were close!"

Lily Green stood in the corner, her nails digging into her palms. She glared at Lucy's direction, eyes burning with barely contained fury.

"Why her..." she muttered through clenched teeth.

Director Jude immediately called "Cut!" and approached with a frown. "Lily, what's that expression? Do it again!"

Snapping out of her trance, Lily forced a smile.

Ethan's assistant began distributing drinks, instantly lightening the atmosphere.

"Thank you, Mr. Smith!"

"Miss White must be really special!"

Director Jude greeted Ethan warmly. "What brings you here today, Mr. Smith?"

Ethan smiled faintly. "Just passing by." His gaze remained fixed on Lucy, who was filming a scene.

Understanding immediately, the director exchanged pleasantries before tactfully excusing himself.

Ethan waited patiently until evening when filming wrapped.

"Hungry?" He took Lucy's bag. "I booked that private congee place."

Lucy looked surprised. "The members-only health cuisine restaurant?"

"Mmm." He opened the car door for her. "Heard it's your favorite."

The car turned into a quiet alley, stopping before an elegant establishment with a traditional sign reading "Gourmet Retreat."

Upon entering, they encountered two elderly gentlemen.

"Ah, young Ethan!" one greeted cheerfully while eyeing Lucy curiously.

Ethan nodded politely and quickly ushered Lucy into a private room.

"Who were those..." Lucy frowned slightly.

"Retired officials." He poured her tea. "Don't mind them."

Meanwhile, outside the room:

"Old Smith, your future daughter-in-law is stunning!" the man exclaimed into his phone.

A loud thud came through the receiver. "I'm on my way!"

An hour later, as they exited, they nearly collided with a cane-wielding gentleman.

"Father?" Ethan blinked in surprise.

The older man feigned astonishment. "What a coincidence!"

Lucy studied the energetic elder, then Ethan, and immediately understood.

"Mr. Smith." She greeted him gracefully.

The elder's eyes lit up. "Excellent! You must visit us soon!"

He winked at his son, but Ethan cut in, "We're leaving, Father."

In the car, Ethan explained, "My father means well, but he's overly enthusiastic in his old age."

Lucy smiled. "He's lovely."

She retrieved an exquisite wooden box from her bag. "Your promised gift."

Inside lay a smooth mutton-fat jade pendant on velvet.

"I carved it myself," she admitted shyly. "It's amateur work..."

Ethan immediately put it on. "I love it."

Under the deepening twilight, they said goodbye at Lucy's doorstep.

"I'll be traveling next week," Ethan mentioned suddenly.

Lucy nodded. "Stay safe."

Meanwhile, across town in an upscale club:

Julian Chase swirled his drink. "That Lucy White, I'm telling you..."

Asher York narrowed his eyes. "You're serious?"

"Absolutely!" Julian slammed his glass down. "I saw it with my own eyes!"

The men exchanged knowing glances.
###Chapter 216: Keeping a Safe Distance

"Interesting." Asher York stroked his chin, eyes gleaming with amusement.

He slung an arm around Julian Chase's neck. "Hey, Jules, how about inviting Lucy to play tactical simulation with us this weekend?"

Julian shoved him away with a look of disgust. "Have you lost your mind?"

"That game's fine for us guys, but would a girl even be interested?"

Their group did frequently organize tactical simulation matches.

They'd brought female companions before, only to find them either exhausted after two steps or becoming walking targets the entire time. Eventually, they stopped inviting women altogether.

Asher lowered his voice mysteriously. "Don't ask questions. I just want to see if she can handle it."

"If she can, then I'll tell you why," he added.

Julian rolled his eyes. "You're being cryptic."

Still, curiosity prickled at him—what was this guy plotting?

The next day, Julian returned to the film set.

The moment Lucy White finished shooting, he approached her with a bright smile.

"Lulu, free tonight?"

She raised an eyebrow. "What now?"

Julian cleared his throat. "Some friends want to meet you."

"They've seen what your talismans can do. They're all begging for protection charms."

Aside from Asher, the others had been pestering him nonstop to arrange this meeting—all for those coveted talismans.

Hearing they were potential clients, Lucy didn't object.

"Fine. Send me the location," she agreed readily.

Julian's eyes lit up. "Want me to pick you up?"

"No." Her refusal was firm.

This guy was notoriously flashy and a well-known playboy. The last thing she needed was to end up in gossip headlines.

Julian didn't push it. Getting her to agree was victory enough.

After discussing with the group, he sent Lucy the address of their usual private dining spot.

Lucy's acting was impeccable—she nailed every scene in one take.

By mid-afternoon, her scenes were done.

After bidding Director Jude farewell, she left the set directly.

Director Jude couldn't be more pleased with Lucy.

With her and Ryan Choi's solid performances, this drama was guaranteed not to flop.

As for the female lead, Lily Green—he'd long given up hope.

It wouldn't be the first time a drama's supporting actress outshone the lead.

Lily watched Lucy and Julian leave together, laughing, and felt her teeth ache with envy.

"How come she gets to leave early?" she muttered.

Director Jude shot her a cold look. "She finishes every scene perfectly in one take. Problem?"

"You, on the other hand—if you keep messing up like yesterday, you're fired."

Lily's eyes reddened, but she dared not retort.

This drama was her last chance at redemption.

"I wasn't feeling well yesterday. It won't happen again," she said meekly.

Yesterday, her nerves had gotten the better of her with her crush on set.

Director Jude waved her off impatiently. "Go get ready."

Lily slunk away to hair and makeup.

In the dressing room, Ryan Choi was getting prepped.

Lily tried striking up a conversation, but Ryan barely acknowledged her before hurrying off, clearly avoiding her.

Fuming, Lily stamped her foot.

Why did men always flock to Lucy?

Especially Julian—he should've been her type.

Now she was down to just Oliver Knight as a backup—far from enough.

If she could snag Julian, she'd dominate the entertainment industry.

As she schemed ways to catch his attention, Julian walked right past her without a glance.

Lily gritted her teeth.

Were these men blind? How could they ignore someone as stunning as her?

Julian was deliberately avoiding her.

The memory of Lily's tear-streaked makeup still haunted him.

Better to steer clear.

His avoidance weakened Lily's luck even further.

The original storyline had long since derailed.
###Chapter 217: A Suspicious Invitation

Lucy White changed into casual attire, put on a face mask, and took a taxi alone to the restaurant.

This upscale private dining spot was a regular haunt for Julian Chase and his circle. The moment she stepped inside, the manager recognized her instantly.

"Miss White!" The manager barely contained his excitement, though his voice trembled slightly.

Lucy nodded politely. "Please lead the way."

The manager personally escorted her to the private room, then immediately pulled out his phone to tweet: OMG just saw Lucy in person! Even more stunning than on screen! So graceful and sweet—my heart can't take it!

Inside the room, four young men rose to their feet in unison.

"Ian Evans. Heard so much about you."
"Asher York. Finally meeting the real deal."
"Sean Miller. Big fan."
"Benedict Moore. Pleasure."

Lucy removed her mask, her bare face glowing softly under the lights. She took her seat with effortless poise. "Likewise. It's nice to meet you all."

When it came time to order, they insisted she take charge. Without hesitation, Lucy selected several signature dishes.

"So, you know your way around weapons?" Asher suddenly asked.

Lucy arched a brow. "A little. Why?"

"There's a tactical simulation event tomorrow. Interested in joining?"

She set down her teacup. "Why me?"

Asher exchanged glances with the others before confessing, "We're putting together a team for the International Tactical Simulation Championship. We need a female member."

"After seeing your performance on Island Survival, we think you'd be perfect."

Lucy tapped her fingers lightly against the table. "Details."

"It's a globally livestreamed 6D holographic competition," Asher lowered his voice. "The arena is real, but everything else is a virtual simulation."

"Live ammunition is involved, so weapon proficiency is a must."

A glint flashed in Lucy's eyes. In her past life, she'd heard of this groundbreaking event—where the national team lost narrowly due to a last-minute substitution.

"Why me? I'm not the only female celebrity who knows weapons."

Asher grimaced. "The rules require each team to have at least one woman. We tried recruiting from military families, but..."

"Either their stamina was lacking, or their reflexes were too slow," Ian cut in. "We can't afford dead weight."

The room fell silent.

Lucy swirled her tea, her pensive reflection rippling in the cup.

"And you're so sure I won't hold you back?"
###Chapter 218: Just Do Me This Favor

After hearing Asher York's explanation, Lucy White finally understood why they'd formed a four-person team for the international arena livestream in her past life.

Turns out, they couldn’t find a suitable female teammate.

She arched a brow with a light laugh. "Even if I fit the bill, why would you assume I’d join?"

Asher looked confident. "Because of your career."

"You’re a celebrity who just regained popularity through a reality show, but fame in the entertainment industry is fleeting."

"This international competition will keep you relevant—maybe even elevate your status."

"If we make it to the top three—or win—you’ll gain global exposure. Most in the industry would kill for this opportunity."

Had his original teammate not dropped out, this chance would’ve never fallen into Lucy’s lap.

Of course, he’d only seen her in Island Survival and thought she might work. Whether she actually qualified remained to be tested.

Lucy noted that this man wasn’t just intelligent—he was also persuasive.

"That does sound tempting."

She paused. "When’s the competition?"

"Mid-next month," Asher replied. "We have a month to prepare."

"So you’re saying yes?" He grinned.

Lucy smiled. "You made it sound like I’d be losing a fortune if I refused. Fine, I’ll give it a shot."

Asher admired her decisiveness. "Great. Tomorrow, we’ll start with tactical simulation."

"Fair warning—just being decent won’t cut it. I need to evaluate your weapon handling and adaptability."

"The competition’s difficulty is hellish. Choosing teammates requires extreme caution."

Their analysis showed that losing even one member drastically reduced their chances of making top three. That’s why they urgently needed a replacement.

The real challenge? Finding a high-caliber female teammate of the same nationality. The difficulty was doubled.

Hence, his trip back home to scout for candidates.

Lucy nodded. "Understood."

"But I have filming tomorrow. Let’s do it the day after."

Her new drama was on a tight schedule, and she didn’t want to hold things up. She planned to wrap her scenes tomorrow so she could take leave afterward.

Asher agreed easily. "No problem. I’ll call the others over then."

There was an unshakable confidence in Lucy that made him think she might actually pull this off.

Might as well have the whole team assess her at once—saved him the trouble of explaining later.

Lucy accepted the challenge without hesitation. "Bring it on."

Julian Chase and the others only just learned why Asher had returned.

Ian Evans hooked an arm around Asher’s neck. "You kept something this big from us? Some friend you are!"

Asher let him hang there. "Wanted it to be a surprise. Guess the cat’s out of the bag now."

His original plan was to notify them when the competition started so they could watch.

Julian rolled his eyes. "More like a shock."

Then, with typical vanity, he added, "If it weren’t for the female teammate requirement, I could’ve joined."

Asher scoffed. "Please. You’ve let your skills rust."

"Stick to being a playboy."

Julian bristled. "Hey! I’ve got an image to maintain in front of Lucy!"

Sure, he was a flirt—but he wasn’t that kind of guy!

Asher quickly explained to Lucy, "We joke around like this all the time. Don’t mind him."

Lucy chuckled. "No worries."

Julian’s character wasn’t her concern anyway.

By the end of dinner, Lucy had warmed up to the group and exchanged contacts.

They then dragged her to a bar.

To their credit, they didn’t pressure her to drink or cause trouble—just genuine camaraderie.

Lucy ordered a cocktail and chatted casually.

As the night wound down, Ian sidled up to her.

"Lucy, can I ask about that talisman again?"

He explained, "It’s for my uncle."

"He’s been sickly since childhood—prone to attracting negative energy."

"Wearing a jade amulet from Green Sun Temple helped, but it shattered in a car accident."

"He’s hospitalized again, and it’s hard to watch..."

He and his uncle were close in age and shared a deep bond.

The others chimed in. "Yeah, his uncle’s in bad shape. Help him out, Lucy?"
###Chapter 219: She Won't Hold Back Anymore

Lucy White had a favorable impression of the people before her.

After a moment of contemplation, she said, "Your uncle's condition seems quite unique. A standard protective charm might not be enough—it needs to be custom-made."

Ian Evans' eyes lit up. "How exactly would that work?"

They had consulted renowned doctors both domestically and abroad. His grandfather had even sought help from two highly respected spiritual masters, only to be politely declined.

The jade pendant had been gifted by Master Qingyuan as repayment for a life-saving favor—its value was beyond measure.

Unable to contain his urgency, Ian pressed, "What exactly needs to be done?"

Lucy explained, "We’d need to tailor a solution based on his specific constitution—either a permanent cure or a long-term management method."

"But since I haven’t met your uncle, I can’t give a definitive plan."

Hope flickered in Ian’s eyes. "Then could you come see him in person?"

"Lucy, please—do this as a favor to me." His tone was earnest. "If you can cure my uncle, the entire Evans family will owe you."

This was the first time he had ever lowered himself to plead with someone. But for his uncle, it was worth it.

Lucy softened at his sincerity. She had always been moved by genuine familial devotion.

"Alright. Set up a time, and I’ll take a look."

Ian nearly jumped at the opportunity. "How about tomorrow? I’ll pick you up after filming."

Thinking of how she’d feel if it were her brother suffering, Lucy nodded. "Fine. Contact me after wrap."

"Thank you!" Relief washed over Ian’s face.

He wasn’t sure if Lucy could solve the problem, but having witnessed her abilities firsthand, he had to try—even if the chance was slim.

Shortly after eleven, Lucy got up to leave.

Julian Chase insisted on arranging a chauffeur to take her home.

The bar was an exclusive members-only establishment, frequented by the elite.

Downstairs in the lounge, Fiona Von was on a date with her wealthy boyfriend.

"Isn’t that Julian Chase and his group?" her boyfriend murmured.

A friend chimed in, "Julian’s a regular here."

Her boyfriend chuckled self-deprecatingly. "Too bad they don’t know me—I’d love to say hello."

Fiona barely registered the conversation, her gaze locked onto Lucy.

She recognized her instantly—the woman who had snatched the jade rough at the auction, Grace White’s daughter!

"Who exactly are those people?" she asked, feigning nonchalance.

Her boyfriend’s expression turned serious. "Top-tier heirs, especially Julian Chase. His family’s connections run deep, and he owns a billion-dollar conglomerate."

"If you ever take over Gould Group, don’t cross them."

Fiona’s nails dug into her palms.

She had long considered Gould Group her birthright. Now, Grace White and her daughter had appeared out of nowhere, threatening everything.

And to make matters worse, Lucy had somehow ingratiated herself with Julian’s circle!

"Not feeling well?" her boyfriend asked with false concern.

Fiona forced a smile. "Just a headache."

The moment she returned to the Von estate, she sought out her mother, Giselle Gould.

"Mother, that bitch has gotten close to Julian Chase!"

Gleaming malice flashed in Giselle’s eyes. "I planned to deal with them slowly, but it seems we’ll have to act sooner."

She would never allow anyone to jeopardize their claim to Gould Group.

If they insisted on courting death, then she wouldn’t hold back anymore.
###Chapter 220: Your Smug Days Are Numbered

The next morning, Lucy White arrived at the set bright and early.

"Director Jude, I'd like to film tomorrow's scenes today," she said bluntly.

Director Jude agreed without hesitation. Coincidentally, Lily Green had taken the morning off, so he scheduled Lucy's scenes first.

It wasn't until three in the afternoon that Lily finally made her grand entrance.

Lucy glanced up to see Lily glowing, her eyes brimming with satisfaction. It wasn't hard to guess what had happened the night before.

However, Lily's aura hadn't noticeably strengthened, which meant her companion had either been Oliver Knight or Ian Stone.

Lucy leaned toward the former—otherwise, someone as calculating as Lily wouldn't have dared to show up so late.

Sure enough, the moment Lily stepped onto the set, she simpered, "Director Jude, I'm so sorry. Mr. Knight insisted I accompany him to meet a client. It took longer than expected."

Her words were apologetic, but her eyes gleamed with smug triumph.

Director Jude snorted. Did she really think name-dropping Oliver would intimidate him? The woman clearly overestimated herself.

"Go get your makeup done," he dismissed her with a wave.

In the makeup room, Lucy was removing her stage makeup when Lily sauntered in with a sneer.

"Oh, Ms. White, leaving early again?"

Lucy didn't even look up. "I've already finished tomorrow's scenes. Should I stick around just to watch you put on airs?"

"Some people have such big attitudes for such small careers," Lucy scoffed. "Do you really think you're A-list material?"

The barb struck a nerve. If Lucy hadn't stolen the spotlight at every turn, Lily wouldn't still be languishing as a third-rate actress.

"Fortunes change," Lily spat through gritted teeth. "Don't look down on the young and struggling!"

"I only know one saying," Lucy rose to her full height, looking down at her. "What goes around comes around."

With that, she grabbed her bag and strode out.

The makeup artist and the third female lead struggled to suppress their laughter. Lily had always treated them with condescension—it was satisfying to see her taken down a peg.

"What are you staring at?" Lily snapped at the third lead, face burning with humiliation.

The third lead shot back, "At your inflated ego!" before slamming the door behind her.

Lily stomped her foot in frustration and whipped out her phone to text Oliver: [Lucy turned the whole crew against me!]

His reply came instantly: [Don't worry. She'll get what's coming to her.]

Remembering Oliver's promises from the night before, Lily finally smirked. "Lucy White, let's see how long your smug act lasts!"

Meanwhile, Lucy, having wrapped early, texted Ian Evans.

As she exited the studio, she spotted Ian and Julian Chase leaning against a flashy convertible.

"Over here!" Julian waved enthusiastically.

Lucy massaged her temples. "Just send me the address. I'll take a cab."

"Why?" they asked in unison.

"That car is too conspicuous," she sighed. "I don't need to trend on social media tomorrow."

Ian's eyes widened in realization before he shot Julian an annoyed glare. "This is why I told you not to bring this one!"

In the end, Lucy took a taxi alone to the hospital.

En route, Ian sent the location—the most exclusive private hospital in the capital.

When she arrived, Ian and Julian had been waiting at the entrance.

The VIP ward occupied an entire floor. As the door opened, a slender figure stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Hearing the noise, the man turned.

Though illness had left him gaunt, it couldn't diminish his gentle, refined demeanor.

"You must be Ms. White," he smiled. "I've heard so much about you."

Ian hurried to introduce them. "Lucy, this is my uncle, Evan Evans."

"Mr. Evans," Lucy nodded politely.
###Chapter 221: The 49-Day Miracle

Lucy White's slender fingers swiped across the tablet screen, closing the confidential files from the special department. Today, she had deliberately chosen a beige trench coat that made her skin appear snow-white.

"CEO of Evans Group, tech tycoon," she murmured to herself, pausing at the line that read "holographic tech R&D."

As she pushed open the VIP suite door, the crisp scent of cedar greeted her. Sunlight streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows divided the three-hundred-square-meter space into geometric patterns, where a lean figure stood with his back to her by the window.

"Ms. White." When the man turned, Lucy took in his face—pale as parchment, yet with eyes sharp as a hawk's.

Ian Evans grinned beside him: "Uncle, this is the expert I told you about!"

A faint smile lifted Ethan Evans' lips, breathing life into his features. "An honor."

The aroma of tea soon filled the air. Lucy noticed the obsidian bracelet on his wrist, its surface shimmering with an eerie blue sheen under the sunlight.

"This is..." She narrowed her eyes.

Ethan followed her gaze. "A protective charm. Useless, unfortunately."

Lucy abruptly set down her cup. "Mr. Evans, have you been waking precisely at 3 a.m. every night?"

The teacup trembled slightly in his grasp.

"Moreover," she continued, "you avoid elevators because enclosed spaces make you feel suffocated."

Ian's cup clattered to the floor.

"How did you—" Ethan finally showed genuine surprise.

Lucy tapped her temple. "The miasma between your brows is nearly tangible." She leaned forward suddenly. "Spent time in a graveyard as a child?"

The room plunged into silence.

"Seven days," Ethan rasped. "Kidnappers hid me in a tomb."

Julian Chase inhaled sharply—even the Evans family knew little about this.

Lucy produced a jade box from her bag. "Vitality elixir. One course lasts seven days." Her lips curved mysteriously. "In forty-nine days, you'll be boarding a plane to inspect that holographic tech."

"Forty-nine days?" Ian's voice cracked. "The specialists said my uncle—"

"What they can't cure doesn't mean I can't." Lucy spun the box in her palm. "The question is whether Mr. Evans dares to gamble."

Ethan studied her, then chuckled low. "Know what I'm best at, Ms. White?"

"Taking risks." He accepted the box, his icy fingers brushing her wrist—leaving a searing imprint.

Outside, a plane tree leaf drifted onto the windowsill. As Lucy met those fathomless eyes, she suddenly understood—this treatment might be far more complicated than she'd anticipated.
###Chapter 222: The Watchful Crowd

Lucy White had never been one to embellish her abilities with flowery words.

Whether it was geomancy or healing, her approach remained consistent.

The treatment plan lay before them—believing or not was entirely their choice.

If they trusted her, she would help. If not, she wouldn’t force it.

Hard sell? Absolutely out of the question.

Her bluntness left Ian Evans and his uncle momentarily stunned.

Seeing her unwavering confidence, their doubts gradually faded.

After a brief silence, the older man spoke. "Miss White, do you have any of your vitality elixirs on hand? I’d like to purchase a seven-course treatment."

Though he had long made peace with mortality, the prospect of decades more was undeniably tempting.

Lucy shook her head. "I don’t keep them in stock."

"The formula must be tailored to your constitution."

"Since I’ve agreed to help, I’ll see it through."

"But you’ll need to procure the ingredients. I’ll handle the preparation."

"One million for the labor," she stated plainly.

The crafting process wasn’t difficult for her.

The real challenge? She alone possessed this formula.

The older man exhaled in relief.

Money meant nothing to him.

His purpose had never been wealth accumulation, but using it to create value—repaying his family’s unwavering support.

"Done," he agreed readily. "Please provide the ingredient list."

Lucy penned it swiftly.

When he accepted the paper, his eyes first caught on her elegant calligraphy.

Only eleven components were listed—but each required specimens over seventy years old.

No wonder she had no ready supply.

"I’ll gather them promptly," he said, carefully tucking away the list.

Lucy knew the Evans family’s resources would make short work of the task.

Ian suddenly recalled the protective amulet.

"Lucy, could you spare one jade talisman for my uncle first?"

"Name your price," he added hastily.

She shot him a look. "My prices are fixed. I don’t engage in price gouging."

Two million per jade amulet—no exceptions.

Ian chuckled awkwardly. "Of course, of course. Your integrity is beyond question."

He’d hoped to persuade her to prioritize his uncle with a premium, but she’d seen right through him.

Normally he’d have stormed off—but today, he kept smiling.

Lucy relented slightly. "The jade amulets are still being infused. None are ready yet."

Seeing their disappointment, she added, "But I can prepare a temporary vitality talisman."

"Wear it for three days, and you can go about normally without episodes."

"However, it’s merely a stopgap—not a cure."

Ian sighed in relief, then pressed, "Would it protect him like Julian Chase’s did?"

"My uncle’s had two near-fatal accidents..."

Lucy laughed. "You think these are wholesale market cabbages?"

"Each one drains significant energy. Recovery takes time."

This was half-true.

Ethan Smith’s late-night call had warned her—certain authorities had taken notice of Julian’s talisman.

Discretion was now necessary.

"Your uncle’s accidents stem from his yin constitution."

"The vitality talisman stabilizes that, preventing mishaps."

"Relax. His current fortune shows no imminent danger."

"He’ll receive a jade amulet once they’re ready."

Only then did Ian settle. "Promise?"

"If there are extras..." He rubbed his hands together suggestively.

Julian cut in sharply: "Dream on! I’m already in line!"

"Special circumstances warrant one exception. You’re at the back!"

He even winked at Lucy.

Lucy: "..."

Was this secretly a comedian?

"We’ll discuss quantities later. Two per person is impossible."

She still needed to find optimal geomancy sites to nurture the jade.

The older man remained composed. "A cure would be blessing enough."

Lucy nodded inwardly.

This very equanimity had sustained him.

A more impatient soul wouldn’t have survived this long.

"Reserving one for you isn’t an issue."

"Though curable, thirty years of damage leaves residual effects."

"Long-term wear aids recovery."

The older man smiled gratefully. "My thanks, Miss White."
###Chapter 223: Who Else Could It Be?

Lucy's fingers moved deftly as she finished crafting a vitality talisman. She handed it to Ian Evans with brief instructions before taking her leave.

Ian insisted on escorting her to the elevator, where his brother had already arranged a chauffeur. The sleek black sedan, fitted with one-way tinted windows, pulled away from the hospital with quiet discretion.

When Lucy arrived home, Grace was just stepping through the door.

"Mom, how’s the land prep coming along?" Lucy took her mother’s bag.

Grace brightened. "The fields at the base are ready—perfect for seasonal vegetables."

"The mid-slope will be good for corn and peanuts," she counted on her fingers, "and the sunny patch at the top is ideal for medicinal herbs. Sophie promised to help source the seeds. We’ll start next week."

Lucy handed her a glass of water. "Don’t overdo it."

"Overdo it?" Grace chuckled. "I’d live out there if I could."

Lowering her voice, she added, "I found a flat spot—perfect for a cottage."

Lucy’s eyes curved into crescents. "Funny, I was just thinking the same thing."

"Let’s build something spacious—a garden, a koi pond, maybe a couple of guard dogs." She smirked. "Just in case certain people get ideas."

Grace nodded knowingly, but her smile faltered. "Your father always talked about building a place like this when we retired..."

Lucy squeezed her mother’s cool hand. "He’ll come back." Her voice was firm. "I checked with the compass. He’s alive."

Grace’s eyes reddened as she whispered, "I know."

"Where’s Noah?" Lucy changed the subject.

"Out sketching with classmates." Grace wiped her eyes. "He’s been so much livelier lately."

That evening, Felix Cooper’s call came abruptly.

"You’re trending," he said grimly.

Lucy arched a brow. "Leaked set photos?"

"Worse." His words tumbled out. "Someone’s claiming you’re talentless, demanding, and that you slept your way into the role. The bots are already swarming."

Lucy scoffed. "Who else would it be but those two?" Her fingers tapped the table. "Oliver Knight must be spending a fortune on Lily Green."

Felix asked, "Should we counter?"

"Not yet." A smirk played on her lips. "Let them dance a little longer."

Her eyes glinted. "The higher they jump, the harder they’ll fall."
###Chapter 224: Too Late

Lucy White listened to Felix Cooper's report, a knowing smile playing at the corners of her lips.

"Don't rush to clarify things just yet," she said, tapping her fingers lightly on the desk. "This controversy is perfect for promoting our new drama."

Director Jude Miller's xianxia drama was being filmed and released simultaneously, meaning it would soon reach audiences.

When the time came, viewers would judge the acting for themselves. Trying to clear her name now would only seem desperate.

"The more they criticize me now, the more curious people will be to watch when it airs."

A glint of cunning flashed in her eyes. "Let's give Lily Green a little push."

"Buy more troll accounts to praise her acting skills relentlessly. Make 'Lily Green Outshines Lucy White' trend everywhere."

Felix immediately caught on, chuckling. "Brilliant. She wants to climb over you? We'll send her straight to the stratosphere."

Everyone knew the principle of overkill. A little hype could be convincing, but when the entire internet was flooded with identical praise...

"It's just a shame you'll have to endure the backlash for a while," Felix said sympathetically.

Lucy waved it off. "Bad publicity is still publicity. Besides..."

She opened her phone's gallery, where several video clips lay untouched.

"When the time is right, these will come in handy."

Felix glimpsed a corner of the footage and nodded in understanding. "So you were prepared all along."

"But it's not time yet." Lucy put her phone away. "Let her enjoy her moment a little longer."

She'd noticed Lily's luck was rapidly draining lately. Once it hit a certain threshold...

"Oh, we should still address the diva rumors," Felix reminded her.

Lucy agreed. "I'll visit the set the day after tomorrow and ask Director Jude to help clarify."

After hanging up, Lucy scrolled through social media. The hashtag #LucyWhiteIsADiva had already climbed to the top three trending topics.

The most ridiculous part? Someone had even blamed her for Hugo Shaw's divorce.

But before she could respond, Hugo himself posted a clarification—along with another round of evidence about being cheated on.

More surprisingly, the drama's third female lead suddenly voiced support:

[@LinXiaowan: Working with Lucy is amazing! She treats the whole crew to bubble tea all the time—how is that being a diva?]

Soon, Ryan Choi, Director Jude, and other crew members reposted it. Even a production assistant shared photos of snacks Lucy had given them.

Lucy's fans immediately rallied, launching a massive counterattack.

[We always knew our Lucy was kindhearted!]
[How’s that slap taste, haters?]

Warmth spread through Lucy as she read the messages. Kindness paid off when it mattered most.

Felix moved quickly. That night, countless articles flooded every platform:

[Lily Green’s Acting Dwarfs So-Called Stars]
[This Is What Real Talent Looks Like]

Trending lists, live comments, forums—the entire internet seemed to praise Lily. Even food videos had comments like "Way better than Lucy White."

By the time Oliver Knight's team noticed something was wrong, public opinion had spiraled out of control.

"We can't suppress it now," the PR director said nervously. "The engagement is too high. Forcing it would backfire."

Oliver smashed a glass. "Idiots! We’ve been played!"

Meanwhile, Lucy leisurely sipped floral tea as Felix's message lit up her phone:

[Trending’s exploded. Now the whole internet’s asking who Lily Green even is.]

She took another sip, her smile deepening.

The real show was just beginning.
###Chapter 225: Stunning Performance

While Oliver Knight's team was still scrambling to clean up their mess, Lucy White had already fallen into a peaceful slumber.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Lucy stretched lazily before changing into her workout gear for a jog. By the time she finished breakfast, Asher York's car was already waiting downstairs.

"You're early," Lucy remarked with a smile as she opened the car door.

"Couldn't wait to see you in action," Asher winked.

To her surprise, Julian Chase and his three friends had also tagged along, each accompanied by female companions.

"Group spectators?" Lucy arched an eyebrow.

Julian cleared his throat. "The more, the merrier."

In truth, they'd brought the women along to spare Lucy potential embarrassment if she struggled—though he'd never admit that.

At the elite tactical simulation field on the outskirts, Lucy and the other women headed to the locker room to gear up.

"Your skin is flawless, Miss White," one girl in form-fitting tactical gear admired.

"Even prettier than on screen," another chimed in.

Lucy smiled politely and quickly changed into her camouflage suit. When she emerged, three unfamiliar men had joined Asher.

"Meet the team," Asher introduced enthusiastically. "Finn Wallace, Xavier Boone, and Jasper King."

The trio offered polite greetings, but their assessing gazes betrayed their skepticism—could this delicate-looking celebrity really handle firearms?

"How about teams?" Asher suggested. "Lucy with us, Julian you take the ladies."

Julian immediately protested, "That's not fair!"

"Scared?" Jasper taunted with a smirk.

"Bring it on!" Julian rolled up his sleeves. "Don't come crying later!"

Once teams were set, Lucy followed Asher's squad into the jungle zone. No sooner had they settled in than Jasper crossed his arms. "Since this is an evaluation, we'll leave it to you."

The implication was clear—she'd take on the opposing team alone.

Lucy's lips curved. "Perfect."

After efficiently checking her gear, she vanished into the foliage like a shadow.

In the monitoring room, Finn pulled up live footage. Lucy moved with panther-like grace, silently closing in on enemy territory.

"That speed..." Xavier adjusted his glasses.

Suddenly, Lucy struck. A rapid series of shots rang out as Julian's female companions stared blankly at the paint splattering their vests.

"What just—?" one girl gasped, touching her marked chest.

Julian spun toward the commotion only to take a direct hit from a concealed position.

"No way!" He gaped at the paint on his vest before looking up.

Lucy emerged from behind a tree, her marker gun still emitting a wisp of smoke.

"My win," she said mildly.

Jasper checked the timer: "Three minutes forty-two seconds."

"Precise marksmanship, decisive execution," Finn noted.

Asher grinned triumphantly. "Satisfied?"

The three men exchanged glances, identical expressions of approval dawning. This seemingly fragile starlet had delivered one hell of a surprise.
###Chapter 226: This Woman Is Terrifying

Finn Wallace and his two teammates exchanged uneasy glances. None of them had expected Lucy White to be this formidable.

Xavier Boone adjusted his glasses, his eyes gleaming behind the lenses. "Winning one round isn't enough. Your friends are just terrible."

"Next match, Lucy leads her team against all four of us."

As the tactical mind of their squad, Xavier's suggestion was immediately approved by the others.

Finn smirked. "If she lasts half an hour, I'll acknowledge her as a teammate."

The four shared a knowing look—none of them believed Lucy stood a chance.

Meanwhile, Julian Chase and his group were still reeling from their defeat.

"We... lost just like that?" Ian Evans rubbed the back of his head, bewildered.

Benedict Moore stared at his gun. "I didn't even get to fire a shot."

Julian's expression darkened. He'd grown up in military training camps, yet a woman had wiped the floor with him.

"This woman..." he ground out between clenched teeth, "plays dirty."

As they wallowed in frustration, Asher York approached and announced the new team arrangement.

"No way!" Ian was the first to protest.

Julian held him back. "Follow orders." His gaze flicked to Lucy, conflicted.

Before the second round began, Lucy pulled out a sheet of paper and swiftly sketched a detailed map of the entire arena.

"You're cheating?" Julian blurted.

Lucy shot him a withering look. "I memorized the layout from our last round."

"Photographic memory?" Ian gaped.

"Something like that," Lucy replied casually.

The other girls stared at her in awe, while Julian's resentment gave way to curiosity.

Just how many tricks did this woman have up her sleeve?

The battle began. Lucy directed the girls to take cover while she slipped unseen toward the enemy base.

Boom!

The explosion rang out while Asher's team was still searching for targets.

"What the—?" Xavier's face paled.

The radio crackled with a staff member's voice: "Base destroyed. Game over."

Round three. Round four.

No matter how they adjusted their tactics, Lucy always found a way to dismantle them.

"Damn it!" Finn threw his helmet down. "Can she read minds or something?"

In the surveillance room, the four rewatched the footage.

Xavier suddenly laughed. "She's not reading minds..."

"She's reading us."
###Chapter 227: Unexpected Call

Finn Wallace and the others exchanged glances, their eyes alight with excitement.

Their previous teammates had been top-tier, but Lucy White's performance surpassed even that.

After training, the group showered and changed before heading out for dinner.

Julian Chase dismissed his friends and shamelessly tagged along with Lucy's team.

In the private dining room, Xavier Boone, as team captain, stood first and extended his hand to Lucy.

"Welcome aboard," he said with admiration. "From today onward, we're partners in this."

Lucy shook his hand, a faint smile on her lips. "I'll give it my all."

"What's your schedule like?" Xavier asked. "We'll need time to build synergy."

She thought for a moment. "I can spare a day in three days. After that, I have filming out of town, but I'll wrap up my scenes and return as soon as possible."

She understood the importance of teamwork.

Xavier nodded in understanding. Finding someone like Lucy was already a stroke of luck—they didn’t want to pressure her.

The atmosphere grew lively as the meal progressed.

Julian asked curiously, "Is the actual competition like what we did today?"

"Much more complex," Asher York chuckled. "We'll be given a virtual world scenario with objectives to complete."

Finn added, "Rumor has it this year's is a hell-mode challenge using cutting-edge holographic tech."

"Global livestream—guaranteed to be spectacular." He winked at Julian. "Make sure to cheer for us."

Julian grinned. "I'll be watching every second." He glanced subtly at Lucy, already resolved to follow the entire event.

When exchanging contacts after dinner, Julian insisted on driving Lucy home.

In the car, he asked casually, "Need help with that online mess?"

Lucy shook her head. "It's nothing I can't handle."

"We're just acquaintances. No need to trouble yourself, Mr. Chase."

Julian smirked. "I thought we were at least friends." He sighed dramatically. "So cold. It hurts."

Lucy arched a brow. His shamelessness was truly something else.

Then she abruptly changed the subject. "Do you know Jessica Chase?"

Julian's expression didn’t falter. "My sister."

"She dislikes me," Lucy stated bluntly. "We have history."

"I know," he admitted. "She resents you because of Ethan Smith."

"But she's her, and I'm me." He turned to Lucy. "I won’t deny I had ulterior motives at first, but now I genuinely want to be your friend."

He paused. "Jessica’s been sent to Africa. The Chase family won’t interfere in your affairs."

Lucy studied his face, gauging his sincerity.

"Acquaintances, then," she finally said.

Julian's eyes gleamed. "Friends."

Just then, Lucy's phone rang. The caller ID—"Michael Johnson"—made her frown slightly.

"What is it?" she answered.

Michael's urgent voice came through. "Lucy! Grace and Noah are in trouble!"
###Chapter 228: What Are Your Intentions?

Lucy White's brows furrowed instantly.

Her fingers dug into her palms unconsciously. Though she sensed her mother and brother were unharmed, her heart still clenched painfully.

"What happened?" Her voice was tight with tension.

Michael Johnson's voice came through the phone. "Someone targeted Aunt Grace. Fortunately, you were prepared—the assassin failed."

"Noah's protective charm suddenly burned up. The chase drained him, and now he's exhausted."

His mother had dragged him to help Aunt Grace today.

Who would have expected an ambush? They were forced into the mountains, their energy nearly depleted.

Though they escaped unscathed, the ordeal left them shaken.

After descending, Aunt Grace wanted to call Lucy, but he volunteered instead.

Lucy immediately understood who was behind this.

"Are Mom and Noah hurt?" Her voice trembled with worry.

Michael replied, "They're fine, thanks to your protective charms. Aunt Grace was prepared—she handled the attacker."

Today, he'd witnessed a side of Aunt Grace that left him stunned.

Only then did Lucy relax.

She knew exactly how that mother-daughter pair operated. Now that her family was exposed, the same hired-killer plot from her past life would repeat.

That's why she had warned her mother in advance, crafted protective charms, and even carved jade pendants infused with spiritual energy—bulletproof and impact-resistant—as a double safeguard.

She just hadn’t expected them to strike so soon.

"Where are you? I'm coming now," she said urgently.

Michael answered, "Still on the mountain. Hurry."

He hadn’t seen Lucy in days, and the longing gnawed at him.

"Got it. Be there soon."

After hanging up, she turned to Julian Chase. "Take me here, please."

Julian immediately changed course, sensing the icy aura around her. "What's wrong?"

During the call, Lucy had radiated danger.

"Family emergency," she said tersely. "I need to check on them."

Julian asked, "Need any help?"

In the capital, he had connections.

Lucy shook her head. "No, I can handle it."

Dealing with those people wasn’t worth troubling others.

Seeing her resolve, he relented. "Just say the word if you need anything."

Lucy nodded. "Thanks."

The car stopped at the mountain's base—the road ahead was impassable.

She unbuckled her seatbelt. "Appreciate the ride."

Julian stepped out too. "I’ll come with you."

Before she could refuse, he added, "I won’t get in the way."

Lucy sighed. "Fine."

After a short walk up the trail, they spotted Michael waiting outside a wooden cabin—a recent retreat Grace had built, fully equipped.

At the sight of Lucy, Michael's stern face brightened. "Lucy!"

Then he noticed the unfamiliar man behind her, and his smile froze.

"Who’s this?" He eyed Julian warily.

Lucy introduced briefly, "Julian Chase, a friend. He insisted on tagging along. Keep him company—I’m going to see Mom."

With that, she headed inside, leaving the two men staring at each other.

Michael sized Julian up. "You’re Lucy’s friend?"

Julian sensed the hostility and disliked him just as much.

But he masked it well, remaining polite. "Yes, a close one. And you?"

Michael straightened. "Childhood friend."

Julian raised a brow. So that was their dynamic.

No wonder this guy rubbed him the wrong way.

He smiled thinly. "Pleasure." As if childhood friends stood a chance against Ethan Smith.

Michael narrowed his eyes. "What are your intentions with Lucy?"

A grown man forcing his way into her business? Definitely shady.

His stomach churned with jealousy. First that scheming Ethan, now this smirking fox?

Lately, he’d been brushing up on internet slang—Julian was practically a male version of a sanctimonious hypocrite.

Julian saw right through him. Another rival.

But a childhood friend who still hadn’t won Lucy over after all these years? Hardly a threat.

He adjusted his cufflinks elegantly. "Intentions? Why so tense?"

Michael scoffed. "Cut the act. Lucy would never go for your type."

Julian remained unruffled. "You don’t seem like her type either."

The two locked eyes, sparks flying between them.

Finally, Michael huffed and looked away.

No way Lucy would fall for a playboy.

Still, better stay vigilant.
###Chapter 229: Revenge Must Be Served

Lucy White pushed open the door to the wooden cabin.

Grace White sat on the couch, cradling her pale son Noah in her arms. When she saw her daughter enter, a flicker of pain crossed her eyes. "Lucy, come check on Noah."

Lucy hurried forward, her fingertips brushing against her brother's icy forehead. Her heart sank.

"Sis..." Noah managed a weak smile. "I'm fine..."

"Don't talk." Lucy cut him off, swiftly retrieving cinnabar ink and talisman paper from her bag.

Rachel Johnson wrung her hands anxiously nearby. "He suddenly fainted earlier—scared us half to death."

Pressing her lips together, Lucy's brush moved with practiced precision. As the talisman completed, a golden light flashed.

"Keep this close." She tucked the charm into Noah's collar.

His breathing gradually steadied as he drifted into deep sleep.

"Those people outside..." Lucy suddenly looked up.

Grace met her daughter's gaze. "I called them."

She pulled a silver emblem from her bag. "After you mentioned the Goulds might hire assassins, I reached out to an old friend."

Lucy took the emblem, its surface engraved with a soaring eagle—the insignia of the international mercenary group "Silver Wings."

Rachel slammed her palm on the table. "The Goulds have gone too far! Targeting a child!"

"Don't worry, Aunt Rachel." Lucy's smile turned icy. "They'll pay for this."

She produced three ancient ritual blade coins, rubbing them between her palms. These were artifacts she'd been cultivating with her cursed dagger, originally meant for later use...

"Mom, I'm visiting the Gould family cemetery tomorrow."

Grace nodded in understanding. "Be careful."

Just then, raised voices carried from outside.

"Sir, you can't go in—"

"I'll wait right here!"

Lucy massaged her temples—she'd almost forgotten about her persistent shadow.

Opening the door, she found Julian Chase squared off against a black-clad mercenary. Spotting her, his expression instantly softened. "Miss White."

Michael Johnson stood glowering nearby like a bristling cat.

"Mom, Aunt Rachel, this is Julian Chase." Lucy made brief introductions.

Julian bowed courteously. "Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. White."

Rachel studied the handsome young man, then glanced at her sulking son with a silent sigh.

"Noah needs rest. Let's head back," Grace said.

Michael immediately stepped forward. "I'll carry him to the car."

Throughout the drive home, Julian's vehicle trailed behind them. At the apartment complex, he rolled down his window. "Need any help?"

Before Lucy could decline, Michael had already charged into the elevator with Noah in his arms.

"Thanks, but we're fine," she said politely.

Undeterred, Julian exited his car. "Let me see you upstairs."

Inside the elevator, Michael stared fixedly at the ascending floor numbers, jaw clenched audibly.

"Tea?" Lucy offered absently after entering the apartment.

"The honor would be mine," Julian smiled.

Michael nearly dropped Noah.

Once her brother was settled, Lucy stood on the balcony, her gaze fixed coldly on the distant Gould Corporation headquarters.

Her phone vibrated with a message from an unknown number:
«Package ready. Green light whenever.»

She deleted it, her expression neutral as she turned around.

In the living room, the two men were engaged in "friendly" conversation, tension crackling between them.

Rachel whispered to Grace, "That Chase boy seems decent."

Grace smiled without comment.

When Lucy entered, both men abruptly stopped bickering.

"Thank you both for today." She poured tea. "But I have matters to attend to..."

The unspoken dismissal was clear.

Julian rose gracefully. "Another time, then."

Michael lingered until his mother's sharp glare dragged him out.

Alone at last, Lucy took out her compass and ritual coins, a dangerous glint in her eyes.

"Gould family... your reckoning has come."
###Chapter 230: Midnight Visit to the Ancestral Graves

Though Julian Chase had a face as thick as a fortress wall, he at least knew when to call it a night.

After finishing his tea at Lucy White's place and staying for about twenty minutes, he tactfully took his leave. His visit was mainly to make a good impression on his future mother-in-law—though if Lucy had known his thoughts, she might have thrown the scalding tea in his face.

Once Julian was gone, Lucy turned to find Michael Johnson staring at her with puppy-dog eyes.

"You're still here?" she arched a brow.

Michael pouted. "Can't I stay a little longer?" He grumbled, "What's so great about that smirking fox anyway? You even served him tea."

Lucy rolled her eyes. "He gave me two rides. The least I could do was offer him a cup."

Michael's eyes brightened. "So you're not into him?"

"What are you thinking?" She shot him another exasperated look. "I've only met him a handful of times."

At that, Michael broke into a grin.

Lucy suddenly crooked a finger at him. "Got nothing better to do? Come help me with something big."

She'd been looking for a free chauffeur anyway.

Michael's eyes lit up instantly. "Let's go!"

Dinner plans could wait—getting into mischief with Lucy was far more important.

Lucy packed a bag, told her mother she was heading out, and soon they were in the underground parking lot where Michael eagerly held the car door open for her.

"Take us here," she said, giving him an address.

The two-hour drive passed with idle chatter, never dull.

By nightfall, they arrived at the foot of a mountain.

"Here." Lucy handed him a flashlight. "We're going up."

Michael frowned. "What are we doing here in the middle of the night?"

"The Gould family ancestral graves are here," she said coldly. "What do you think I'm here for?"

"You're messing with their graves?" He blinked, then grinned. "Brilliant!"

The rugged mountain path took half an hour to navigate before they located the Gould family plot.

Lucy pulled out a set of ancient ritual blade coins. "Bury these at seventy-centimeter intervals."

Michael took the entrenching tool and got to work while Lucy busied herself arranging talismans and adjusting the geomantic alignment.

Suddenly, a sharp cry cut through the night.

Michael had fallen, his palm sliced open by one of the coins, blood instantly staining the ancient metal.

Lucy rushed over—just in time to see a wisp of dark energy seep into his wound.

"You okay?" she asked, frowning.

He shook his head. "Just tripped."

After tending to his injury, they finished the setup and descended the mountain.

"So when will the Goulds start having bad luck?" Michael asked eagerly on the drive back.

"Starting tomorrow. Full effect in a week." Lucy leaned back, eyes closed. The toll of drawing talismans and setting up the array had drained her.

Noticing her exhaustion, Michael quietly turned down the AC.

The car glided smoothly through the night toward the city.

That evening, Michael had a long, unsettling dream.

When he woke, his pillow was damp with sweat.
###Chapter 231: Michael Johnson's Past Life - Side Story I

Michael had a long dream.

In the dream, he returned to when he was eight years old. His mother held his hand as they walked into Aunt Grace's garden. Sunlight filtered through the plane tree leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground.

"Michael, this is Lucy," his mother's gentle voice murmured beside him.

He saw a delicate little girl sitting on the swing. She wore a pale yellow dress, clutching a lollipop in her small, fair hand. When she noticed him approaching, she lifted her face and gave him a sweet smile.

At that moment, he heard the sound of his own heartbeat.

From that day on, he took a detour to Aunt Grace's house every day after school. Lucy would always wait for him by the windowsill, running out excitedly the moment she spotted him.

"Big Brother Michael!" Her soft, childish voice became the most beautiful melody in his life.

On the first day of elementary school, he stood at the school gate and watched as the little girl in her uniform came bouncing toward him. Under the sunlight, her twin braids swayed, and her backpack swung behind her.

"Big Brother Michael, can we go to school together?" She tilted her small face up, her eyes brimming with hope.

Of course, he said yes.

From then on, he had a little shadow following him everywhere. She would pout and beg him to carry her backpack or whine for snacks. He pretended to grumble but always saved the best treats for her.

Lucy was brilliant. After skipping several grades, she was only one year behind him. On the first day of middle school, he found her standing at the school gate, her eyes red. His heart twisted painfully.

"Skip another grade and catch up to me," he said, ruffling her hair.

The following spring, she did just that. Wearing her middle school uniform, she stood under the sunlight, smiling at him with crescent-shaped eyes.

In high school, his father moved them back to the capital. Before leaving, he found Lucy crying in her room. Through the door, he promised, "We'll video call every day."

At university, he became the campus heartthrob. But when that familiar figure appeared at the school gate, everything else faded into insignificance.

"Big Brother Michael!" She threw herself into his arms, carrying the familiar scent of gardenias.

The student council members often teased, "Your little sweetheart is here with lunch again." He kept a stern face, but his heart swelled with warmth.

After graduation, his grandparents wanted him to enter an arranged marriage. He scoffed and turned to the entertainment industry instead. When Lucy confessed her feelings, he pretended to be annoyed—only to pull her into a tight embrace the moment she turned away.

"No take-backs," he whispered against her ear.

But showbiz was a viper's nest. Afraid she'd get hurt, he deliberately distanced himself, hoping she'd give up. Until the day someone hurled acid at him—and a stranger leaped in front of him...

(To be revealed: This "savior" was actually part of an elaborate scheme. Unbeknownst to Michael, Lucy was in a hospital room at that very moment, silently losing their child...)
###Chapter 232: Michael Johnson's Alternate Life (Part 2)

In his dream, Michael saw another version of himself acting like a fool—desperately trying to please a girl named Lily Green.

He showered her with resources, connections, and opportunities.

He even instructed his agent, Richard Brown, to give her special treatment, unaware that the two were already secretly involved.

The strangest part? Every time he saw Lily, he couldn’t help but feel compelled to be good to her, as if under some spell.

His mother was the first to notice something was off. With a cold expression, she warned him, "Lucy White is the only one I'll accept as my daughter-in-law. If you betray her, don’t call me your mother anymore."

His father also sat him down for a serious talk. "Lucy is the right person for you. Don’t wait until you lose her to realize that."

The most shocking was his grandmother, who suddenly stopped pressuring him into an arranged marriage and even agreed to let him marry Lucy.

He didn’t have romantic feelings for Lily—he was just grateful because she’d once saved him. Yet, an insistent voice in his head kept urging him: Be good to Lily. Repay her.

His family’s interference only made him more rebellious.

When his mother bought an apartment and arranged for him to live with Lucy, he felt like his entire life was being controlled—even his marriage.

When his family started pushing for marriage, he snapped.

Despite his defiance, he never considered breaking up with Lucy.

After moving in together, Lucy still cooked for him every day and playfully demanded his attention. He secretly adored it, but the pressure about marriage made him irritable, and he’d deliberately act cold toward her.

More often than not, he chose to stay away, burying himself in filming and rarely coming home.

They lived together, yet they barely even kissed. He often wanted to, but his pride wouldn’t let him.

Every time they went out, if Lily called, he’d abandon Lucy without hesitation.

Lucy quickly caught on, and they had a huge fight.

Lily was special—she was the first person who’d ever stood up for him. But no matter what, he couldn’t develop romantic feelings for her. He just couldn’t stop himself from being good to her.

Lily dropped hints about her feelings, even tried to seduce him. But he felt nothing—only guilt when he thought of Lucy.

Strangely, every time he tried to make it up to Lucy, Lily would "coincidentally" need him. That voice would return: Repay Lily. Be good to her.

On their anniversary, he stood Lucy up again—for Lily.

Here, the dream began to diverge from reality.

Though furious, Lucy didn’t break up with him.

When he was photographed picking Lily up from the police station, he followed Richard’s suggestion and let Lucy take the blame.

No matter how much he indulged Lily, he didn’t want to be linked to her romantically. Making Lucy the scapegoat would also pave the way for their eventual public relationship.

But things spiraled out of control.

Buried in work and with Richard sabotaging things behind the scenes, he failed to notice the online harassment Lucy was enduring from his fans.

Richard arranged a live reality show. He only agreed to join because Lucy was participating.

Then Lily showed up.

In the dream, the show played out differently. Lily shone brightly, her popularity soaring, while Lucy was maliciously edited into a villain.

Something felt off. Lucy had performed well, yet she was being twisted into a negative image.

Every time he tried to defend her, Lily would "coincidentally" appear to smooth things over, whispering, "Don’t get too close to Lucy, or the fans will attack her."

Like a puppet, he obeyed.

Richard, sensing he wanted Lucy to quit the industry, forced her to leave after the first episode.

He vaguely suspected Richard was up to something, but Lily’s affairs always distracted him.

After leaving the show, Lucy grew distant and withdrawn.

He reached out, only to be rejected. Frustrated and worried, he kept pushing until she finally softened.

One day, Lucy suddenly asked, "What would you do if I left the industry?"

His heart leapt—but he replied coldly, "Do what you want." He even added, "You insisted on following me into this world. Now you want to quit? You should’ve listened to me from the start."

He regretted it immediately.

Seeing her pale face, his chest ached—but his stubborn pride kept him from apologizing.

He dragged her out to eat, promising to take her shopping. Then Richard called—Lily had been injured on set.

Richard claimed he was too busy and asked Michael to go to the hospital.

Lily was now Richard’s client. Something felt fishy, but that voice returned: Go to Lily!

In the end, he muttered "Sorry" to Lucy and rushed off.
###Chapter 233: Michael Johnson's Past Life Epilogue (Final)

The sharp scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the hospital air.

Michael Johnson sat in the patient room, his eyes repeatedly darting to his phone. Lily Green was murmuring words of gratitude in her soft voice, but none registered in his mind.

"Michael, you're so good to me," Lily suddenly reached for his sleeve.

He instinctively recoiled, an inexplicable irritation rising in his chest. Strangely, though he wanted to outright reject her, the word that left his lips was: "Yeah."

The moment he spoke, it felt like something had taken control of him.

Leaving the hospital, he texted Lucy White.

After an eternity of waiting, only a terse "Okay" came in reply.

Richard Brown called unexpectedly about an international commercial shoot. He meant to decline, yet found himself agreeing.

Before takeoff, he stared at his phone screen. Lucy's profile picture remained unchanged.

During the overseas shoot, signals came and went.

Each video call showed Lucy looking increasingly exhausted.

"Is something wrong?" he pressed for the third time.

Lucy merely shook her head. "Just tired from filming."

Lily somehow kept appearing on set, always conveniently interrupting their calls.

More disturbingly, every attempt to check on Lucy's situation met with inexplicable obstacles—his laptop crashing, assistants calling in sick, network failures.

Upon returning, he went straight to the apartment.

His heart seized when he opened the door.

Lucy had become gaunt, dark circles like bruises under her eyes.

"What's really going on?" He grabbed her shoulders.

She pulled away, her unfamiliar gaze chilling him to the bone.

"Let's break up," she said.

The words stabbed through his heart like knives.

He stormed out, slamming the door, only to regret it in the elevator.

When he returned, the apartment stood empty.

Richard handed him a stack of documents. "Miss White has been receiving severe online harassment."

His hands trembled flipping through the vicious comments.

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Richard looked uncomfortable. "Miss White forbade it."

That night, he dreamed of Lucy standing on a rooftop's edge, smiling back at him.

He woke to a soaked pillow.

An unexpected offer came for an international blockbuster. The director insisted on shooting in a no-signal zone.

Before departure, he sent Lucy 99 messages.

None were marked as read.

Mid-shoot, Lily suddenly visited the set.

Paparazzi photos went viral overnight.

#MichaelAndLilyConfirmed trended explosively.

He immediately ordered Richard to issue a denial.

But no statement appeared.

"Book me a flight home now," he told his assistant.

Then the inexplicable happened.

Three booked flights, three cancellations.

On the fourth attempt, weather forced the plane to turn back.

At the airport, Richard met him with hesitation.

"Where's Lucy?" Michael demanded.

Richard stammered, "Miss White recently—"

A call interrupted. Lily had fallen down stairs and was in emergency surgery.

He should have gone straight to Lucy.

Yet his legs carried him to the parking lot against his will.

"To the hospital," he heard himself say.

In the hospital room, Lily wept dramatically.

After drinking some water, he suddenly passed out.

He woke to daylight.

One missed call—from Lucy.

The callback met only endless ringing.

A tidal wave of dread crashed over him.

He rushed to the apartment, finding every room hollow.

His mother's call came then.

"Lucy jumped," her voice glacial.

Under the morgue's white sheet lay the person who'd loved him most in this world.

His mother threw documents at him, each page condemning his failures—Richard's betrayal, Lily's schemes, the cruelty of cyberbullying.

The most agonizing revelation: Lucy's desperate texts for help, all intercepted.

At the funeral, he was barred from entering.

Aunt Grace's eyes branded him a murderer.

"You'll never deserve to see her again."

He embarked on a rampage of vengeance.

He watched coldly as Richard jumped to his death.

Lily proved harder to destroy.

Approaching her made his skull feel split open.

He carved Lucy's name into his arm, using pain to stay lucid.

The forces behind Lily ran deeper than imagined.

When he finally seized control of the Johnson empire, news broke of several elite families collapsing overnight.

Headlines announced Lily's car accident.

Finding her in the slums, all former glamour gone:

"Michael, save me..." Lily extended rotting hands.

He walked away to her shrieking curses.

The satisfaction of revenge evaporated instantly.

Without Lucy, the world lost all color.

One dawn, he stood on the rooftop where Lucy had jumped.

The wind howled like her fingers brushing his cheek.

Leaping, he smiled.

Finally, he could find her.

Eyes opening, his pillow was damp.

Sunlight streamed through the window as if nothing had changed.

But the agony in his chest confirmed—

That was no dream.
###Chapter 234: A Sudden Awakening

Michael Johnson jolted upright in bed, his forehead damp with cold sweat.

The dream had felt too real—so vivid that he couldn’t distinguish reality from illusion.

His hands trembled as he fumbled for his phone, his finger hovering over Lucy White’s contact. But he couldn’t bring himself to call.

"Has she... experienced this too?"

The thought took root in his mind, spreading like wildfire.

Staggering into the bathroom, he splashed icy water on his face, but it did nothing to extinguish the searing pain in his chest.

In the wine cellar, Michael uncorked a bottle of the strongest whiskey.

"Dad, come down and have a drink with me," he rasped, his voice raw.

Edward Johnson descended in his robe to find his son slumped at the bar, eyes bloodshot.

"What’s wrong?" Edward frowned. "Is this about Lucy again?"

Michael threw back a shot, his throat working. "I dreamed... I drove her to her death."

The glass hit the counter with a sharp crack.

Edward’s heart lurched. "Don’t talk nonsense!"

"It’s not nonsense." Michael’s laugh was hollow. "I kept hurting her for someone else’s sake, and in the end, she... jumped from the twenty-eighth floor."

His fingers dug into the glass, knuckles white.

After a long silence, Edward sighed. "If you regret it now, it’s not too late."

"It is." Michael’s voice shook. "If that dream was real... she’ll never forgive me in this lifetime."

The whiskey swirled in his glass, distorting his reflection—just like his shattered heart.

Edward studied his son, reminded of his own past. "Your mother never truly forgave me either."

"But at least... you still get to stay by her side." Michael’s eyes burned. "I don’t even have that right anymore."

Suddenly, he buried his face in his hands, shoulders heaving.

Tears seeped through his fingers, splattering onto the marble counter.

Edward had never seen his son so broken. He hesitated, unsure how to respond.

"I’ve made a decision." Michael lifted his head, his gaze resolute. "I’m leaving the industry."

"What?" Edward was stunned. "But you’ve always—"

"It’s meaningless now." Michael cut him off. "In this world, I couldn’t protect her."

The image of Lucy, bloodied and lifeless in his dream, pierced his heart like a blade.

"I’ll take over the family business," he said quietly. "This time, I won’t let her suffer again."

Even if... it meant watching from afar.

Edward considered him thoughtfully. "You’ve really thought this through?"

"I have." Michael drained the last of his whiskey, the glass reflecting his red-rimmed eyes. "Some mistakes... can never be undone."

Like the irreversible sin he’d committed in that dream.
###Chapter 235: A Warning Shot

Edward Johnson sighed deeply. Love could be the most tormenting thing in the world.

"When do you plan to retire from the industry?" he asked.

What else could he do? His son would always have his unconditional support.

Michael Johnson pressed his lips together. "I’ll cancel all my upcoming schedules soon and start familiarizing myself with the company’s operations."

"After finishing my last contracted film, I’ll officially announce my retirement."

He hadn’t even had the chance to share the screen with Lucy yet. Since he’d entered the entertainment world, he at least wanted to leave behind a memento.

Edward nodded approvingly. "Good. Take a couple of days to adjust, then report to the company."

The rare heart-to-heart conversation had brought father and son closer.

When Rachel Johnson came downstairs, she found them still talking.

"What’s going on here?" she asked curiously.

Edward chuckled. "This kid had a nightmare and woke me up in the middle of the night for drinks and a chat."

Thankfully, he’d been working late in his study—otherwise, his wife would’ve been disturbed too.

Rachel took a closer look and gasped. Her son’s eyes were swollen like walnuts.

She froze. In all his years, this was the first time she’d seen him cry so hard.

"What kind of nightmare was it? You never even cried as a child," she teased, though her tone softened. "You look awful."

The light jab actually eased Michael’s tension.

"I dreamed Lucy jumped off a building," he murmured.

Rachel’s face paled. "Nonsense!"

She quickly clasped her hands together. "Dreams are the opposite of reality. Lucy will be just fine."

Michael forced a smile. "Right. She will be fine."

"Mom," he suddenly said, "didn’t you want to make Lucy your goddaughter? Don’t wait until next year—do it soon."

Rachel stared at him as if he’d grown a second head. "You were dead set against it before."

She reached out to feel his forehead. "No fever?"

As much as she was frustrated with her son’s past behavior, seeing him like this still tugged at her heart.

Michael shook his head. "I’ve thought it through."

"That dream was terrifying. I’m afraid... afraid something might happen to her if she stays with me."

The words cut through him like a knife.

Rachel sighed. She could tell Lucy had truly moved on.

Just like how she herself had once given up on Edward, some wounds never fully healed.

"It’s good that you understand now," she said, patting his shoulder. "Lucy deserves better."

Michael bit his lip hard. "Yeah."

Rachel hugged him. "What matters is that you’ve learned."

He returned the embrace. In his dream, after Lucy’s death, his mother’s hair had turned white overnight.

This time, he wouldn’t let tragedy repeat itself.

"Be a good brother from now on," Rachel said gently.

"Okay," he rasped, his heart shattering.

Meanwhile...

Last night, Lucy had hacked into the Gould and Von family systems and uncovered plenty of illegal evidence.

Just as she was about to log off, she noticed someone had launched a targeted attack on Gould Group’s stocks.

Tracing the IP address led her straight to her own home.

The next morning...

The aroma of breakfast filled the kitchen as Lucy walked in and saw her mother wrapping dumplings.

"Morning, Mom. You’re up early," she said with a smile.

Grace White looked at her daughter warmly. "Cooking for you two is my joy."

Casually, Lucy asked, "Mom, did you manipulate Gould Group’s stocks last night?"

Grace didn’t even turn around. "Yes, I did."

Lucy’s eyes lit up. "You know how to play the stock market?"

"I used to be a trader," Grace replied calmly. "Then I decided I had enough money to live comfortably."

When she first ran away from home, she’d started with just a few hundred dollars and slowly built her fortune.

It wasn’t until she met Lucy’s father that she finally settled into a peaceful life.

But now that the Gould women had gone too far, it was time to teach them a lesson.
###Chapter 236: She's No Fool

Lucy's hand holding the teacup paused slightly, causing tiny ripples in the amber liquid.

"Mom, aside from being a stock trader, you actually know international mercenaries?" Her bright eyes sparkled with poorly concealed curiosity.

Grace took a delicate sip, her lips curving in a faint smile. "Yes, I'm acquainted with one of their headquarters' executives. We're on good terms."

"Your father knows them too," she added, her gaze drifting toward the window as if recalling distant memories.

Lucy leaned closer, wrapping her arms around her mother's in an affectionate gesture. "You and Dad have been keeping so many secrets from us!"

Grace pinched her daughter's cheek playfully. "Just old stories. Nothing worth mentioning."

"Then what exactly did you two do before?" Lucy pressed.

"Your father mainly studied metaphysics—you know that." Grace set down her cup. "After having you children, I focused on gardening."

She lowered her voice slightly. "Though we did join the International High-IQ Society. Met quite a few interesting people."

"International High-IQ Society?" Lucy's eyes widened.

"A rather discreet organization," Grace confirmed. "Your father was one of the founding members. I was invited later."

Lucy's face lit up. "Mom, you must have been an incredible trader!"

Grace chuckled. "I ranked first once. Mostly stayed within the top five afterward."

A nostalgic gleam flickered in her eyes. "But after marriage, I gradually stepped back."

"You're amazing, Mom!" Lucy breathed in genuine admiration.

"Want to learn?" Grace asked warmly.

Lucy shook her head. "Numbers aren't my thing. Noah would be perfect for it, though."

"I'll ask him sometime," Grace agreed.

Noah seemed much better today, having gone to paint in the study after breakfast.

When Lucy arrived on set, Lily was late—again.

Director Jude's expression darkened, but he couldn't be bothered to reprimand her anymore.

That afternoon, Lucy brought cold drinks and desserts for the crew as thanks.

Lily watched coldly from the sidelines. When the crowd dispersed, she marched straight to Lucy.

"You orchestrated that online mess, didn't you?" she hissed.

Lucy took a leisurely sip of lemon water. "What mess?"

"Buying trolls to hype me up just to tear me down!" Lily gnashed her teeth.

Lucy glanced at Lily's pocket and smirked. "You? Worth my money?"

"Know your place." She stood. "Focus on acting instead of pointless schemes."

Without another glance, Lucy walked off set.

Returning home, she found Rachel having tea with Grace.

"Aunt Rachel," Lucy greeted sweetly.

Rachel beckoned with a smile. "Come here, dear. You can call me godmother from now on."

Grace explained, "Your godmother wants to formally adopt you. I agreed."

Lucy's face brightened. "That's wonderful! I've always seen you as family."

Rachel looked touched. "Tomorrow, our families will have dinner together for a small ceremony."

Grace suddenly asked, "Did Michael agree?"

Rachel's expression turned peculiar. "He had a dream last night and suddenly consented this morning."

Lucy's pulse jumped. "What dream?"

"He said he saw you..." Rachel hesitated. "Jumping off a building. Woke up in tears."

Lucy forced calm into her voice. "Dreams are the opposite of reality."

She turned to pour water, her fingers trembling imperceptibly.

How could Michael have dreamed about her past life?
###Chapter 237: Awakening

As soon as Lucy White finished removing her makeup after wrapping up filming, her phone rang. It was Rachel Johnson.

"Lucy, Michael said he's picking you up. Come straight home for dinner," Rachel's gentle voice carried a hint of excitement. "Today's a special day."

Lucy agreed and hung up, her fingers trembling slightly. She took a deep breath and pushed open the dressing room door.

Under the sunset, Michael Johnson leaned against his car, smoking. The moment he saw her, he crushed the cigarette and swiftly opened the passenger door for her.

"Waiting long?" Lucy slid into the seat, catching a faint citrus scent in the car—unfamiliar, not his usual cologne.

Michael paused while fastening his seatbelt. "Just got here." His sharp profile looked even more defined in the twilight, though the redness at the corners of his eyes betrayed exhaustion.

As the engine started, Lucy suddenly grabbed his wrist.

"You didn’t sleep last night?"

His pulse thrummed violently under her fingers. He pulled his hand back in silence, gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white.

"Had a nightmare," he rasped, his voice raw. "You jumped from the 38th floor."

The air in the car froze.

Lucy’s pupils contracted. She knew that scene too well—in their past life, Michael had stood behind the floor-to-ceiling windows of the opposite building when she fell.

"And then?" Her voice was eerily calm.

Michael slammed on the brakes. Tires screeched against asphalt as he turned to face her.

"Then I realized it wasn’t a dream." His Adam’s apple bobbed. "It was our past life, wasn’t it?"

The last sliver of sunlight glinted off the redness in his eyes. Lucy suddenly noticed a fresh scar on his left ring finger—as if a wedding band had been violently torn away.

Her heart skipped a beat. The wound matched exactly where he’d ripped off his ring when she jumped in their past life.

"You remember everything?" she whispered.

Michael abruptly undid the top button of his shirt. A jagged scar marred his collarbone—identical to the injury he’d gotten saving her on set in their past life.

"Not just memories." He gave a bitter smile. "Even the scars came back."

Her fingers turned cold. She should’ve noticed sooner—three days ago, when he suddenly canceled all his schedules, when his gaze held something desperate whenever he looked at her.

"So now…" Her voice shook. "You’re here to atone?"

Michael leaned in suddenly, his tobacco-tinged breath brushing her ear. Lucy instinctively recoiled—only to hear a soft click as he buckled her seatbelt.

"I’m here to rewrite the ending." He restarted the car, his voice barely audible. "This time, I’ll be the one chasing you."

The radio abruptly played Rebirth. The melody made them both freeze—it was the song they’d fallen in love to in their past life.

At the red light, Michael turned to her. "Do you believe in fate?"

Lucy watched the endless stream of cars outside. In their past life, she’d seen Michael’s car speeding through this very intersection—with Lily Green in the passenger seat.

"I do." A slow smile curved her lips. "But I believe in making my own fate more."

When the light turned green, Michael abruptly U-turned—not toward the Johnson residence, but toward the winding mountain roads outside the city.

"Where are we going?" Lucy clutched the seatbelt.

"To see the stars." He pressed the accelerator. "A date I owed you last time."

Wind roared through the open windows. Lucy suddenly remembered being eighteen, when Michael had driven her like this to skip class and watch a meteor shower. Back then, he’d still called her "Lemon Drop."

"Michael Johnson." She used his full name. "If we could start over—"

"No if." He cut her off, voice firm. "This time, I choose you. Only you."

The mountaintop stars burned as bright as ever. Michael retrieved two beers from the trunk, the tabs cracking open with crisp sounds.

"To a new life." He raised his can.

Lucy didn’t take hers. Gazing at the city lights in the distance, she murmured, "Do you know what I regret most?"

Michael’s hand hovered midair.

"Not letting go sooner." She turned to him, starlight reflecting in her eyes. "So we should—"

"Too late." He suddenly upended the beer over his head, icy liquid dripping down his jaw. "The moment we woke up in this life, I signed a blood oath."

He yanked his collar aside, revealing a crimson sigil over his heart. Lucy gasped—it was the most ruthless soul-binding curse in metaphysics, tethering the caster eternally to their target.

"Are you insane?" Her voice trembled. "This curse can’t be broken!"

Michael laughed, tears glinting at his lashes. "Perfect. Now you can’t get rid of me this lifetime."

The night wind lifted his shirt, revealing a half-healed knife wound on his lower back—precisely where he’d taken a blade for her before.

Fate was a closed loop, and neither of them could escape.
###Chapter 238: From Now On, You're My Sister

Michael Johnson wasn't the mastermind behind Lucy White's death, but he was far from blameless.

Yet she no longer hated him.

Especially after learning that he had later jumped to his own death—that the phone call she'd overheard wasn't him cheating with Lily Green, but a setup.

She had finally let go.

But the love between them had long since withered. She remained distant, never bothering to reach out.

They could still interact, but the childhood intimacy they once shared was gone forever.

Some things, once lost, could never be reclaimed.

"The ending in your dream proves we were never meant to be," she murmured with a sigh.

Had they not been trapped in that novel's world, without Lily's interference or the constraints of fate—

Perhaps they might have had a happy ending.

But there were no "what ifs" in this life...

Michael's heart ached, but he forced a smile. "Yeah. We missed our chance."

Lucy had died because of him. In this lifetime, he didn't dare hope for more.

He stubbed out his cigarette, took a deep breath, and ruffled her hair like he used to when they were kids.

"From now on, you're my sister." The words came out strained, but he finally said them.

Lucy looked up, meeting his weary, pained—yet resolute—gaze. Her eyes reddened instantly.

She tugged at his sleeve, just like she had as a child, and whispered, "Michael."

Maybe that single word sealed their fate—brother and sister, nothing more.

His eyes grew damp too. "If anyone bullies you, I'll take care of it."

Lucy smiled. "Okay."

It was over. From now on, he would be her brother.

"What happened after I died? How are Mom and Noah?" Her family was still her greatest concern.

Michael recounted everything, stopping only when he reached the timeline of his own suicide. "After that... I don't know."

Hearing that Noah had nearly died from grief and that Grace had aged overnight shattered Lucy's heart.

But one detail stunned her. "You mean... Dad came back? And he avenged me?"

"Yeah." Michael nodded. "Those families went bankrupt within a year. Liam Parker and the others either died or were left crippled—none of them got off easy."

"Lily Green was disfigured in a car accident. She's wheelchair-bound now. No happy ending for her."

Lucy couldn't believe it. Lily was the novel's heroine, and those men were the male leads. How had her father dismantled them so easily?

Was he another "Chosen One"?

Or had her death shattered the world's rules?

"What did Dad look like when he returned? Do you know where he'd been all these years?"

Michael shook his head. "No idea. He just showed up out of nowhere after hearing about your death and started his revenge."

"All I know is he seemed to have been in some kind of trouble before. That's why he couldn't come back sooner."

"But things are different now. You and your father will reunite."

In the dream, Lucy's father had glared at him like he wanted to kill him.

If Grace hadn't intervened, the man might have taken him out too.

After that, neither Grace nor his own mother would see him, so he knew little about Lucy's father.

But one thing was certain—the man was terrifyingly powerful. Crushing those families had been as easy as stepping on ants.

Disappointed by the lack of answers, Lucy still felt a wave of relief.

Her father was alive. He would come back.

"That's all that matters."

Michael agreed. "You'll see him again."

They sat in silence a while longer before Michael finally started the car and drove them home.

By the time they reached the Johnson residence, both had composed themselves.

Rachel Johnson and Grace White were relieved to see them laughing together.

Only Edward Johnson sighed to himself.

His son had truly lost the girl he loved.

He held Rachel closer, grateful she had returned.

Dinner was a feast prepared by Rachel and Grace.

As they sat down, Rachel poured wine for everyone and handed Lucy a wooden box.

"Lucy, from now on, you're my daughter. This is your godmother's gift."

Inside was a set of heirloom jewelry.

Lucy accepted it with a smile. "Thank you, Godmother."

The two families enjoyed the meal, chatting over tea until Lucy and her family said their goodbyes.

Michael offered to drive them home, and this time, Lucy didn't refuse.

Though they weren't as close as before, the tension between them had dissolved. They truly felt like siblings now.

In the following days, Lucy focused on filming. Director Jude Miller pushed the crew hard to stay on schedule, and Lily caused no further trouble.

The team relocated to another province for outdoor shoots, staying over half a month. Ethan Smith, Michael, and Julian Chase all visited the set.

Ian Stone didn't come because of Lily's presence but kept in touch with Lucy through messages.

After wrapping the first season, Director Jude gave everyone a break back in the capital.

Though called a "season," it was only twelve episodes. Post-production would be rushed.

Jude planned to release these twelve as a test. If reception was good, they'd continue. If mediocre, they'd take their time. If it flopped, they'd scrap the project entirely.

This was standard for web dramas—better to cut losses early than waste resources on a full season no one wanted.

After filming, Jude felt confident. The plot was tight, the sets and costumes exquisite, and the post-production team top-tier.

The female lead might draw criticism, but everything else was flawless.

The assistant director argued that controversy meant attention—as long as the show itself wasn't panned, the buzz would help.

So Jude remained hopeful. If even this failed, he'd swear off web dramas for good.

The entire crew shared his optimism.
###Chapter 239: Blinding Radiance

Lucy White returned to the capital just in time for the Wilde Group's annual charity auction.

Hunter Wilde personally delivered the gilded invitation to her, adding with a meaningful smile, "There are several rare treasures up for bidding—ones I think you'll find particularly intriguing."

On the day of the event, Ethan Smith rushed back from his western film set, driving straight to pick Lucy up in his sleek sedan. Their destination: the exclusive Hexagon Club in the suburbs.

Uniformed attendants opened their car doors with practiced grace. As Lucy handed over her invitation, she caught the flicker of surprise in the doorman's eyes.

The penthouse ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers, filled with socialites clinking champagne flutes. Lucy entered on Ethan's arm, her ice-blue cheongsam embroidered with delicate silver motifs catching the light. The dress was part of a matching set Vanessa Knight had commissioned—ice blue, buttercup yellow, and crimson—for their trio's coordinated debut tonight.

"Is that... Lucy White?" Several starlets accompanying wealthy patrons exchanged startled glances. When they witnessed the club manager's warm greeting to Ethan and unusually deferential attitude toward Lucy, whispers rippled through the crowd like wildfire.

In a shadowed corner, the Gould and Von families observed the scene with icy disdain. Fiona Von's knuckles whitened around her champagne flute. "How dare she show her face here?"

"Just another gold-digging actress clinging to the Smith heir," Giselle Gould sneered, nostrils flaring. "Watch how quickly she falls when her sugar daddy tires of her."

Frederick Von's gaze lingered on Lucy's profile—so eerily reminiscent of Grace White's—until his daughter yanked his sleeve. "Father! Why are you staring at that nobody?"

Across the room, Hugo Wilde moved to greet Lucy and Ethan, their easy camaraderie drawing envious stares. Giselle's eyes burned with venom. "That little tramp's wormed her way into the Wilde family now?"

"Enough!" Frederick snapped. "Remember your station."

Near the champagne tower, Oliver Knight circulated with Lily Green on his arm. When Vanessa entered laughing with a handsome companion, his glass jerked violently.

Lily noted his reaction. "You know her?"

"Not really," Oliver ground out, though his gaze tracked the crimson-clad figure like a compass needle. The sight of Vanessa whispering intimately with her escort sent an irrational spike of irritation through him.

Lucy turned as if sensing something, meeting Giselle's poisonous glare head-on. A faint smile curved her lips as she flicked her fingers subtly. A wisp of shadow detached itself, vanishing into Giselle's designer gown unnoticed.

"See something interesting?" Ethan murmured.

Lucy swirled her champagne, the ice-blue silk shimmering like moonlit water. "Just watching... prey walk willingly into the trap."
###Chapter 240: Who Doesn't Love a Puppy Boy?

Vanessa Knight had barely stepped into the grand ballroom on Simon Chase's arm when her gaze was drawn to the couple in the corner.

Lucy White lounged gracefully against a sofa in her champagne-colored gown, while Ethan Smith stood beside her in a black suit that accentuated his broad shoulders and long legs. Though merely standing casually, they commanded attention like a spotlight, drawing frequent glances from nearby guests.

"Lucy!" Vanessa tugged Simon forward, the slit of her cheongsam revealing glimpses of porcelain skin that made Simon's Adam's apple bob.

Lucy turned with a start, her eyes lighting up. "Vanessa, you're breaking beauty regulations tonight." She reached out to tuck a stray lock behind Vanessa's ear. "This cheongsam was made for you."

Vanessa's eyes crinkled with delight. "Coming from the legendary Lucy White, I'll be smiling in my sleep tonight." She winked mischievously. "I should've pursued you back in the day."

"It's never too late," Lucy quipped with a raised brow.

The women dissolved into laughter, oblivious to the darkening expressions of their male companions.

Simon cleared his throat subtly, pulling Vanessa closer. "Darling, aren't you going to introduce us?"

"Oh right!" Vanessa brightened. "Lucy, meet my puppy boy Simon Chase." Turning to Simon, she added, "This is my best friend Lucy White I'm always telling you about."

Simon's gaze flickered between Lucy and Ethan before breaking into a grin. "Uncle Ethan."

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "When did you return?"

"Last week." Simon squeezed Vanessa's hand. "Heard someone was single again and booked the first flight."

Vanessa's ears turned pink as she shot him a glare. Ethan observed their joined hands with amusement. "Your sister-in-law was just asking if you'd gone extreme sports diving again."

Simon immediately raised his hands in surrender. "Don't rat me out, Uncle. I've been coming home like clockwork."

Lucy muffled a laugh, whispering to Vanessa, "Keeping him on a short leash?"

Vanessa lifted her chin proudly. "Of course. My puppy boy's very well-trained."

Their banter was interrupted as Oliver Knight approached with Lily Green in tow. His jaw tightened visibly at the sight of Simon's arm around Vanessa's waist.

"Vanessa, who's this?" Oliver forced a smile.

"My boyfriend, Simon Chase," Vanessa replied, her smile cooling.

Simon extended a hand with polite mockery. "Mr. Knight, I've heard so much."

Oliver eyed Simon's casual blazer disdainfully. "What do you do, Mr. Chase?"

"Just returned to start an entertainment company for fun." Simon's tone remained easy. "My brother Sebastian Chase—you might know him?"

Oliver stiffened. The Chase Group heir had recently made the billionaire list. Only then did he notice the limited edition Patek Philippe on Simon's wrist, the realization sticking in his throat like a fishbone.

Lily interjected sweetly, "Vanessa, you look stunning tonight." Her gaze lingered on Simon. "Your new boyfriend seems... quite young."

Vanessa's red lips curved. "Young stamina is the best stamina—and so affectionate." She deliberately swayed Simon's arm. "Beats some tired old men, don't you think?"

Simon obliged by murmuring something that made Vanessa laugh brightly. Oliver turned ashen, hastily dragging Lily away.

Watching their retreat, Lucy swirled her champagne. "Puppy boys definitely outclass scumbags."

Ethan suddenly leaned close, his breath warm against her ear. "I'm five years older than him. Are you calling me old, Lucy?"

Before Lucy could respond, Hunter Wilde's group approached with drinks. David Wilson plopped onto the sofa. "What's the fun about?"

Evan York spotted Oliver's glare from across the room and whistled. "Someone's jealousy is showing."

In response, Simon pulled Vanessa into a quick kiss. "Let him stew."

Vanessa flushed, swatting his chest. "You're impossible!"

Amid the laughter, no one noticed the icy stare watching them from the ballroom's second floor balcony...
###Chapter 241: Dangerous Thoughts

Simon Chase knew Oliver Knight inside out.

After years of rivalry over the same woman, he'd even investigated what brand of underwear the man preferred.

When news broke that Vanessa Knight had finally called off her engagement to this scumbag, Simon immediately flew back from abroad.

To his surprise, his goddess actually accepted his long-standing courtship.

Now that he'd won her heart, it was only natural to exact revenge on her behalf.

He planned to establish an entertainment company solely to poach Oliver's business.

Of course, Oliver recognized the Chase name.

Sebastian Chase was a legend in the capital's business circles, having broken into the top ten wealthiest individuals before turning thirty-five.

More terrifyingly, the Chase family's influence ran unfathomably deep.

Never in his wildest dreams had Oliver imagined this pretty-faced rival would turn out to be Sebastian's younger brother.

Oliver's complexion turned ashen.

After he'd dumped Vanessa, she'd actually climbed her way into the Chase family?

What stung most was realizing Simon was several years Vanessa's junior.

Forcing a smile, Oliver managed, "So it's young master Chase. I've heard much about you."

Simon's grin turned razor-sharp. "Actually, I should thank you, Mr. Knight. Had you not let go, I'd never have gotten together with Vanessa."

"I've pursued her for twelve years straight. We're getting married this winter."

"You simply must attend our wedding banquet."

He knew exactly how to twist the knife.

The more Oliver suffered, the happier he'd be.

Serves the bastard right for not appreciating Vanessa's worth.

He'd already informed his family—in a few days, he'd formally propose at the Knight residence.

Vanessa barely suppressed an eye roll.

When had she agreed to a winter wedding?

Still, she'd play along to bolster her boyfriend's ego in front of this trash.

Her lips curved into a dazzling smile. "Yes, Oliver, you really must come."

That radiant expression pierced Oliver's eyes like shards of glass.

They were marrying so soon?

An inexplicable sense of loss flooded his chest.

His strained smile remained. "Certainly."

Logically, he should be relieved—Vanessa would finally stop pestering him.

Then why did his heart ache so violently?

Simon had no patience for further pleasantries. "We'll leave you to your guests, Mr. Knight."

Oliver nodded mechanically. "Of course."

Watching Vanessa's retreating figure, a dark thought suddenly surfaced.

If only he'd...

Lily Green clung to Oliver's arm, her smile brittle.

She'd never expected Vanessa—that aging has-been—to land such an exceptional man after being discarded.

Life wasn't fair.

Seeing Oliver stare after Vanessa triggered alarm bells.

"Oliver, my feet hurt," she whined. "Let's sit down."

Oliver snapped back to reality. "Fine."

Her delicate act used to charm him. Now it grated on his nerves.

Elsewhere, Hunter Wilde got summoned by his brother for networking.

Fiona Von and Felix Von finally noticed the resemblance between the brothers.

Recalling their names, Fiona's pulse quickened.

No wonder Hunter's background proved untraceable—he was a Wilde.

She warned her brother in hushed tones: "Stay away from Hunter from now on."

Though spoiled, Felix wasn't stupid.

The Wilde family operated on a level far beyond their reach.

Still, he muttered defiantly, "As long as he leaves me alone, I won't bother him."

Fiona rolled her eyes. "Even if he provokes you, swallow your pride."

"Why should I?" Felix bristled. "The Von and Gould families aren't pushovers."

Her idiot brother might actually give her an aneurysm.

The Wildes could crush their family like ants.

"Still angling for your inheritance?" she hissed. "Gould Group's stock crash already cost us millions."

"One more scandal, and grandfather might replace you as heir."

Recent Gould misfortunes had torpedoed multiple major projects.

Working at Gould Corporation now, Fiona barely kept her head above water.

Felix's expression darkened.

The patriarch had been furious over the failed ventures lately.

Another screw-up could...

"Fine, I'll behave," he conceded grudgingly.

Fiona nodded approvingly. "Now go apologize to Hunter for injuring his arm last time."

"What?" Felix exploded. "Apologize to him? Never!"

He stormed off before she could respond.

No way would he humiliate himself publicly.

Fiona stamped her foot in frustration.

That useless brat!

But she wouldn't waste this opportunity.

Her inquiries confirmed Hunter's identity.

Hugo Wilde had brought his brother specifically to introduce him to their social circle.

The youngest Wilde—the family's most pampered prince.

This status instantly elevated Hunter in everyone's eyes.

Fiona freshened her makeup. Spotting Hunter alone, she immediately approached.
###Chapter 242: So Unfair

Hunter Wilde had just shaken off his elder brother's pestering and was about to find Ethan Smith and Lucy White when a heavily made-up woman blocked his path.

"Can I help you?" He frowned at the woman before him.

Fiona Von flipped her curled hair with practiced elegance. "Hello, Hunter. I'm Felix Von's sister."

She flashed a meticulously rehearsed smile. "I heard my brother offended you earlier. I came to apologize personally."

She deliberately softened her voice, convinced Hunter would be drawn to demure, refined women.

Little did she know, her affected mannerisms made him nauseous.

"If you know your brother has no manners, you should keep him locked up at home for proper discipline." Hunter didn't mince words. "With a sister like you, no wonder he turned out so poorly."

With that, he turned on his heel, unwilling to waste another second on her.

Fiona stomped her foot in frustration. Was this man blind? How could he humiliate her when she, a stunning beauty, was offering herself to him?

Hunter plopped down beside Lucy and groaned, "Just ran into some crazy woman putting on airs. Disgusting."

He'd become an expert at spotting fakes. After being harassed by that deranged woman before, he could instantly identify any sanctimonious schemer.

Lucy stifled a laugh. "Your luck with admirers is truly one-of-a-kind."

She'd long seen through Fiona's true nature. First stealing her best friend's boyfriend, now trying to climb the social ladder? She and Lily Green were cut from the same cloth.

Hunter sighed dramatically. "What's wrong with me? Why do I only attract toxic romance?"

"Lucy, this isn't another romantic doom situation, is it?" he asked warily.

She shook her head with a smile. "Relax. Just an ordinary rotten flower. Ignore it, and it'll wither."

"Thank goodness!" Hunter exhaled in relief.

Just then, a smooth male voice came from behind them. "Lucy, what a coincidence."

Julian Chase stood there gracefully, his gaze fixed intently on Lucy.

"Mr. Chase." Lucy nodded politely.

Julian sat down uninvited. "Had I known you'd be here, I would've asked you to be my plus-one."

"I'm more interested in the auction," she replied courteously.

"You could've gotten an invitation from me," Julian offered eagerly.

Hunter immediately cut in protectively, "My brother's hosting this auction. Why would she need your invite? Lucy's not stupid."

He shot Ethan a look: See? Someone's trying to move in!

Ethan returned a calm glance: Just a clown seeking attention.

Julian raised an eyebrow. "Hunter, since when did you become so nosy?"

"Better than being fake," Hunter retorted bluntly. "Lucy, this guy's a notorious playboy. Stay away."

Julian: "..." He suddenly regretted approaching them.

"I change my outfit daily, but that doesn't mean I change women just as often," he defended with forced cheer.

Ethan delivered the finishing blow: "Everyone knows Julian Chase's romantic escapades."

Lucy watched their bickering with amusement.

Nearby, Lily Green and Fiona Von burned with jealousy. How could Lucy so effortlessly belong in that elite circle while they couldn't get close no matter how hard they tried?

So unfair!

As the auction was about to begin, guests started filing out. Lucy's group took their time leaving last.

At the entrance, they ran into the Gould family.

Giselle Gould's eyes gleamed as she raised her voice pointedly: "Isn't this Lucy? Aren't you going to greet your grandfather?"

She counted on Lucy's fiery temper to publicly snub the old man—humiliating him while ruining Lucy's image in front of these influential young men.

A perfect two-for-one scheme played out in her scheming mind.
###Chapter 243: Tit for Tat

Having spent years navigating the treacherous waters of the entertainment industry in her past life, Lucy White had seen all kinds of scheming and deceit.

Giselle Gould's petty schemes were transparent to her at a glance.

Since the woman had come looking for trouble, Lucy wasn’t about to hold back.

"Excuse me, ma'am, do I know you?" Lucy tilted her head, feigning confusion.

Giselle forced a saccharine smile. "I'm your aunt—your mother's own sister."

She deliberately raised her voice. "You can deny me, but surely you won't deny your own grandfather?"

Lucy gave her a once-over before bursting into laughter. "With a face like that, you dare claim kinship?"

Her gaze shifted to Winston Gould beside her. "My grandfather passed away long ago. My mother's last name is White. What does that have to do with the Goulds?"

Winston's face darkened instantly.

"Is this the fine daughter Grace White raised?" he thundered. "Cursing your elders—such insolence!"

Lucy arched a brow disdainfully. "My mother always said she had a mother but no father to speak of. And you, old man, have the nerve to lecture me about respect?"

"No wonder Giselle and her daughter are so shameless—it runs in the family!"

Suddenly, she gasped in mock realization. "Wait... could it be that you and your daughter have some unspeakable relationship?"

"After all, Giselle had no qualms seducing another woman's fiancé. What's seducing her own stepfather compared to that?"

"I heard you two walk around arm in arm, closer than most fathers and daughters."

Lucy dramatically covered her mouth. "Oh my! Is Fiona Von your illegitimate child?"

"No wonder you're handing the Gould Group to her—she carries your blood, even if her origins are... questionable."

Her words detonated like a bomb among the onlookers.

Whispers erupted instantly, and the crowd's gazes toward the Goulds shifted with suspicion.

Winston trembled with rage. "You—you vile creature! How dare you slander your elders!"

Giselle paled. "You little bitch! How dare you spread such lies!"

Lucy smirked. "Struck a nerve, did I?"

"When you drove my mother out of the family all those years ago... was it because she discovered your dirty secret?"

She turned to the crowd, raising her voice. "Tell me, what kind of father treats his own daughter like that?"

Giselle completely lost control, lunging at Lucy with claws bared. "I'll rip your lying mouth apart!"

Before she could get close, several security guards intercepted her.

Hunter Wilde stepped forward, his expression icy. "The Goulds' despicable behavior isn't welcome here at our auction house."

"Leave. Now."

Winston swayed, his vision darkening from sheer humiliation.

Never in his life had he been so thoroughly disgraced!
###Chapter 244: This Is Serious Trouble

Hunter Wilde's eyes turned sharp as he listened to Lucy White's words.

He had never liked the Goulds or the Vons, but now his disgust reached new heights.

"Disgusting," Hunter sneered, his voice just loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.

The moment those words left his mouth, the crowd's gazes toward Giselle Gould shifted.

"I always thought it was strange how a stepfather could dote on his stepdaughter like that."

"Right? He even abandoned his own flesh and blood."

"Tsk tsk, the Von family is really..."

Whispers spread like wildfire, each one cutting into Frederick Von like a knife.

Frederick's face darkened as countless memories flooded back—

Giselle's extended visits to her parents' home.

Old Man Gould's excessive favoritism toward Fiona.

That time he accidentally saw Giselle and her stepfather in the study...

Slap!

Frederick suddenly struck himself across the face, wishing he could vanish into thin air.

"Dad!" Fiona cried, grabbing his arm in panic. "Don't listen to her lies!"

"Get off!" Frederick shoved his daughter away, his glare fixed on Giselle. "We'll settle this at home."

Giselle paled under her husband's stare. "Frederick, let me explain—"

"Explain what?" Lucy interjected with a mocking smile. "How you seduced your stepfather? Or how you hired killers?"

"You—!" Giselle trembled with rage, then suddenly felt dizzy.

Unbeknownst to her, Lucy had slipped something into her drink earlier.

"You little bitch!" Giselle's eyes burned red as she pointed at Lucy. "I should've killed you along with your mother!"

Gasps erupted through the crowd.

"She admitted it!"

"How horrifying..."

Lucy's eyes gleamed with triumph as she fanned the flames. "Hear that? She just confessed to plotting my mother's murder—and now mine."

Turning to Old Man Gould, her voice cracked with emotion: "Grandfather, this is the stepdaughter you've spoiled for twenty years!"

The old man's face drained of color, his lips trembling wordlessly.

Beatrice Gould stomped her foot in frustration. "Giselle! Control yourself!"

But Giselle was beyond reason now. "Why did Grace have to come back? She should've stayed dead!"

"And you!" She jabbed a finger at Lucy. "You both deserve to die!"

Slap!

A resounding blow echoed through the room.

To everyone's shock, Old Man Gould broke free from Beatrice's grip and struck Giselle across the face.

"You viper!" The patriarch shook with fury. "After everything I've done for you!"

Then his eyes rolled back—he collapsed unconscious.

"Grandfather!"

"Dad!"

Chaos erupted.

Lucy watched the pandemonium with cold amusement, a smirk playing on her lips.

This was only the beginning.

As Beatrice struggled to support her unconscious husband, one thought consumed her:

This is serious trouble.
###Chapter 245: The Show Has Just Begun

Old Man Gould collapsed in a fit of rage, and Lucy White’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

In her past life, this wretched man had pretended to be magnanimous while secretly plotting to hand the family business to her mother and brother. Now that his dirty secrets had been exposed in public, karma had finally caught up with him.

"Oh dear, how unfortunate," Lucy feigned surprise, covering her mouth. "I didn’t realize the old man was so… fragile."

Ethan Smith smoothly chimed in, "Well, being exposed for an affair with one’s stepdaughter would make anyone faint."

Julian Chase, rarely one to agree, added dryly, "Passing out is the only way to save face at this point."

Giselle Gould’s face twisted in fury as she struggled to lunge at Lucy. Frederick Von’s expression darkened—he had never been humiliated like this in his entire life.

"Take her home," he said coldly to Beatrice Gould. "The Von family has no use for such a disgraceful wife."

With that, he turned and walked away without so much as a backward glance.

Beatrice trembled with rage. If her son-in-law left now, wouldn’t it confirm all the rumors?

Fiona Von and her brother arrived just in time to witness the chaos.

"What happened to Grandfather?" Fiona asked, only to hear murmurs ripple through the crowd.

"Grandfather? Shouldn’t you call him Daddy?"
"Tsk, tsk. A mother and daughter sharing a man—how scandalous."

Fiona paled, while Beatrice snapped, "Get him to the hospital, now!"

The society ladies exchanged knowing glances. The Gould women, who had always acted so refined, were nothing but filth beneath their polished facades.

Lucy watched the spectacle with satisfaction. In her past life, these very people had reveled in her downfall. Now, it was their turn to taste the bitterness of public scorn—and this was only the beginning.

"The auction is about to start," she murmured.

Ethan nodded in understanding. "Don’t let the trash ruin your mood."

As they descended, the banquet hall buzzed with gossip. The Gould scandal had spread like wildfire.

"Did you hear? Old Man Gould and his stepdaughter—"
"I always knew those two were rotten!"

The auctioneer’s gavel struck, gradually restoring order. Lucy ran her fingers over her bidding paddle, her mood unusually light.

She had already instructed her mother to prepare the "evidence"—those incriminating photos taken by private investigators years ago. Once those circulated, Old Man Gould would never show his face in high society again.

"Next up, Lot 38: a millennium-old red coral..."

Without hesitation, Lucy raised her paddle. Her mother had given her more than enough funds—she would secure this rare treasure to strengthen her brother’s constitution.

As for the Goulds?

The show had only just begun.
###Chapter 246: Will This Work?

At the auction, Lucy White's attention was drawn to several antiques radiating unusual energy. Besides the millennia-old coral tree, she spotted a few artifacts imbued with vital energy.

The atmosphere grew tense. Many metaphysics experts had their eyes on these treasures, driving the bidding wars to unprecedented heights.

Lucy only managed to secure a tortoise shell and a miasma pendant. Her wallet was drained, yet a satisfied smile played on her lips.

"Miss White, a moment please."

Hunter Wilde intercepted her as the auction concluded. Lowering his voice, he said, "I need your help with something."

Ethan Smith subtly closed the distance between them.

Hugo Wilde joined them. "Bro, what's so secretive?"

After scanning their surroundings, Hugo said, "Let's discuss this in my office."

Julian Chase tactfully excused himself, followed by Evan York and David Wilson.

The office was fragrant with brewing tea.

Hugo poured Lucy a cup. "My girlfriend's cousin is experiencing... unusual symptoms."

"Oh?" Lucy arched an eyebrow.

"After returning from a southern trip," Hugo whispered, "his belly keeps expanding like a pregnancy."

Lucy's teacup froze mid-air.

"Even stranger," Hugo's voice dropped further, "it moves."

Ethan suddenly spoke. "When did this start?"

"Two weeks ago." Hugo looked at Lucy. "Could you examine him today?"

Lucy set down her cup. "I'm available now."

Hugo exhaled in relief, then hesitated.

Hunter bluntly interjected: "Bro, did you forget to mention how insane that family is?"

En route, Hugo awkwardly explained: "The Quinns... can be difficult."

Their car stopped before a European-style villa.

Tiffany Quinn stood at the entrance with a strained smile. "So this is... the expert?"

Her gaze lingered on Lucy's delicate features, jealousy flashing in her eyes.

Upstairs, Elder Quinn clutched her grandson's hand, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing the newcomers, she rushed forward. "Hugo dear..."

Her smile froze upon noticing Lucy.

"This... is the expert?" Her voice rose an octave.

Mr. Quinn Junior openly scoffed. "Are you joking? What could someone this young possibly know?"

Mrs. Quinn shrieked: "Our son is dying, and you bring us some little girl to fool us?"

Lucy remained still, a faint smile on her lips.

Hugo's expression darkened. "Mind your words, Mr. Quinn!"

"I don't care!" Quinn Junior pointed at Lucy. "What can this brat possibly do? Get someone else!"

A bloodcurdling scream erupted from the bedroom.

"Ah! It's—it's moving again!"

They turned to see Quinn's son writhing in agony, his stomach grotesquely distended with something undulating beneath the skin.

Lucy's eyes sharpened as she strode forward.

"Stop!" Elder Quinn blocked her path. "What are you doing to my grandson?"

Lucy said coldly, "Delay any longer, and he won't survive the night."

Mrs. Quinn screamed: "You're cursing my child!"

Hunter lost his temper. "Damn it! Do you want to save him or not?"

The young man suddenly emitted an inhuman shriek as blood seeped through his abdominal skin.

Lucy shoved the old woman aside, golden light flickering at her fingertips.

"Now, everyone shut up!"
###Chapter 247: Karmic Retribution

"What kind of attitude is this?" Hugo Wilde's face darkened like storm clouds.

His knuckles turned white from clenching his fists. If not for his girlfriend Yvonne Quinn's desperate pleas, he would never have dragged Lucy White into this mess.

Elder Quinn forced an awkward smile, trying to mediate: "Mr. Wilde, please don't be angry. We just thought Master Lucy seemed rather young—"

"And what of it?" Hugo cut her off with a sneer. "She saved my brother's life."

On the hospital bed, Evan Quinn suddenly convulsed violently, beads of sweat rolling down his forehead.

"Ah! It hurts!" he howled in agony, his stomach grotesquely swelling as if something writhed beneath his skin.

Lucy watched coldly before retrieving a specially crafted incense stick from her bag. The moment it ignited, Evan's screams ceased abruptly.

"What did you do to my grandson?" Elder Quinn panicked, rushing to the bedside.

"Just verification," Lucy replied icily. "He's been afflicted with a Southern love hex."

The Quinn family's faces paled instantly. Mrs. Quinn shrieked, "Nonsense! Hexes in this day and age?"

"Shut up!" Evan suddenly roared, his face ashen. "She's right... That bitch did curse me..."

Trembling, he gripped the sheets, venom flashing in his eyes. "She swore I'd rot from within and die in agony..."

Lucy's gaze frosted over. "You raped that Miao girl and left her corpse in the wilderness."

The room plunged into dead silence.

Hugo recoiled, releasing Yvonne's hand as he stared in disbelief at the young man who once called him "brother-in-law."

"That's not true!" Evan suddenly knelt on the bed, tears and snot streaming down his face. "She seduced me! She—"

"Enough!" Lucy snapped sharply. "Karma always collects its dues."

She turned to leave but was blocked by Yvonne.

"Master Lucy, please save him..." Yvonne wept pitifully. "We'll pay any price..."

Lucy's eyes turned blade-sharp. "Some paths, once taken, can't be undone."

Shoving Yvonne aside, she strode toward the door without looking back. Behind her, Evan's hysterical screams erupted: "What kind of master refuses to save a life?"

Hugo hurried after Lucy, bowing deeply. "My apologies for wasting your time."

Lucy paused mid-step. "Mr. Wilde, a word of advice—stay far away from this family."

As she left, Evan's agonized wails echoed down the hallway—a chilling mirror of the Miao girl's dying cries.
###Chapter 248: Blackmail

Lucy White cast a cold glance at Yu Fei before turning to Hugo Wilde. "This is beyond my control."

Hugo wore an apologetic expression. "He brought this upon himself." He gestured politely. "Let me walk you out."

Lucy knew Hugo was unaware of the situation and saw no reason to blame him.

"Master Lucy!" Yu Fei suddenly rolled off the hospital bed, stumbling toward her. "I was wrong! Please save me!"

Ethan Smith reacted swiftly, kicking the man away.

Old Mrs. Yu immediately realized the young woman before her possessed genuine skill.

"Money is no object!" she rushed forward. "If you'd just—"

Lucy didn’t even spare her a glance.

She could indeed cure the blood hex—but she refused.

"I can't help," she said flatly, turning to leave.

Hugo blocked the Yu family from pursuing her. "Don’t waste your effort."

His icy gaze swept over Yu Wen before he strode away without another word.

Yu Wen’s parents pulled at her. "Go beg Hugo!"

"If your brother dies, our family line ends!"

Yu Fei wailed, "Sis, I’m your own brother!"

Biting her lip, Yu Wen chased after Hugo.

"Hugo!" She grabbed his sleeve. "Fei has learned his lesson—"

He shook her off. "A lesson? He wouldn’t admit fault if death weren’t at his doorstep."

"That girl is dead," he said, voice glacial. "He deserves to pay with his life."

Tears streamed down Yu Wen’s face. "The dead can’t return—"

"We can compensate her family—"

Hunter Wilde scoffed. "Only a life for a life counts as compensation."

Yu Wen ignored him, staring desperately at Hugo. "Just this once. Will you help or not?"

Hugo’s gaze turned frigid. "You want me to aid a murderer?"

"Then we’re through!" The words burst from her lips.

She expected panic—but instead, Hugo nodded slowly. "Fine."

Yu Wen froze as if struck by lightning. "You—"

"Today, I finally see you clearly." He turned and walked away.

Trembling, Yu Wen couldn’t believe it. The man who’d always indulged her had just cut her off without hesitation.

A horrifying realization dawned—she’d miscalculated. Badly.
###Chapter 249: Crossing the Line

A flicker of surprise passed through Hugo Wilde's eyes.

He chuckled darkly. "I'm not the one ending this. You started it."

"Looking back, we were never right for each other."

Thank God he'd realized it early. Divorcing after marriage and kids would've been a nightmare.

Over the past year, Tiffany Quinn's true colors had gradually surfaced.

But until today, she'd never crossed his red line.

This time, she'd stomped straight into his minefield.

The absurd part? She actually thought threatening him with a breakup would work.

Tiffany wasn't naive—she'd lasted a year with Hugo for a reason.

She knew him too well. This time, he meant it.

"No!" Panic seized her. "I spoke without thinking—I was just upset!"

"Hugo, I'm sorry. Let's not break up, okay?"

She truly loved him. She couldn't lose him.

Hugo pried her fingers off his arm. "Too late."

"Words can't be taken back."

He turned to leave.

Tiffany lunged to hug him from behind.

Hugo sidestepped coldly.

"Keep harassing me," he warned, "and I'll have no problem dismantling the Quinn family."

She froze.

Tiffany knew Hugo never made empty threats.

"Then... let's take some time apart?" she sobbed.

Hugo didn't look back. "Unnecessary."

He signaled Hunter and the others to get in the car.

Watching the taillights disappear, Tiffany was consumed by regret.

This was all her uncle and aunt's stupid idea.

Did they really think someone like Hugo Wilde could be threatened?

She comforted herself: Once he cooled off, she'd smooth things over.

Then she remembered—her cousin's predicament remained unsolved.

How would she face her family?

After lingering outside, she finally dragged herself back inside.

As expected, the Quinn matriarch tore into her.

"Useless girl! Can't even keep a man in line!"

"And that Lucy White bitch has no respect either!"

But the scolding wasn't the end.

"Make Hugo agree to help, or don't bother coming home!"

In the car:

Hunter shot his brother a sidelong glance. "Real stellar taste you've got."

"Good riddance. Saved our family from future drama."

Hugo rubbed his temples. "The family kept pressuring me."

"She seemed gentle and dutiful—good wife material."

"Later I realized the Quinns were problematic, but I overlooked it."

"Never imagined her morals were this twisted."

At least today revealed her true nature.

Hunter raised a brow. "You don't seem heartbroken."

Hugo smirked. "Why would I be?"

"Means you never loved her," Hunter pointed out.

Hugo admitted freely: "True."

"The family wanted me married, so I looked for someone suitable."

At most, he'd felt responsible for Tiffany.

Hunter mused, "Real love's hard to come by."

"I've never met anyone who made my heart race."

Hugo flicked his brother's forehead. "Stop pretending to be profound."

Turning to Lucy, he apologized sincerely: "About today—I'm truly sorry."

Lucy waved it off. "Not your fault."

At least Hugo had principles.

Had he pleaded for Tiffany, she'd have cut ties immediately.

"I owe you one," Hugo said gravely.

Hunter suddenly interjected: "Lucy, does this count as toxic romance?"

Lucy: "......"

"No marital compatibility," she said bluntly. "Even if they stayed together, it wouldn't last."

Tiffany was too easily swayed by her family.

And Hugo's patience had limits.

For elite families like the Wildes, problematic in-laws were unacceptable.

As for Evan Quinn—

She didn't mention the hex's trigger: more women.

The more he slept around, the more agonizing his death.

Scum like him deserved no sympathy.

The entire Quinn family was morally bankrupt.

Allies with the Wildes? They'd become enemies soon enough.
###Chapter 250: Scandal Rocks High Society

Hugo Wilde's eyes flickered with surprise.
Lucy White's observational skills were truly remarkable.

Recalling his relationship with Tiffany Quinn, the beginning had indeed been sweet.
She would wait for him after work with gentle smiles, occasionally撒娇asking him to pick her up.
Back then, he thought she was the perfect match.

But gradually, everything soured.
"Hugo, my brother wants an internship at your company."
"My father mentioned that project..."
The Gould family's demands were endless, one after another.

The final straw came last week.
When Winston Gould's drunk driving caused an accident, Tiffany tearfully begged him to cover it up.
In that moment, he saw their relationship for what it truly was.

"Miss White has sharp eyes indeed." He shook his head with a bitter smile.
This relationship should have ended long ago.

Hunter Wilde interjected nervously, "Bro, this won't affect your luck, right?"
Still traumatized by his ex's craziness.

"Relax." Hugo ruffled his brother's hair. "Your brother has terrible taste in women but decent karma."

Turning to Lucy, an idea struck him.
"Miss White, would you consider endorsing Stellar Watches?"

Lucy's lashes fluttered.
Stellar Watches? That was a top luxury brand.
Last year's ambassador was Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Knight, and this year several A-listers were vying for the spot.

"I'd be honored." She accepted gracefully. "My agent will contact you with details."

Ethan Smith's grip tightened on the steering wheel.
Through the rearview mirror, he saw the appreciative look Hugo gave Lucy.

Late at night.
Lucy opened her laptop, a cold smile playing on her lips.
Her slender fingers flew across the keyboard.

#SHOCKING! Forbidden Affair in High Society#
The headline instantly went viral.

The nine-grid photos showed Winston Gould's hand resting on his stepdaughter's waist.
Giselle Gould gazed up at him with unmistakably flirtatious eyes.

The internet exploded.
[WTF! He's old enough to be her father!]
[Mrs. Von's got interesting hobbies... someone check on Frederick's hairline]

More damning evidence surfaced.
Intimate photos of Giselle with various men.
Each oozing with questionable intimacy.

Von Jewelry's website crashed under the onslaught.
[Mr. Von, seen your wife's greatest hits?]
[Might want a paternity test lol]

Gould Group's stocks plummeted.
High society watched the scandal unfold with popcorn-ready glee.

Lucy closed her laptop and sipped her black tea.
This was only the beginning.
###Chapter 251: Explosive Scandal in High Society

In the VIP hospital room, Beatrice Gould held her daughter Fiona Von's hand, whispering words of comfort.

"Mom, how dare that bitch spread such lies!" Fiona clenched the bed rail so tightly her nails nearly dug into the wood.

A dark glint flashed in Beatrice's eyes. "Be patient. We'll deal with it after your father wakes up."

Fiona's chest heaved with rage. Her social media feed was already flooded with reposts of Lucy White's exposé. Those society girls who used to fawn over her were now laughing at her expense.

"I'll make her wish she were dead," Fiona hissed through gritted teeth.

Just then, Frederick Von's fingers twitched on the hospital bed.

"Dad's waking up!" Instantly switching to a concerned expression, Fiona rushed to his side.

When Frederick opened his eyes and saw the two women hovering over him, his face darkened further.

Beatrice immediately burst into tears. "Frederick, I never imagined Giselle would do such things..."

While dabbing her eyes, she stole glances at Frederick's reaction. Seeing his expression soften slightly, she pressed her advantage. "I've already confined Giselle to her room for reflection. We'll make her apologize to Grace properly—"

Frederick waved a tired hand. "Tell her not to come back."

Fiona's phone suddenly vibrated violently. Seeing her boyfriend's name on the caller ID, she hurried into the hallway.

"Your mother's dirty laundry is all over trending topics!" he spat before she could speak. "We're done!"

Fiona froze as if struck by lightning. "Let me explain—"

"Explain what? The entire elite circle knows everything!" His cold laugh sent chills down her spine. "Your mother's affairs, how you stole your best friend's fiancé—who doesn't know now?"

The line went dead. With trembling fingers, Fiona opened Twitter. The top three trending hashtags glared back at her:
#GouldMistressScandal
#FionaTheHomewrecker
#HeiressShowdown

The comments section was even worse:
"Professional homewreckers, the both of them."
"Heard Miss Von tried seducing Hunter Wilde at the gala too!"
"DM me your rates, sugar~"

Her vision blurred. The phone clattered to the floor. Fiona had always been the pampered socialite—when had she ever suffered such humiliation?

"Lucy...White..." She ground out the name between clenched teeth, eyes burning with hatred.

Back in the room, Beatrice was still coaxing Frederick in honeyed tones. "Darling, don't upset yourself—"

Fiona burst in, face ashen. "Mom! It's everywhere!"

Beatrice took one look at the phone and nearly fainted. The vulgar comments on social media stabbed at her like knives.

"This...this..." Her lips trembled before she whirled toward Frederick. "You must defend our honor!"

Puzzled, Frederick took the phone. His face turned livid within seconds. As he scrolled, his breathing grew ragged.

"Disgraceful!" he roared suddenly, hurling the phone against the wall.

Both women jumped in fright.

"Dad, it's all Lucy's lies—" Fiona began desperately.

"Lies?" Frederick sneered. "Are these photoshopped too?"

He pointed at the shattered screen, where crystal-clear images showed Beatrice entering hotels with different men.

Fiona's legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap. At that moment, she knew—this time, they were truly finished.
###Chapter 252: Swift Retribution

Fiona Von's fingers trembled as she scrolled through her phone screen, each vicious comment stabbing into her eyes like knives.

"So this is what it feels like to be cyberbullied..." She bit her lip hard, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

She used to love hiding behind her keyboard, fanning the flames while watching others get torn apart. Now that the tables had turned, she finally understood the agony.

"What do I do...?" Panicked, she lifted her gaze and spotted Beatrice Gould nearby.

"Grandma!" She practically threw herself at the older woman. "The internet is tearing us apart! They're saying Mom and Grandpa—"

Before she could finish, Winston Gould's gravelly voice cut in. "What trending topic? Show me!"

Fiona froze, realizing her mistake too late. Her grip on the phone tightened as she instinctively pulled it back. Some comments even speculated she was the old man's illegitimate child—just the thought made her nauseous.

"Hand it over!" The old man's tone brooked no argument.

Beatrice cursed inwardly at her granddaughter's stupidity but couldn't intervene fast enough. She knew this man too well—his pride was everything, and in situations like this, he'd only take his fury out on others.

Sure enough, after scanning the phone, Winston's face turned ashen before he suddenly coughed up blood and collapsed like a felled tree.

"Call an ambulance!" Beatrice stomped her foot in agitation. Not out of concern for the old man—but because he hadn't amended his will yet! If he died now, that bitch Grace White would inherit half the family fortune!

In her apartment, Lucy White carefully carved intricate sigils into a blood-red coral bead.

This millennia-old coral contained the exact yang energy her brother Noah needed. Channeling spiritual power through her fingertips, she etched each symbol with precision.

"Done." Wiping her brow, she picked up her phone and smirked at the trending hashtag: #GiselleGouldsSugarBabies. The attached photos showed her wicked stepmother cozying up with various young men.

"Saved me the trouble." Lucy chuckled. She had similar photos ready to release in a few days.

The Von family mansion had turned into an icebox of tension.

The moment Giselle stepped inside, she was met with Frederick Von's thunderous expression.

"Darling, let me explain—" She forced a smile. "Those are all Lucy's fabrications! Dad and I are completely innocent!"

Frederick hurled his phone at her face. "Then what about these 'innocent' moments with your boy toys?"

The screen displayed a clearly recognizable photo of her locking lips with a younger man—pixelated but unmistakable.

"I—" Her legs gave out, sending her crumpling to the floor.

Frederick's veins bulged. "Divorce. And tomorrow, we're getting a paternity test!" He grabbed his coat and slammed the door, leaving Giselle trembling on the marble tiles.

Karma had arrived—swift and merciless as a tornado.
###Chapter 253: Karma Strikes Back

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse restaurant as Lucy White peeled a boiled egg for her mother.

"Try this, Mom," she said, offering the pristine egg white.

Grace White accepted it just as her phone vibrated. A glance at the screen made her brow furrow.

"What's wrong?" Lucy instantly noticed the shift in her mother's demeanor.

Grace slid the phone toward her. "The Von family is trending again."

Lucy's lips curled into a cold smile. The screen displayed Frederick Von and Giselle Gould, their faces smeared with blood in a ghastly tableau.

"Serves them right," she murmured, calmly continuing to peel the eggshell.

Three days ago, she'd received an email from a private investigator—intimate photos of Giselle with various young men, each shot crystal clear, down to the hotel room numbers.

"I posted the first thread," Lucy admitted without hesitation. "But the ones after that weren't me."

Grace set down her chopsticks, her gaze complicated. "Your father—Frederick—values his reputation above all."

"Which is why he deserves to lose every shred of it." Lucy's smile turned icy. "They slandered you back then. Now they're getting exactly what they gave."

Memories flooded in. At fifteen, she'd watched Giselle scream in her mother's face, calling her a "homewrecker." The whole school had whispered that Grace seduced a married man, and even Lucy hadn’t escaped the pointed fingers.

"Does it bother you?" Lucy ventured.

Grace shook her head gently, her eyes serene. "I stopped considering them family long ago."

Another notification chimed—a video this time. Fiona Von shrieked hysterically in a hospital hallway, her usual socialite poise obliterated.

"How entertaining." Lucy propped her chin on her hand, watching with relish.

Grace turned off the screen. "Eat. Cold food upsets your stomach."

Lucy nodded obediently, though her mind was already calculating her next move. She knew Frederick's greatest weakness—his meticulously crafted facade of respectability.

Sure enough, by noon, Von Jewelry's stock prices plummeted. The board called an emergency meeting, demanding Frederick explain himself.

Meanwhile, in a VIP hospital suite, Frederick stared at his reflection. Blood seeped through the bandage on his temple, the man in the mirror a far cry from his usual polished self.

"Dad!" Felix Von burst in. "Grandfather wants to hold a press conference—"

"Get out!" Frederick smashed the mirror. Shards scattered, slicing his knuckles.

Twenty years ago, he'd thrown Grace out just like this—her arms wrapped around a young Lucy, her slender back straight despite the humiliation.

"Karma," he whispered as blood dripped from his wrist.

Across town, Lucy sipped afternoon tea, her phone buzzing incessantly with updates that deepened her smile.

"An eye for an eye," she murmured over her Earl Grey. "And this is only the beginning."

Sunlight bathed her delicate profile. No one would guess this seemingly harmless girl was orchestrating a masterful game of vengeance.
###Chapter 254: The Unexpected

After finishing her training, Lucy White wiped the sweat from her forehead.

Her phone buzzed incessantly with notifications about the plummeting stock prices of the Gould Group and Von Jewelry.

A faint smirk curled her lips as she tossed the phone into her bag.

Ever since the ancestral gravesite's feng shui had been tampered with, the Goulds' new projects had collapsed one after another, while their existing ventures faced constant mishaps.

Old Mr. Gould lay in his VIP hospital bed, his blood pressure spiking in fury.

"Chairman, the doctor said if you continue like this—" His assistant hesitated.

"Get out!" The old man hurled a glass across the room.

Gasping for breath, he dialed Grace White's number.

"Your daughter has gone too far!" he snarled, only to be met with a cold laugh.

"Mr. Gould, perhaps you should worry about your illegitimate child first."

The dial tone that followed was deafening.

At the Von family estate, the air was thick with tension.

"Grandfather, I—" Felix Von began, only to be cut off.

"Silence!" The patriarch slammed his palm on the table. "As of today, you're no longer the heir!"

Fiona Von dug her nails into her palms until they drew blood.

In a hospital corridor, she handed a sealed envelope to a nurse.

"Expedited paternity test. I need the results today."

Meanwhile, Frederick Von's secretary carried another sample into a different hospital.

Lucy sat cross-legged on her balcony, two bowls of water before her.

With a flick of her finger, a talisman ignited without a spark.

"Fiona Von, I hope you're ready for this gift."

In the lab, a doctor adjusted his glasses.

"Miss Von, the results are in."

Fiona tore open the report—and turned deathly pale.

"No... this can't be!"

Felix snatched the document, his eyes widening.

"Sis... you and Dad... you're not related?"

Suddenly remembering something, he lowered his voice. "Then those rumors online—"

"Shut up!" Fiona dragged him out. "We're asking Mom!"

In the hospital room, Giselle Gould was painting her nails.

"Mom!" Fiona threw the report onto the bed. "Explain this!"

Giselle glanced at it idly—then froze.

"This... this is impossible..."

Her hands trembled as she scanned the document repeatedly.

Fiona's eyes burned with unshed tears. "Whose daughter am I really?"

Outside, dusk deepened.

A greater storm was gathering.
###Chapter 255: The Truth Revealed

Fiona Von's fingers trembled as she clutched the paternity report.

"Mom, how am I supposed to believe this?" Her voice shook.

Giselle Gould grabbed her daughter's wrist. "The hospital must have made a mistake!"

Her tone was absolute. "Frederick Von is your father!"

Fiona bit her lip, studying her mother's unwavering expression. "Fine. I'll have it checked again."

Her heels clicked sharply against the floor as she turned and left.

Three hours later.

Frederick Von's secretary rushed into his office.

"Mr. Von, the results are in."

Frederick took the file, his fingers cold. The moment he read the report, he slammed it onto the desk.

"Those damn Goulds!" he snarled.

The secretary stood frozen, not daring to breathe.

"Contact Attorney Wilson," Frederick said, his voice icy. "I want a divorce. Now."

Meanwhile.

Fiona stared at the fresh report, her vision blurring.

"How...?"

With shaking hands, she dialed her mother. "The results are the same."

A long silence stretched on the other end.

"Impossible!" Giselle shrieked. "You are—"

Fiona hung up.

She took a deep breath and dialed another number. "I need a forged report."

At the hospital.

Frederick placed both reports side by side on the table.

"Explain," he said coldly.

Fiona paled.

"Get out of my sight," Frederick turned toward the window. "And don't ever come back."

The Von family estate.

The elder Von hung up the phone, his expression stormy.

"Move the timeline forward," he told the butler.

As the butler bowed and left, the sound of shattering porcelain echoed from the study.

By evening.

Fiona stood outside the Von mansion, dragging her suitcase behind her.

"Miss, the master has ordered—" the butler hesitated.

"I understand." She straightened her spine and walked toward the waiting taxi.

The Gould residence blazed with light.

The moment Fiona stepped inside, she heard the click of a camera.

She whirled around—but only saw rustling shadows.

Late that night.

A bombshell exploded across a popular forum:

[EXPOSED! The Shocking Truth About the Von Heiress!]

Attached were clear images of the paternity report and Fiona entering the Gould estate.

The comments erupted:

"Holy hell, this is crazier than fiction!"

"So those gala rumors were true?"

"I'm hooked! What's next?!"

Fiona scrolled through the posts, her nails digging into her palms.

Suddenly, she remembered Lucy White's knowing smile at the gala.

"Lucy..." she whispered, her eyes darkening.

Outside, the moonlight was cold and unforgiving.
###Chapter 256: Karma's Justice

The night breeze carried a chill through the capital.

The Gould Group's headquarters blazed with light, but nothing could mask the turmoil within. In just half a month, the once-glorious family empire now teetered on the brink of collapse.

"Chairman, the stock hit the limit-down again today," the secretary adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his tone eerily calm.

Old Gould smashed his teacup against the floor. "Useless! All of you!"

He still couldn't comprehend how his affair with Fiona Von had triggered this catastrophic downfall.

Unbeknownst to him, several major shareholders were already conspiring in the boardroom.

"Old Gould's finished. We need to cut our losses."

"I heard the Von family is preparing to flee."

"Serves him right. His lust dragged us all down."

......

Lucy White stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the city's endless stream of headlights.

"The Goulds are done," she murmured, taking a sip of coffee, her lips curling into a cold smile.

Sophia Taylor entered with a file. "Flight's booked. We leave for the States the day after tomorrow."

"Mm." Lucy turned. "Before we go, let's visit our alma mater."

The university gates buzzed with students even at dusk.

"Remember that barbecue stall?" Sophia pointed to a small shop. "The owner still recognizes us."

They shared a smile, momentarily transported back to carefree college days.

"By the way," Sophia lowered her voice, "Hunter's been finding excuses to take me to dinner lately."

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"Do you think he—" Sophia's words died as a chill ran down her spine.

Lucy yanked her wrist. "Move!"

A corrosive stench grazed past them. White smoke hissed from the scorched pavement.

"Vanessa?" Sophia gasped at the disheveled woman emerging from the shadows.

Vanessa Knight clutched two glass bottles, madness gleaming in her eyes. "This is all your fault!"

Lucy shielded Sophia calmly. "Your brother's choices weren't my doing. As for Hugo—"

"Liar!" Vanessa shrieked. "If you hadn't seduced him—"

She twisted a cap open. Concentrated sulfuric acid glinted lethally under the streetlights.

A sudden unnatural gust swirled.

The acid arced backward, dousing Vanessa entirely.

"Karma," Lucy observed coldly as the woman writhed on the ground, already dialing the police.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Ethan Smith arrived breathlessly as Lucy gave her statement.

"Are you hurt?"

"Hardly." Lucy smirked. "Though someone should leash his admirer."

Hunter Wilde rubbed his neck sheepishly, gaze drifting toward Sophia.

Ethan scowled. "That lunatic belongs in a cell."

"Don't worry." Lucy watched paramedics load the screaming woman away. "She'll never see daylight again."

The night wind carried away the last traces of acrid smoke.

Poetic justice was never just a saying.
###Chapter 257: Compatibility

Ethan Smith and Hugo Wilde's expressions darkened instantly after hearing the full story.

"Do you know what's going on?" Ethan tapped his slender fingers against the desk, his sharp gaze fixed on Hugo.

Hugo let out a bitter chuckle. "Tiffany Quinn has been pestering me to get back together. She even insisted I ask Lucy White to treat her cousin."

He paused. "After I refused, her cousin died. She probably blamed Lucy for it."

"As for Sophia Taylor..." Hugo's eyes flickered. "We had dinner twice. Tiffany must have misunderstood."

Lucy mused, "Given Tiffany's personality, she wouldn’t come up with such a revenge plot on her own. Someone must be pulling the strings behind the scenes."

Hugo nodded. "I’ll get to the bottom of it." He gave them both a solemn promise. "You’ll have your answers."

Sophia's phone suddenly rang, and she stepped aside to take the call.

Lucy lowered her voice. "As the chairman of a conglomerate, why are you personally handling endorsement deals for a subsidiary?"

Hugo's ears turned faintly pink. "I find Sophia... unique."

That day at the nursing home, watching her patiently play chess with the elderly, his heart had skipped a beat.

"I want to know her better," Hugo admitted. "If things feel right, I’ll pursue her properly."

Lucy arched a brow. "And if she rejects you?"

"Then it wasn’t meant to be." Hugo smiled easily. "I won’t force it."

Only then did Lucy look satisfied.

After leaving the police station, Hugo offered to drive Sophia home. Glancing at Lucy and Ethan standing side by side, Sophia tactfully accepted his offer.

"Do you think they’re compatible?" Lucy couldn’t help asking once they were in the car.

Ethan chuckled. "Hugo’s never been this invested in anyone before." He turned the steering wheel. "The Wilde family is open-minded. As long as her character is good, they won’t care about her background."

Lucy finally relaxed.

"I’ll take you tomorrow," Ethan said suddenly.

Lucy smiled and nodded. "Remember to watch the livestream. We might just win the championship."

Warmth flickered in Ethan’s eyes. "I’ll be waiting."

The next day at the airport, Ethan adjusted Lucy’s scarf. "Be careful."

"Got it." She waved at him before heading through security.

Meanwhile, Asher York was already waiting at the foreign airport. After picking up Lucy, they went straight to the hotel.

Two days later, at the competition venue.

The international event utilized cutting-edge holographic tech, broadcast live worldwide. Led by the production crew, the five contestants boarded a helicopter headed for the arena.

Amid the roar of the rotors, Lucy gazed out the window at the shrinking cityscape below, her heartbeat quickening uncontrollably.
###Chapter 258: Doubts

The helicopter hovered over the azure sea, its rotor blades whipping Lucy White’s hair into a frenzy.

"We’re landing soon," Asher York murmured in warning.

Lucy peered through the window as an island blanketed in lush greenery came into view. Unlike the desolate survival island from before, this arena was meticulously designed.

"Security here is tight," she noted, spotting surveillance cameras positioned throughout the landscape.

The helicopter touched down smoothly. The moment the door opened, blinding sunlight made Lucy squint.

"Welcome to Arena Island!" A male and female host approached them.

The male host spoke in fluent English. "You’re Team Seven. Here are your badges."

Asher took the badges and glanced at Lucy. "Need a translator?"

"No need." She accepted hers, fingertips brushing over the intricate dragon emblem etched into the cold metal surface.

The female host added with a smile, "The global livestream has already begun."

Lucy looked up to find over a dozen cameras trained on them. Without missing a beat, she adjusted her collar and pinned the badge to her chest.

Several teams were already seated in the rest area. As Lucy’s group passed, competitors from various countries studied them with curious eyes.

"Is that... a celebrity?" someone whispered.

Asher subtly shifted to block their view. "Ignore them."

Lucy’s lips curved. "I’m used to it."

Meanwhile, the domestic livestream exploded.

[Is that really Lucy White?!]
[The official list confirms it’s her!]
[Lucy’s insane! How’d she qualify for an international military competition?!]

But skepticism quickly followed.

[A celebrity in a combat tournament? You’re joking.]
[She’ll just drag the team down.]
[There’s definitely foul play here.]

At Topaz Entertainment headquarters, David Wilson stared at his screen, brow furrowed.

"Mr. Wilson, the website’s crashing from traffic," his assistant reported urgently.

David tapped the desk. "Release a statement—Lucy earned her spot fairly."

The announcement eased some backlash, but doubts lingered.

[What are her qualifications?]
[Can’t wait to see her humiliated.]

In a luxury apartment, Lily Green dug her nails into her palms as she glared at the screen.

"Why does she always get everything?" She snatched her phone and dialed Oliver Knight.

"Oliver, are you watching this?"

A pause. Then, "I am."

Her voice trembled. "Do you think she could...?"

"Don’t overthink it," he cut in. "Focus on your new project."

After hanging up, Oliver studied Lucy’s composed profile on-screen, his expression unreadable.

The livestream chat continued to flood.

[Waiting for the epic fail!]
[I believe in Lucy!]

As if sensing the attention, Lucy suddenly looked directly into the camera, her lips curving into a confident smile.

The close-up sent the chat into chaos.

[AHHH SHE KILLED ME!]
[That smirk is lethal!]

Asher leaned in. "Nervous?"

She shook her head, scanning the other teams. "They should be."

Rolling her wrists, the badge glinted coldly in the sunlight.

The global broadcast captured the subtle movement perfectly. No one noticed her finger tracing the tiny inscription on the back:

"Winner takes all."
###Chapter 259: The Failed Scheme

In the CEO's office of Knight Group, Oliver Knight stared at the international arena livestream on his computer screen.

He had no interest in such events, but there she was—Lucy White, the woman who made his Lily seethe with hatred, and the rising star of their rival company, Stellar Entertainment.

"Tch, a Stellar pet," he sneered, drumming his fingers on the desk.

The online rumors questioning Lucy's qualifications, which he'd orchestrated days ago, had been effortlessly dismantled by that David Wilson.

The office door swung open as Lily Green strode in on stilettos.

"What brings you here unannounced?" Oliver arched a brow, pulling her into his lap. "Missed me?"

Lily playfully shoved him. "Be serious. I have an idea."

She produced a tablet from her bag, pointing at the livestream. "Look how smug Lucy is. Let's turn the tables—hire people to pose as her fans and harass other competitors."

Oliver's eyes gleamed. "Brilliant."

He immediately called his PR team to mobilize troll accounts. After hanging up, their pent-up tension spilled onto the office couch.

Later, Lily eagerly refreshed the livestream. "Let's see the chaos."

Yet the screen showed no trace of the expected uproar.

"What's this?" Oliver's expression darkened as he dialed his assistant.

Slamming the phone down, he growled, "All the accounts got banned! Even the keywords are blocked!"

Lily gaped. "Who has that kind of pull? This is the official broadcast!"

"Either the organizers cracked down, or..." Oliver narrowed his eyes, "someone's protecting Lucy."

Her jealousy flared. "Let's try another approach—"

"Enough!" Oliver snapped. "With official intervention, you want to self-destruct?"

Seeing her flinch, he softened his tone. "If she's truly unqualified, it'll show during the competition."

Lily bit her lip in frustration but relented.

Meanwhile, across town, Ethan Smith sipped red wine leisurely. Having anticipated sabotage, he'd secured administrative privileges from the event organizers beforehand.

"Oliver Knight..." He swirled his glass, jotting the name in his blacklist notebook.

On Arena Island, 120 teams assembled. As the host took the stage, the crowd hushed.

"Let the International Arena Championship begin!"

Global viewership instantly surpassed 10 million. The camera lingered two extra seconds on Lucy—calmly adjusting her gear with a confident smile.
###Chapter 260: This Is Real Excitement

"Boom!"

With a deafening explosion, blue smoke erupted at the center of the stage. As the haze dissipated, a massive holographic screen materialized, pulsing with an eerie azure glow.

The entire arena fell silent.

"Attention all competitors," the male host's voice echoed through surround sound speakers. "This year's tournament will utilize cutting-edge 6D holographic technology."

His fingers danced through the air, transforming the screen into a three-dimensional model of a bustling metropolis.

"'Doomsday City' is entirely quantum-computer generated," the host explained, his lips curling into a mysterious smile. "Your consciousness will be projected inside. Remember—every sensation will feel completely real."

Data flashed across the screen:

[Time Ratio: 1:1]
[Pain Simulation: 100%]
[Death Penalty: Immediate Elimination]

"Your mission—" The host snapped his fingers, revealing streets overrun by zombies. "Survive 30 days in this apocalyptic wasteland."

Gasps rippled through the audience.

"But that's just the basic requirement." The host's eyes gleamed with mischief. "The real challenge? Find the hidden 'Doomsday Key' somewhere in the city."

He paused dramatically, watching competitors shift nervously.

"Each team gets three clues." He waved a smart bracelet. "But be warned—some clues might be traps."

A muscular contestant stood abruptly. "What if we encounter other teams?"

"Excellent question!" The host clapped excitedly. "In the apocalypse, there are no rules. Cooperate if you want, or..." He drew a finger across his throat. "Eliminate them—permanently."

The crowd erupted in shock.

Lucy White narrowed her eyes. She noticed how the host emphasized "permanently."

"Final warning." The host's expression turned grave. "This system amplifies human emotions. Every decision you make... could trigger catastrophic consequences."

Most competitors laughed it off.

But Lucy's fingers absently traced her wrist. She knew the dangers too well—in hyper-realistic simulations, humanity's darkest instincts often surfaced.

"Now, proceed to your pods in order."

When her turn came, Lucy took a deep breath and stepped into the silver capsule. As the door sealed shut, an icy chill crept through her veins...

Her eyes snapped open to a college dorm room.

The smart bracelet vibrated:
[Countdown: 29:37]
[Primary Objective: Survive]

Lucy moved instantly. She tore bedsheets into a makeshift pack, stuffing it with energy bars and water bottles. Spotting a pen on the desk, she grabbed it—in this world, anything could be a weapon.

Knocking echoed at the door.

"Delivery for you!" a courier called.

Lucy froze. The detail was too precise... unnervingly real.

15 minutes remained.

She bolted toward campus stores, bypassing luxuries for essentials: a multi-tool, flashlight, first-aid kit...

As she stuffed in the last bandage, darkness swallowed the city.

"Groooaaar—"

Unearthly howls pierced the silence.

The world spun violently. When Lucy regained balance, four familiar faces surrounded her.

Doomsday... had officially begun.
###Chapter 261: An Unconventional Choice

The massive doors of the virtual arena slid shut, and the global livestream instantly switched views.

One hundred twenty split screens lit up simultaneously, each displaying a competing team. The main screen automatically highlighted the most thrilling moments, curated by the AI system.

[OMG! Is this really a hologram?]
[Those supermarket customers look so real!]
[Look! There’s our national team!]

As live comments flooded the screen, viewers suddenly noticed something odd.

[Why is Lucy still in the room?]
[Everyone else is already rushing to the supermarket!]
[Did she miss the announcement?]

On-screen, Lucy White calmly gathered supplies, stuffing instant meals and daily necessities into her backpack.

Five minutes later, when other contestants were already scrambling through the supermarket, she finally stepped out with unhurried confidence.

[Why did she stop at the entrance?]
[Wait—she’s checking the map!]
[Time’s running out!]

To everyone’s surprise, Lucy dashed straight to the knife section.

[A machete? Smart choice!]
[Wait, why isn’t she grabbing food?]

Even more astonishingly, after swiftly collecting essentials, she bolted out of the supermarket.

[Where’s she going now?]
[A pharmacy! There’s a pharmacy outside!]
[How did she know?]

When night fell, the five teammates finally regrouped.

"Show me what you’ve got," Captain Xavier Boone ordered.

As they unloaded their backpacks, everyone’s eyes widened at Lucy’s haul—rows of meticulously packed medical supplies.

"I didn’t see any meds in the supermarket," Finn Wallace muttered, confused.

Lucy pointed out the window. "There was a map at the entrance. It marked all nearby stores."

Xavier nodded approvingly. "I noticed it too, but there wasn’t enough time."

"Hold on," Asher York suddenly realized, "You went straight for the targets using the map?"

"Obviously." Lucy shook her flashlight. "Maximum efficiency."

Jasper King and Finn exchanged baffled glances.

"Who actually reads a map in a supermarket?"

The livestream exploded:

[That’s genius!]
[Next-level strategy!]
[Totally different from every other team!]
###Chapter 262: The Taste of Being Outsmarted

Lucy White couldn't help but laugh.

"You're still thinking like this is the real world," she said, waving the map in her hand. "This is an apocalypse scenario!"

Xavier Boone adjusted his glasses with a sigh. "They haven't adapted yet."

Asher York and the other two exchanged glances.

Only then did they notice that both Xavier and Lucy were holding maps.

"Smart people check the map first," Xavier remarked pointedly. "Too bad there aren't many smart contestants this time."

Asher and his teammates: "..."

The sarcasm hit them like a freight train.

The live comments exploded.

[Ouch! That shot straight to my knees!]
[I'd have gone straight for the supermarket too!]
[Where are those people who called Lucy pretentious? How's that humble pie tasting?]
[The details! The supplies in the room were clearly enough.]
[The producers are sneaky! They deliberately mentioned the supermarket on the first floor.]
[Only three people actually searched the rooms—Lucy was one of them.]
[The big screen only shows the top-performing contestants.]
[Lucy is the GOAT!]

Meanwhile, Lucy was distributing medical supplies.

Xavier suddenly pointed at the tent. "Why bother with this? Planning a camping trip or running for your life?"

Finn Wallace crossed his arms. "We need to sleep at night, don't we?"

"You think you'll have time to pitch a tent while escaping?" Lucy chuckled. "You'll ditch it within half an hour."

Xavier added, "You'd have been better off grabbing more energy bars."

Finn: "..."

Another indirect roast.

Asher quickly intervened. "Just let them keep it." He held up a bread packet. "Speaking of which, is this food even real?"

The group paused.

Even Xavier looked thoughtful.

"Of course it is." Lucy tore open a packet and took a bite. "Try it and see."

Asher did—and his eyes lit up. "It actually fills you up!"

"How did you know?" Jasper King asked curiously.

Lucy smirked. "Guesswork. The producers must've built a real set on the island. Blending reality with simulation sells the illusion."

She gestured around. "This place is both virtual and real."

The realization dawned on them.

The live comments went wild again.

[This intellectual dominance is everything!]
[Lucy's observation skills are next-level.]
[The producers: Our entire playbook is exposed.]
[Other teams are still confused while they've already cracked the rules.]
[She's playing 4D chess out here.]
###Chapter 263: The Holographic Maze

"What?" Asher York's eyes widened, his water bottle nearly slipping from his grasp.

Lucy White's slender fingers tapped lightly against the warehouse wall. "This isn't a real warehouse. We're still inside the supermarket."

Finn Wallace frowned. "But we ran so far—"

"Illusions," Lucy interrupted. "Holographic tech is overlaying the real environment."

Jasper King silently flicked his lighter open and shut before speaking. "So those zombies..."

"Projections," Lucy confirmed. "But the tactile feedback is real. That's the brilliance of this system."

In the control room, a dozen monitors glowed with blue light.

"How does she know?" A lab-coated researcher adjusted his glasses. "We spent five years developing this."

The chief engineer studied Lucy's profile, fingers drumming the console. "Fascinating."

Ian Evans leaned back in his chair, lips curling in amusement. The girl who'd once treated his illness never failed to surprise him.

Inside the simulated warehouse, Xavier Boone suddenly crouched, running his fingers across the floor. "Temperature's wrong."

"Noticed that?" Lucy smiled. "Actual flooring would be warmer."

Finn scratched his head. "Wait, so where are we really?"

"The seafood section." Lucy pointed toward a corner. "Smell that fishy odor?"

Asher sniffed loudly. "Holy crap, she's right!"

[Live comments exploded]
[What kind of sorcery is this?]
[Is she even human?]
[My mom asked why I'm watching this on my knees]
[All Lucy haters can exit stage left]

"Enough speculation." Lucy clapped her hands. "System alert incoming."

Their smartbands vibrated simultaneously:
[First Clue: Locate the red marker]

Jasper suddenly pointed upward. "There!"

A faint red dot pulsed near the ceiling.

"Move!" Lucy sprinted ahead.

Alarms blared in the control room.
"Warning! Contestants approaching core zone!"

The chief engineer shot to his feet. "Activate Protocol B!"

Ian's eyes narrowed. "Now things get interesting."

[Live comments]
[Oh this is bad!]
[Lucy's about to break the game]
[Production crew messed up big time]
[Popcorn anyone?]

The warehouse doors groaned open, revealing blinding white light laced with swirling data streams.

Lucy turned, flashing a sly grin at the cameras. "Ready to see some real technology?"

Every viewer held their breath.
###Chapter 264: A New Perspective

Lucy White had no idea her recent actions had sent the livestream into a frenzy.

The live comments exploded:
[Holy crap! This girl’s got skills!]
[Who called her a pretty face with no talent? Come take your L!]

Of course, some viewers remained skeptical:
[It’s too early to judge. Let’s see how she handles real danger.]
[Wait till the zombies show up. She’ll probably start crying.]

As the group reached the warehouse exit, they ran into several other teams.

Asher York and the others exchanged smug glances—thanks to Lucy’s warning, they hadn’t been caught off guard like the rest.

"Move fast," Lucy said crisply, checking her watch. "Next round’s starting."

She led the team through the corridor with swift, precise movements.

Then, a bone-chilling growl echoed from ahead.

"Wh-what was that?" Finn Wallace stammered.

Lucy shot him an unimpressed look. "Zombies. Obviously."

Jasper King excitedly brandished his kitchen knife. "Finally, the real deal!"

The live comments went wild:
[LMAO Lucy and Xavier look like they’re babysitting three idiots.]
[The contrast is killing me—brain cells vs. brawn cells.]

When the metal door creaked open, a rotting arm shot through the gap.

"Sh*t!" Asher and Finn yelled in unison, instinctively kicking out.

The zombie staggered back, then lunged again—its decaying face and putrid stench horrifyingly realistic.

"Aim for the head!" Lucy reminded them calmly. "Stop flailing around!"

The three scrambled to follow her advice, barely taking down the first zombie.

Then three more charged at them.

By the time they finished, panting and exhausted, they turned to see Lucy and Xavier lounging casually nearby.

"You guys—" Asher whined.

Xavier adjusted his glasses. "I’m the brains of this operation."

Lucy smoothed her hair. "You expect a refined beauty like me to hack up zombies? Please."

The live chat lost it:
[Confirmed: these three are just her minions.]
[Queen Lucy reigns supreme!]

What shocked viewers most was Lucy’s unflinching reaction to the gore.

"Aren’t you… scared?" Jasper finally asked.

Lucy smirked. "Of what? It’s all fake."

She strode past the zombie corpses without a second glance.

The three guys exchanged looks, realizing one thing:

This girl was badass.

Meanwhile, anti-fans who’d been waiting to mock her quietly deleted their prepared insults.

This… wasn’t going how they’d planned.
###Chapter 265: That's Our Lucy

Lucy White and her team sprinted toward the supermarket's main entrance.

The air was filled with bloodcurdling screams and the guttural growls of zombies, sending chills down their spines.

"Now this feels right," Lucy tightened her grip on the machete. "A supermarket should be this lively."

Asher York let out a low whistle. "The producers really went all out with the sound effects this time."

"Stop treating this like a game," Lucy said sharply, her expression grave. "From now on, this is a real apocalypse."

She scanned her teammates. "Side quests were just the warm-up. The main mission is where things get serious."

Xavier Boone nodded in agreement. "Lucy's right. We need to be all in."

"Help! Please, help us!"

A shrill cry cut through their conversation.

Inside a fast-food restaurant, a mother was desperately fending off two zombies with a mop, shielding a trembling little boy behind her.

"What are you waiting for?" Lucy kicked Finn Wallace. "Go!"

Finn hesitated. "But... aren't these just projections?"

"What if they're real?" Lucy shot back. "Would you just stand there and watch?"

The three exchanged glances before grabbing their weapons and charging forward.

After dispatching the zombies, the mother collapsed to her knees, sobbing uncontrollably as she clutched her child.

A tear from the boy landed on Finn's hand—warm, too real to be data.

"Hell..." Asher muttered. "This is way too realistic."

As they pressed on, they rescued several more groups of survivors.

The parking lot was already swarming with teams scrambling for vehicles.

"Split up and find an armored SUV!" Xavier ordered.

While searching alone, Lucy was suddenly ambushed by a zombie.

Her reflexes kicked in—she swung the machete.

Squelch.

Black blood sprayed.

Lucy paled, her hands trembling slightly around the weapon.

The live feed captured the moment perfectly.

The comments exploded:

[Who said Lucy only bosses men around? Step forward!]
[First zombie kill and that reaction? So authentic.]
[Damn, those moves—I'm in love.]
[Five kills already? She adapts way too fast.]

After rescuing a bespectacled man, he suddenly said, "The military is sending reinforcements."

Lucy's eyes lit up. "Do you know how to get to Central Plaza?"

"It's over an hour on foot," the man adjusted his glasses. "Unless... I could take you there?"

Lucy narrowed her eyes. This NPC... seemed to know a little too much.
###Chapter 266: Did She Not Consider That?

"Come with me." Lucy White's lips curved into a reassuring smile.

She gave the machete in her hand a light shake. "I have a few teammates. If you're scared of staying here, you can lead us to Central Square."

"If we run into the military along the way, you'll be safe."

She had scrolled through several phones earlier, but there was no signal—navigation was useless.

In this situation, having a local guide was undoubtedly the fastest solution.

The man hesitated before finally nodding.

"O-okay." He swallowed hard. "I don’t want to stay in this hellhole a second longer."

Honestly, this scrawny guy didn’t look like he could fight. If they encountered zombies again, he’d be dead meat.

"First, help me find a car," Lucy said.

"No need!" The man suddenly perked up. "I have a modified SUV—top-tier performance!"

Lucy’s eyes lit up. "Where?"

"Underground parking." He shrank back slightly. "But I don’t know if it’s safe now..."

"Lead the way." Lucy was decisive.

[Damn, Lucy just went with a stranger like that?]
[Is this guy a trap?]
[Look at how she’s positioned—always keeping a safe distance.]
[She hasn’t let go of her machete. Clearly, she’s on guard.]

The underground parking was dim and eerie.

A few zombies staggered toward them, but Lucy dispatched them cleanly.

The man trembled the whole time, hiding behind her.

[This looks like a damsel following a badass hero.]
[Lucy’s got max protector energy.]

A rugged seven-seater SUV came into view.

"Get in." Lucy pulled open the passenger door.

With the roar of the engine, the SUV sped toward the rendezvous point.

"Holy shit!" Finn Wallace’s eyes widened. "This ride is sick!"

Xavier Boone whistled. "Only Lucy could pull this off."

The four quickly piled in.

"This is Sam Wilson, our human GPS," Lucy introduced.

Finn gave Sam a hearty pat on the shoulder. "Thanks, man!"

"Don’t mention it." Sam smiled shyly. "Miss White saved me."

As they drove, Lucy and Xavier grilled Sam for intel on the city.

[Other teams are still clueless.]
[Good karma pays off.]
[This feels so real—zero fakeness.]

"Stop!" Lucy suddenly shouted.

She dashed toward a roadside newsstand and returned with a thick stack of maps.

"Take these." She handed one to each of them. "We’re relying on these from now on."

Xavier unfolded his eagerly. "Exactly what we needed!"

Finn looked baffled. "Newsstands sell maps?"

"Common sense, kid." Lucy facepalmed.

The four: "..."

Another burn.

"Whatever," Finn said cheerfully, leaning in. "With Lucy here, we’ll just cheer from the sidelines."

The SUV rolled forward, kicking up dust in its wake.
###Chapter 267: Clever Move

The armored SUV barreled down the street, plowing through zombies that went flying like ragdolls. Lucy White gripped the handrail until her knuckles turned white as the vehicle jolted violently.

"Military convoy ahead!" Finn Wallace shouted suddenly.

Rows of military vehicles stood in formation, soldiers evacuating survivors. Sam Wilson suggested joining their retreat, but Lucy politely declined.

"Keep the truck." Sam tossed her the keys. "Consider it repayment."

He marked their route on the map before jogging to join the soldiers. As the engine roar faded, Finn slid into the driver's seat and floored the accelerator.

Central Plaza loomed ahead. The once-bustling shopping district now lay in ruins, littered with corpses. Crushed glass crunched beneath their tires with ear-splitting screeches.

"Ram through?" Finn tightened his grip on the wheel.

Xavier Boone shook his head. "Won't work. They'll just swarm again."

Lucy produced several red firecracker strings from her backpack, their fuses glinting metallically in sunlight.

"When did you grab those?" Asher York's eyes widened.

"Underground garage." Lucy smirked. "Borrowed from Sam's trunk."

Jasper King whistled. "Always prepared."

The firecrackers exploded with deafening bangs, drawing the zombie horde like moths to flame. Finn seized the moment to execute a sharp U-turn, tires leaving scorch marks on asphalt.

"Split up!" Xavier commanded. "Asher guards the vehicle. Everyone else with me."

Sunlight danced across weathered inscriptions on a stone monument. Lucy's fingers traced the eroded characters when she suddenly froze.

"Jewelry store!" She sprinted away mid-sentence.

A cash register computer flickered to life with eerie blue light, its mechanical female voice echoing through the empty shop:

[Kindness Points×30% + Merit Points×30% + Contribution×30% + Hidden Quest×10% = Total Score 100%]

Lucy pressed her watch's record button, cunning glinting in her eyes.

"Recording?" Xavier arched an eyebrow.

"Insurance policy." She wiggled her wrist. "Might fetch a good price."

Jasper snorted. "Shrewd businesswoman!"

The screen abruptly darkened, displaying a final blood-red warning: [Evidence tamperers will be disqualified immediately!]

"Move out." Xavier pushed through the glass door. "Time to earn our first 'kindness points.'"

Distant zombie growls echoed as Lucy made three backup recordings, stashing them in separate pockets. Sunlight filtering through shattered display windows cast golden flecks across her eyelashes.
###Chapter 268: The Ultimate Move

Lucy White caught the frustrated look on Xavier Boone's face and instantly knew he'd considered recording the clues too—just a second too late.

"Move!" she urged sharply. "The horde's coming back."

Asher York lingered, eyeing the vintage computer with longing.

"If we could just smash it..." he muttered under his breath.

Jasper King wore a similar expression of regret.

Xavier saw right through them.

"Don't even think about it," he said, already striding toward the exit. "Even if the rules allowed it, we shouldn't."

Asher scratched his head. "Why not?"

Instead of answering, Xavier glanced at Lucy. "Explain it to them."

Lucy nodded. "Ever heard of 'shoot the outstanding bird first'?"

"If we're the only ones with complete intel..." She paused meaningfully. "...the other 199 teams would unite against us."

Asher and Jasper exchanged glances, realization dawning.

"Right," Jasper clicked his tongue. "Getting ganged up on would suck."

Lucy added, "Besides, just the five of us..."

"Completing three main missions in a zombie apocalypse?" She shook her head. "No way."

Asher's eyes suddenly lit up. "Wait—you recorded it, didn't you?"

"That recording..." He rubbed his hands together. "How can we use it?"

Lucy smirked. "Oh, it'll be very useful."

Xavier picked up the thread: "This is downtown. The horde will only grow."

"The later teams arrive..." He let the implication hang. "...the harder it'll be for them to get clues."

The five scrambled into their armored SUV. Finn Wallace floored the gas, plowing through lunging zombies.

"You're not thinking..." Jasper's eyes widened. "...of selling the intel?"

Lucy snapped her fingers. "Bingo!"

"Trading for points," she waved her comm device. "I checked with the system—totally legal."

Four sharp intakes of breath echoed in the vehicle.

"Th-that's allowed?!" Asher stammered.

Even Xavier looked genuinely stunned.

Lucy blinked innocently. "No rule against it."

She shrugged. "Took a shot in the dark. Worked better than expected."

An awed silence fell.

[OMG! This is next-level genius!]
[Queen Lucy playing 4D chess out here!]
[Other teams are still clue-hunting while she's monetizing intel]
[The sheer IQ gap is brutal]
[LMAO their faces! Priceless!]
[Classic Lucy—always innovating]
[11/10 would watch again]

Asher finally choked out, "Lucy, I bow to you."

Jasper silently raised both thumbs.

Xavier rubbed his temples. "I yield."

Lucy's grin turned razor-sharp. "Oh, this is just the beginning."

Outside, the setting sun bathed the apocalyptic city in blood-red light.
###Chapter 269: Absolute Genius Move

"Holy shit!" Someone in the lab blurted out.

In front of the surveillance screens, the entire research team gaped in disbelief. One person even spilled coffee all over their keyboard.

"That girl..." The middle-aged team leader adjusted his glasses. "She actually thought to negotiate with the system?"

Ethan Smith chuckled, shoulders shaking. "Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant."

"Should we patch this loophole?" someone timidly suggested.

"Patch nothing!" The team leader slammed the table. "This is what we call innovative thinking!"

Ethan nodded. "Exactly. The competition rules never said anything about buying and selling clues."

The other researchers exchanged glances, silently noting down this newly discovered exploit.

Meanwhile, Lucy White's teammates were practically bouncing in their seats with excitement.

"One point per team?" Asher York counted on his fingers. "Thirty teams means thirty points!"

Xavier Boone adjusted his glasses. "That's a conservative estimate."

Jasper King slapped his thigh. "We're rich!"

Finn Wallace glanced at Lucy through the rearview mirror while speeding down the road. "Lucy, is your brain made of diamonds or something?"

Lucy lounged lazily in her seat. "You guys are just too honest."

"So what now?" Finn asked. "Ambush them?"

"No." Lucy narrowed her eyes. "Let the fish come to us."

Xavier immediately caught on. "Settle in first, then spread the word."

"Smart." Lucy snapped her fingers.

Just then, a military announcement crackled over the radio—they were establishing a survivor base.

Lucy's eyes lit up. "Head to the military zone."

"Huh?" Asher blinked in confusion.

But Xavier already understood. "Kill two birds with one stone."

They could earn goodwill points while using the broadcast to advertise their services.

Jasper gasped in realization. "Lucy, you're a freaking genius!"

The livestream chat exploded:

[OMG this move!]
[Who called Lucy just a pretty face? Come say that again!]
[How's that humble pie tasting, haters?]
[From today, I'm officially a Lucy stan!]
[Her IQ just outplayed the entire competition!]

Outside, zombies howled. Inside the car, laughter filled the air.

"Chopping with a cleaver makes my arms sore," Jasper complained, shaking his wrist.

Asher chewed on a toothpick. "Would be nice to get a gun."

Lucy shot him down. "Dream on."

Then she smirked. "But... we could try our luck at the armory."

Their eyes instantly gleamed with anticipation.

The armored SUV executed a perfect drift through the horde of zombies, speeding toward the military zone.
###Chapter 270: Lucy White is Unbelievably Uncanny

The military jeep jolted along the pothole-ridden road, turning what should have been a twenty-minute trip into over an hour before reaching the temporary rescue outpost.

"We're here." Xavier Boone slammed the brakes, tires carving deep grooves in the mud.

The perimeter had been cleared of zombies, armed soldiers patrolling behind barbed wire fences. Scattered survivors arrived in small groups, all covered in grime with terror in their eyes.

"Name?" A soldier at the registration desk asked without looking up.

Lucy White slung her machete over one shoulder. "Lucy White."

The soldier's head snapped up, scanning the five of them—their clean clothes and high-grade weapons starkly different from the usual refugees.

"Are you heading to the base or—"

"Here to assist." Xavier cut in.

The soldier's pen paused mid-air. This was the first volunteer team today.

"Perfect!" He scribbled on the form. "We're critically understaffed—your timing couldn't be better."

Handing over a crumpled temporary pass, he added apologetically, "Supplies are tight. You'll have to use your own gear."

Xavier took the slip, casually asking, "The armory depots—"

"Don't even ask." The soldier grimaced. "Every suburban location is swarmed."

In the rest area, Ethan Smith leaned against the wall with closed eyes. Lucy flipped her dagger, the blade dancing between her fingers.

"Get some sleep," she murmured. "We've got hell to face in an hour."

Meanwhile, Central Plaza was engulfed in smoke.

"Left flank! Secure the left!" A blond team leader screamed hoarsely as his squad got pushed back by the zombie tide.

They were the third team to get slaughtered here today.

"Damn it! Where's the damn clue?" Someone kicked over a trash can in frustration.

Only after nightfall did another team have a revelation—they smashed into a music store and returned hauling giant speakers.

"It's on the monument!" A member pointed at faint carvings.

When they finally fought their way out battered, the live comments exploded:

[Team Lucy finds clues like shopping while others look like they're fighting for their lives!]

[Rewatched ten times—Lucy cracked that cipher in 87 seconds!]

[Other teams are dying and they're napping??]

[That newsstand map is totally setting something up. Waiting for Lucy to rack up points.]

In the production control room, the director gaped at real-time rankings. "Seventh place? This scoring system needs an upgrade."

Elsewhere, Lily Green hurled her tablet against the wall.

"Impossible!" She glared at Lucy's sleeping profile, nails digging into her palms.

What shattered her completely was Fiona Von being shoved into a police car—the evidence chain Hunter Wilde provided was airtight, leaving even the Von family no choice but to disown their daughter.

"Lucy White..." Lily seethed at the livestream. "What kind of monster are you?"

As night deepened, searchlights from the outpost cut through the darkness. Lucy turned over, a ghost of a smile curling her lips.

The real show was just beginning.
###Chapter 271: Lucy's Leisurely Rescue Mission

The scorching sun blazed overhead as Lucy White lounged lazily on a bench in the rest area, a lollipop dangling from her lips.

"Fall in!"

A crisp male voice rang out. A young officer in tactical gear strode forward, his insignia glinting under the sunlight.

Xavier Boone immediately stood at attention. "Sir, we're here to assist with the rescue operation."

Lieutenant Leo's sharp gaze swept over the group, pausing noticeably when it landed on Lucy.

"I'm Lieutenant Leo, team leader for this mission," he said firmly. "If you're joining us, you follow orders."

Lucy rose leisurely, brushing nonexistent dust off her clothes.

"I'll tag along," she chirped, as if announcing a shopping trip.

Leo's brow furrowed. "This isn't a field trip. It's dangerous."

"Relax~" She waved her lollipop. "I promise not to cause trouble."

Xavier quickly interjected, "Lucy's got skills. We'll watch her back."

Skeptical but pressed for time, Leo gave a curt nod.

In the parking lot, two military vehicles stood ready.

"You ride shotgun," Leo pointed to the armored SUV.

Lucy's eyes lit up. "Thanks, Lieutenant~"

She hopped in with effortless grace, waving cheerfully at the teammates piling into the truck.

Asher York muttered under his breath, "Pretty privilege strikes again..."

The convoy rolled out of the base, navigating the ruins of the city.

"Alert! Zombie horde at three o'clock!"

The walkie-talkie crackled with urgent warnings.

Leo ordered an immediate halt, leading the charge with his squad.

Lucy remained obediently in her seat, even helpfully rolling down the window. "Go get 'em~"

[LMAO is Lucy here as a cheerleader?]
[Everyone's sweating bullets fighting zombies while she's just snacking]
[Lieutenant Leo: Why did I agree to bring this troublemaker?]

The skirmish ended quickly.

Leo returned panting, accepting the water bottle Lucy handed him.

"Thanks." He hesitated. "Maybe... I should have someone escort you back to base?"

Lucy blinked innocently. "But I want to help."

"You—" Leo swallowed his words as the walkie-talkie suddenly blared:

"Emergency! Research team trapped in the lab! Immediate extraction required!"

With a resigned sigh, Leo hit the gas.

Lucy smiled faintly, unwrapping another lollipop.

The real show was just beginning.
###Chapter 272: The Genius Hacker?

The lab was only twenty minutes from the base—the exact reason command had assigned Lieutenant Leo's team for the extraction mission.

"Lieutenant, what's the situation at the lab?" Corporal Wang asked from the passenger seat.

Leo's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. "Zombie horde. They're swarming the perimeter."

"Command wants us to evacuate the research team intact."

A sharp inhale came from the backseat. "Wasn't the lab sealed with biometric locks?"

"It was." Leo floored the accelerator. "Unless they cracked the codes..." His voice dropped. "Worst part? The only admin who knew the passwords turned."

Silence filled the vehicle. That lab housed the only viable research against the zombie virus.

Thirty minutes later, the convoy arrived at the scene.

Gunfire and guttural snarls clashed in the air. Hundreds of undead were battering against the lab's outer walls.

"Lock and load!" Leo grabbed his walkie-talkie.

Static crackled before a hoarse order came through: pincer maneuver in ten.

He turned to Lucy White. "Stay in the truck."

She arched an eyebrow. "I can help."

"This isn't a game." His frown deepened. "There's at least three hundred hostiles out there."

"Do I look like deadweight to you?" Lucy's smile turned icy.

Leo gave her a once-over. "Yes."

Live comments exploded:
[Ultimate toxic masculinity!]
[Show him what you got, Lucy!]
[Popcorn ready for this humble pie moment]

Lucy's lips curled. "Actually, I'm a hacker."

"Seriously?" Leo's expression said he'd rather believe in flying pigs.

"I can restore the lab's surveillance system." She wiggled her tablet.

The squad exchanged skeptical glances.

"Let her try," Corporal Wang muttered. "What's the harm?"

After a tense pause, Leo keyed his radio.

Five minutes later, lab personnel responded: proceed with caution.

"Stick close." Leo shoved a handgun at her with obvious reluctance. "Don't slow us down."

Lucy chuckled. "Better prepare your apology, Lieutenant."

When the assault began, no one noticed the faint blue glint in her eyes.
###Chapter 273: You Underestimated Her This Time

The ten-minute deadline was approaching when Lieutenant Leo spotted flashlight signals flashing in the distance.

"Everyone, out!" he commanded in a low voice. "Prepare to move!"

Finn Wallace watched as the team retrieved firearms from the trunk, his eyes widening.

"Can we get guns too?" he asked eagerly, rubbing his hands together.

Hacking zombies with knives was downright uncivilized—especially during a livestream.

Lieutenant Leo shook his head firmly. "Sorry, limited supplies."

After a pause, he added, "Once the mission's done, I'll put in a request for you."

These newcomers were still unvetted—no way he was handing out weapons recklessly.

Finn sighed in disappointment. "Fine. Don’t forget to request them, okay?"

Then Lucy White spoke up. "Can I at least have one for self-defense?"

She was done swinging that ridiculous machete.

Lieutenant Leo hesitated before handing her a pistol. "Watch the trigger. Stick close and only fire if necessary."

Finn’s jaw dropped. "Hey! I thought we were short on gear?"

Lieutenant Leo didn’t flinch. "She needs protection."

"Sexist much?" Finn protested.

"Call it what you want." Leo checked his watch. "Move out!"

"Go!"

At his signal, multiple squads surged forward from different directions.

Gunfire erupted. Blades flashed.

Finn and his team had no choice but to keep hacking away at zombies.

Lucy didn’t charge ahead. Instead, she stood guard, pistol ready.

Every time a teammate was cornered, she’d take the shot—bullseye, every time.

Bang!

Another zombie dropped mid-lunge.

The rescued soldier turned, stunned to see an unfamiliar beauty holding the smoking gun.

Leo fought back-to-back with his men when a sneaky zombie lunged from the side.

"Look out!" he shouted.

A single bullet punched through the zombie’s skull just in time.

"Thanks," the shaken soldier nodded at Lucy.

Only then did Leo realize—her aim was terrifyingly precise.

"Boss, you misjudged her," a teammate muttered. "That’s sniper-level accuracy."

Leo immediately radioed logistics. "Get her a rifle!"

With Lucy’s cover fire, the assault team plowed through like a storm.

An hour later, the horde was wiped out.

Miraculously, not a single soldier on the perimeter had fallen.

"Thank you!" The rescued team swarmed Lucy with gratitude.

Leo approached her and snapped a formal salute. "I misread you earlier. You saved us all."

Lucy smiled faintly. "Just doing my part."

"Your shooting—" Leo trailed off.

"Just a hobby," she said lightly.

His eye twitched. "..."

Finn and the others crowded around.

"Teach us, Lucy!" they begged.

She nodded. "Sure."

Leo cut in. "Surveillance team’s arriving soon. You ready?"

"Always," Lucy said confidently. "Won’t let you down."
###Chapter 274: Can She Do It?

The elevator doors chimed open ten minutes later.

A colonel with three silver stars on his epaulets strode out, flanked by two fully armed soldiers. Their combat boots clicked sharply against the tiled floor.

"Reporting, sir!" Lieutenant Leo snapped to attention with a crisp salute.

Colonel Parker returned the salute, his gaze piercing. "Mission accomplished well."

"Just doing my duty!" Leo's voice boomed.

The colonel gave a slight nod before turning to Lucy White standing nearby. "This must be Ms. White?"

Lucy stepped forward, lips curving. "Good to meet you, Colonel Parker."

Their handshake surprised the colonel—her slender fingers held unexpected strength.

"Surveillance room's on the seventh floor." Parker gestured. "Ready now?"

"Lead the way." Lucy's response was crisp.

Xavier Boone and his team fell in step automatically. Noticing this, Leo hurried to join them.

The colonel's mouth twitched imperceptibly as he observed the young group.

During the elevator ascent, Lucy's composed reflection showed in the metal walls. Her fingers tapped an unconscious rhythm against her thigh, as if simulating code entry.

The surveillance room's dark monitors stood out starkly.

Lucy went straight to the main console. Her hands hovered momentarily before dancing across the keyboard like butterflies in flight.

Lines of code cascaded down the screens.

"Virus purge in progress." She didn't look up. "System reboot in thirty-two minutes."

Colonel Parker narrowed his eyes. Her typing technique surpassed even their tech division's best programmer.

The minutes ticked by.

With a soft beep, all monitors flickered to life simultaneously.

"Holy shit!" someone blurted.

Over twenty camera feeds displayed crystal-clear images, down to the emergency lights in distant corridors.

The colonel lunged toward the screens.

Lab-coated researchers scrambled away from shambling zombies. One young scientist slumped against a wall, lips cracked and bleeding.

"The biometric locks..." Parker whirled toward Lucy. "Can you bypass them?"

The overhead lights reflected twin stars in Lucy's eyes.

"Take me there."

Sublevel Three. A silver door gleamed coldly.

Lucy pressed her palm against the scanner. After three seconds, her eyes closed, then she smiled.

"Give me five minutes."

Live comments exploded:
[Here it comes! Lucy's gonna show off!]
[Full marks for that dramatic flair!]
[Five minutes? Military experts couldn't crack it in three days!]
[Popcorn ready! Waiting for the big reveal!]

The lock clicked.

Everyone held their breath.

(To be continued)
###Chapter 275: Lucy Never Disappoints

A soft click echoed as Lucy White's fingertip traced the final arc across the control panel.

The laboratory plunged into dead silence.

Everyone held their breath, eyes locked on the supposedly "impenetrable" silver door.

Finn Wallace swallowed hard. "Lu, you really think this'll—"

Before he could finish, a mechanical female voice announced: "Biometric lock disengaged. Opening sequence initiated."

WHOOM.

The massive metal door slid apart.

Lucy already had her pistol drawn before the mechanism finished grinding.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Three lunging zombies collapsed mid-leap.

Colonel Parker's pupils constricted. He'd clocked it—Lucy's draw had preceded the door's opening by 0.3 seconds.

"How did—" Lieutenant Leo began, then bit back his question.

Lucy flicked her ponytail. "Those three have been pacing outside for thirty minutes on the surveillance feed."

Understanding dawned on the group.

The livestream exploded.

[WTF that prediction!]
[Lucy GOAT!]
[That reaction time ain't human!]

Colonel Parker gripped Lucy's shoulder, voice thick. "Miss White, you just saved humanity's last hope."

From the lab's depths came frantic footsteps. Three white-coated researchers stumbled into view, collapsing at the sight of armed rescuers.

"Dr. Roland?" The colonel's tone turned urgent.

The eldest researcher pointed down the corridor. "S-safe room... 104° fever..."

Lucy was already sprinting past them.

The safe room required palm-print authorization. When the door retracted, the entire team gasped.

A golden-haired man curled in the corner, his flushed skin alarmingly crimson. His lab coat clung to sweat-drenched shoulders, vomit staining the floor nearby.

"Move!" The colonel barked.

Lucy knelt, producing a glass vial of fever reducer from her pack. The medicine glinted coldly under fluorescent lights.

"You packed that?" Finn gaped.

She snapped the cap open. "Pharmacy raid payoff."

As the liquid touched Dr. Roland's lips, his eyelids fluttered.

The colonel exhaled sharply, personally hoisting the unconscious scientist. Before leaving, he bowed deeply to Lucy.

"Move out," Lieutenant Leo ordered, checking his magazine. "Three sectors left to—"

DING.

Every wrist display flashed crimson.

[MAIN QUEST ACTIVATED: DR. ROLAND'S ENCRYPTED DRIVE]
[WARNING: THIS DECIDES YOUR FINAL FATE]

Lucy's eyes narrowed toward a blinking red light in the lab's recesses.

There, smeared with bloody handprints, stood a secure vault.
###Chapter 276: Simply Unmatched

Lucy White and her team stared at the short message on their holoscreens, deep in thought.

"Looks like we got lucky this time," Asher York grinned. "No need to run around the whole city like last time."

Finn Wallace fiddled with his communicator. "Just checked with friends from other teams. They're still stuck on the first clue."

"That slow?" Asher raised an eyebrow.

"Yep," Finn shrugged. "Zombies are piling up over there, and they don't have Lucy's brains. Still circling that stone monument."

Jasper King chimed in, "Heard only about thirty teams have cracked the first clue so far."

"We're about to pull way ahead," Finn rubbed his hands excitedly. "But first, let's find the clue here."

All three turned expectantly toward Lucy and Xavier Boone.

Xavier sighed. "Planning to sit this one out?"

"We handle the fighting," Finn declared without shame.

Xavier looked at Lucy. "Any ideas?"

"I need to recall the surveillance room footage," Lucy said.

Xavier blinked. "You remember all those screens?"

"Yeah," Lucy nodded. "But I'll need time to sort it out."

Xavier's mouth twitched. "That memory of yours... I caught some of it too. Let's brainstorm."

The two found separate spots to sit and closed their eyes in concentration.

[LMAO the goof squad getting outsmarted again]
[Someone calculate their trauma levels]
[Lucy OP!]
[International viewers are shook rn]

Twenty minutes later, Lucy opened her eyes first.

"Got something?" Xavier asked.

"There was a box with Chinese writing," Lucy said.

Xavier's eyes lit up. "I saw that too! But couldn't place it."

"Follow me." Lucy stood and led the way.

After several turns, the group stopped before an archive room.

"Here." Lucy pointed to a corner shelf.

Finn's eyes widened. "No freaking way!"

Xavier lifted the metal box, impressed. "You remembered the route too?"

"Surveillance feeds form a map when pieced together," Lucy said casually.

Three thumbs shot up in unison: "Lucy's a legend!"

[Human GPS living up to the name]
[That memory is insane]
[Someone tell Michael he's not worthy]

Finn suddenly turned serious. "From today, you're my blood sister!"

Asher and Jasper nodded vigorously. "We're not worthy."

Lucy shook her head with a smile. "Enough flattery. Let's see what's in the box."
###Chapter 277: A Genius Wasted in Showbiz

The livestream chat exploded instantly.

"Holy crap! Is Lucy White's brain a supercomputer?"
"Her spatial reconstruction skills are insane!"
"Mom asked why I'm watching this on my knees..."

Official accounts from major research institutions suddenly flooded the comments.

[National Academy of Sciences]: @Lucy White Consider switching to STEM? Starting salary seven figures.

[Defense Tech]: Hands off! We need this spatial modeling talent!

The chat went wild:
"LMAO this talent war!"
"Lucy: I just joined a competition and suddenly everyone wants me?"

The International AI Lab dropped the ultimate offer:
[Formal invitation for Ms. White to join our 6D holographic project team. Compensation negotiable.]

Viewers were stunned:
"What kind of plot twist is this?"
"Did Lucy accidentally pick up the protagonist's script?"

Meanwhile in the lab, Lucy slid the metal case toward Xavier Boone.
"Your turn with the cipher lock."

Xavier raised an eyebrow. "Passing the baton?"
"Specialist job for the specialist." Lucy winked. "Consider it your spotlight moment."

The chat erupted again:
"Queen of delegation!"
"I ship this teamwork so hard!"

Two hours later.

A soft click signaled the lock's surrender.
Asher York immediately applauded. "Sick skills, X!"
"Decent." Xavier wiped his brow, glancing at Lucy. "Your mid-process hints saved me."

Lucy waved it off. "You did the heavy lifting."

A golden moderator message flashed across the screen:
[This skill level qualifies for National Security clearance!]

Only then did viewers notice multiple government accounts spectating.

"So..." Asher said drily, "exactly how many legends are hiding on our team?"

The chat lost it:
"Asher realizing he's the comic relief"
"Rename the show 'Undercover Geniuses' already"
###Chapter 278: That Move Was Brilliant

Lucy White didn’t hold back in praising Xavier Boone’s performance, and the others nodded in agreement.

A faint smile appeared on Xavier’s handsome face. "Getting praised by you, Lucy, is sweeter than honey."

He knew full well that Lucy’s skills far surpassed his own.

When he was cracking the code earlier, he had appeared calm and composed, but his palms were sweating.

Thankfully, Lucy had subtly given him a crucial hint during her explanation.

Otherwise, it would have taken him at least two more hours to solve it.

Lucy’s eyes curved into crescents. "So my praise is that effective? I’ll have to compliment you more often then."

Finn Wallace immediately leaned in. "Hey, we need praise too!"

"Yeah, yeah, we’ve got our strong points too," Asher York and Jasper King chimed in, not wanting to be left out.

Lucy agreed readily. "Fine, I’ll make sure to point out your good sides from now on."

Compliments were free, after all.

She pointed at the metal box. "Now hurry up and see what’s inside."

Only then did the group remember their main objective and crowded around. "Right, right—let’s check the clue."

Xavier opened the box, and a beam of light projected into the air.

A virtual panel materialized midair, text appearing line by line.

Lucy reacted instantly, pulling out her phone to start recording.

The others: "..." That move was downright brilliant.

Their first instinct had been to activate their watches’ audio recording function.

Who would’ve guessed the clue would be displayed as text this time?

Their watches could only record sound, not video—leaving them staring helplessly.

Lucy’s reflexes were just unreal.

Finn lowered his voice. "Where did you even get a phone?"

Lucy replied casually, "Found it on the street earlier. Figured even without a signal, other functions might come in handy."

"And it did." She had a habit of collecting anything potentially useful.

Finn and the others exchanged glances before giving her a thumbs-up. "Lucy, you never disappoint."

"This clue’s gonna sell for good money," they muttered excitedly, rubbing their hands together.

Lucy blinked. "Keep it to yourselves."

They immediately mimed zipping their lips. "Got it!"

[LMAO Lucy’s move was next-level]

[The others were completely caught off guard—who would’ve thought a phone could be used like that?]

[I wondered why she picked it up earlier—she was playing 4D chess]

[Organizers: We’ve been outsmarted]

[Lucy’s on a mission to break the game at this point]

The live chat was in stitches, a stark contrast to the streams from other countries, which were flooded with complaints.

Back home, the higher-ups watching the broadcast were thoroughly pleased with Lucy’s performance.

Once the panel vanished, Xavier summarized, "The clue says the apocalypse was man-made."

"Someone deliberately released the zombie virus and triggered mutations in plants and animals."

"Our mission is to find that person and retrieve either the virus formula or an antidote."

"The catch? This is a prerequisite for the main quest."

"If we fail this, all our previous points become void."

Asher frowned. "That’s way too difficult."

Finn sighed. "Finding the mastermind among so many people? Like finding a needle in a haystack."

Jasper groaned. "The organizers are ruthless—this is insane."

Xavier mused, "The real problem is we have no other leads."

Finn wailed, "How are we supposed to finish this in a month?"

Asher gave a bitter laugh. "Is this even playable?"

But Lucy was practically glowing with excitement. "That’s what makes it fun. Too easy would be boring."

"If anyone could do it, why call it Hell Mode?"

It had been ages since she’d faced a challenge this thrilling.

Finn and the others: "..." They felt personally attacked.

Finn couldn’t help saying, "Lucy, if other teams heard that, they’d want to punch you."

Jasper added, "Seriously, don’t say that in front of them—it’s instant hate magnet."

If Lucy weren’t so pretty, even they might’ve been tempted to throw hands.

Not that they were actually dumb—they just paled in comparison to these two.

Lucy rolled her eyes. "Sounds like you’re talking about yourselves."

Finn quickly waved his hands. "No way, you’re our treasure."

The others hurried to agree. "Yeah, yeah, we’re always on your side."

The last thing they wanted was to get wrecked by Lucy before the real challenge even began.
###Chapter 279: Lucy's Keen Insight

To Finn Wallace and the others, Lucy White was nothing short of a godsend.

Who would have thought she'd be this capable, effortlessly carrying them to victory?

Honestly, their former teammate who had quit couldn't hold a candle to her.

Not that they looked down on their ex-teammate—it was just that stumbling upon Lucy felt like striking gold.

Now, they had to keep her happy. If she decided to bail, they'd be left with no one to turn to.

[LOL, the desperation from these three is practically oozing through the screen.]
[They're terrified of pissing off Lucy.]
[How dare they lay a hand on her? These guys have some nerve.]
[Gotta admit, I love Lucy's smug attitude.]
[Too easy would be boring. Only Lucy can humblebrag like this.]

Xavier Boone wholeheartedly agreed with Lucy's assessment.

"True. If it's too simple, it works against us. A challenge makes it exciting."

If he were still leading a team of three on his own, he'd have given up at this difficulty level.

But with Lucy—whose intellect outclassed everyone else—they actually stood a chance.

Finn rolled his eyes and slung an arm around Xavier's shoulders. "Damn, Boone. You're getting bold."

Asher York teased, "That's what happens when you roll with Lucy. You start talking big."

Lucy sighed. "Alright, enough."

Ignoring their banter, Xavier turned to her. "What's next?"

Though he was the captain, he'd grown accustomed to deferring to her judgment.

Lucy pondered for a moment. "We already have a crucial lead right in front of us."

"What lead?" the three asked in unison.

"Dr. Roland's lab."

"The fact that the final clue is here is a major hint in itself."

"Don't forget—this is a top-tier biomedical research facility, staffed by the brightest minds in the field."

She paused. "Lieutenant Leo kept emphasizing that Dr. Roland's team was the most likely to crack the zombie virus."

"Flip that around—they're also the most likely to have created it."

"It's just a theory, but I think we should explore this angle."

Her words were like a lightbulb moment for the group.

Of course—those who could cure the virus could just as easily have engineered it.

And the fact that the production crew planted the clue here? That was practically a neon sign.

Lucy was always the sharpest.

Xavier had sensed something off but couldn't pinpoint it until now.

"Lucy's logic is solid. Unless the crew is deliberately misleading us, the virus probably originated here."

Finn and the others nodded. "Let's dig for more clues."

They split up, ostensibly helping Lieutenant Leo search for survivors while secretly gathering intel.

Lucy and Xavier stayed behind, quickly scanning the bookshelves before inspecting the lab equipment and materials.

Lucy made sure to thoroughly examine the private room where Dr. Roland had been found.

Before long, Lieutenant Leo returned.

He was noticeably more respectful toward Lucy now. "Lucy, we're heading back. You done here?"

Earlier, she'd claimed exhaustion and asked to rest in the lab.

Lucy slid the notebook she'd been reading back onto the desk. "Yeah, let's go."

As they left, Leo locked the lab doors per his superiors' orders.

With Lucy around, getting back in wouldn't be an issue.

Still, the lab housed critical research that needed safeguarding.

Before departing, Colonel Parker had privately instructed Leo to keep a close eye on Lucy's team, ensuring they didn't access sensitive equipment.

They were still unknowns—caution was necessary.

Lucy and Xavier had deliberately avoided guarded archives and untouched devices during their search, a discretion that eased Leo's concerns.

As long as they weren't after classified intel, it was fine.

On the return trip, Leo rewarded Lucy's team with seats in the armored SUV.

Xavier seized the opportunity. "Is Dr. Roland okay now?"

Leo sighed in relief. "His fever broke. Thank God we got there in time."

Since it wasn't classified, he answered honestly.

Xavier nodded. "Losing him would've been a huge blow to humanity."

"How many casualties in the lab?"

Leo grimaced. "About a third. Only a few turned initially, but many more got infected from bites."

Xavier probed further. "Anyone leave the lab before the outbreak?"

Unaware of the fishing expedition, Leo replied, "A few were on leave. They're fine."

"Lucky them," Xavier remarked, mentally filing the intel.

He swiftly changed the subject before Leo could grow suspicious.

###Chapter 280: Escalating Survival Crisis

The convoy didn't return to their original outpost, heading straight for the Safe Haven under construction instead. In the darkness, their headlights became beacons drawing the undead.

"Watch out! Three o'clock!" Lieutenant Leo barked.

Lucy White steadied her sniper rifle and pulled the trigger. The bullet pierced a zombie's skull with perfect precision.

"Nice shot!" The soldier in the passenger seat gave her a thumbs-up.

Just two kilometers from the base, disaster struck.

A scream tore through the night.

Everyone turned to see a soldier entangled in thick, gnarled branches, being dragged toward a grotesquely twisted tree. A horrifying human face had formed on its trunk.

"Open fire!" Leo ordered.

Bullets rained down but barely scratched the bark.

Lucy narrowed her eyes, her scope locking onto a pulsating crimson node at the tree's core.

Bang!

Her shot struck true. The tree shrieked as its branches withered instantly, dropping the soldier to the ground.

"What...what kind of monster is that?" someone stammered.

Lucy jumped out, her combat boots crunching dead branches. She crouched, dipping her fingers into the oozing sap.

"The virus has reached the plant kingdom." Her face was grim in the moonlight. "Animals are next."

Leo swallowed hard. "Is there any hope left for us?"

"Of course." Lucy clapped him on the shoulder. "We survived the dinosaurs. We'll survive this too."

The convoy moved on in heavy silence. Everyone knew—the rules of survival had just changed.

At dawn, Leo brought steaming soy milk and meat buns.

"Command approved your reward." He handed over a list. "Pick what you want."

Lucy checked off housing and supplies, then scribbled an encrypted radio message.

"Looking for someone?" Leo raised an eyebrow.

"Lost teammates." She shrugged. "Any missions today?"

Leo smirked. "Big operation this afternoon. We need pros like you."

Outside, a flock of mutated crows darkened the sky. The real fight for survival had only just begun.
###Chapter 281: Is This Even Fun Anymore?

The moment Lieutenant Leo left, Finn Wallace and the others crowded around Lucy White.

"What mission do you think they'll assign us this afternoon?" Asher York rubbed his hands together eagerly.

Lucy twirled a keychain around her finger. "Probably sending us to crack the biometric lock on the armory depot."

With mutated zombies, flora, and fauna posing a triple threat, the Safe Haven needed weapons more than ever.

Only fools would leave an armory untouched.

"Finally! We can ditch these crappy kitchen knives!" Finn high-fived his teammates in excitement.

Xavier Boone delivered a cold dose of reality: "Dream on. The depot needs Lucy's lockpicking skills, not you noobs."

Their enthusiasm deflated instantly.

Was this world even fair? They couldn't even get proper weapons?

"Lucy..." The trio turned pleading eyes on her, like three hungry puppies begging for scraps.

Amused, Lucy chuckled. "Fine, I'll put in a word for you."

"You're the best!" They immediately perked up.

She rolled her eyes. "Who's your 'bro'? I'm a certified beauty, thank you very much."

The group fell silent.

Beautiful? Absolutely. But after witnessing her dismantle zombies barehanded, who would dare treat her like some delicate girl?

A goddess of her caliber was meant to be admired from afar—never trifled with.

Asher quickly changed the subject. "Think anyone will come to buy intel today?"

"Patience," Xavier adjusted his glasses. "Once they hit enough dead ends, they'll come crawling to us."

Lucy nodded in agreement.

With the base on high alert, they decided to lounge in their quarters.

"So bored..." Finn sprawled on the couch. "Wish we could game."

"Then let's game." Lucy waved a phone. "Those we scavenged from the lab should have some installed."

"No signal, remember?" Jasper King looked baffled.

With a mysterious smile, Lucy pulled out her laptop and typed furiously.

Five minutes later.

"Done." She tossed the phones back.

Finn opened a game and nearly dropped his jaw. "Holy—! You turned single-player into LAN mode? What kind of sorcery is this?"

"Basic skills. No need to worship." Lucy calmly selected her hero.

A 3v3 match began.

Finn puffed his chest. "Not to brag, but we three are top-tier ranked!"

Five matches later.

"Mercy, oh great one!" Finn wailed, clinging to Lucy's leg. "A support getting a pentakill? Since when is that a thing?"

The livestream chat exploded:
[LMAO Finn's whole worldview just shattered]
[Queen Lucy: Surprise, I was pro-gamer]
[Worst gaming experience ever.jpg]

At the start of the sixth round, Jasper looked ready to cry. "Lucy, give us a fighting chance?"

She smirked. "Call me 'Daddy' and I'll go easy."

"Daddy!" They chorused instantly.

Asher nearly fell off the couch laughing.

This game was officially unplayable.
###Chapter 282: The eSports Queen Arrives

Finn and his two teammates gaped at Lucy's lightning-fast keyboard movements.

"Holy crap! How many years of being single did it take to develop that kind of APM?" Asher's jaw dropped as he watched Lucy's flawless in-game maneuvers.

Lucy's fingers danced across the keyboard without missing a beat. "Focus on your jungle camps. Stop feeding."

The moment she spoke, Finn's screen turned gray.

"Damn it, Lucy! That's brutal!" Finn slammed his desk in frustration. "I thought you were going easy on us!"

A faint smirk appeared on Lucy's lips. "This is what we call tactical mercy. Got it?"

When the next round began, Finn barely respawned before Lucy comboed him into oblivion.

"Seriously, are you a pro player in disguise?" Finn groaned.

Lucy casually cleared the jungle camps. "Just killing time."

"Killing time?" Asher stared at his 0-5 score. "That's some next-level humblebragging!"

The livestream chat exploded:

[OMG! Those mechanics are insane!]
[Teach me, sensei! I'll be your hype man!]
[Actual pros would cry watching this]
[From today onward, I'm Lucy's #1 fangirl!]

Jasper peeked at the match stats and silently pulled out his phone. "Friend request sent."

After three consecutive losses, Finn finally cracked. "Mercy, please! I was wrong to show off in front of you!"

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "Now you remember who's boss?"

"Boss!" The trio chorused in surrender.

Meanwhile, teams from other countries were being chased through streets by hordes of zombies.

"What the hell? The Chinese team is still gaming?" A foreign captain smashed his communicator after seeing the livestream footage.

"They partnered with the military?!" Another team nearly popped their eyes out watching Lucy's squad board an armored vehicle.

Lieutenant Leo stared dumbfounded at Lucy's rapid code modifications.

"Miss White, we need your expertise," he said nervously.

Without looking up, Lucy replied, "Armory biometric locks?"

"How did—" Leo's eyes widened.

"Lucky guess. What's my cut?"

"Take your pick from the arsenal!"

"Deal." Lucy snapped her laptop shut and winked at her team. "Let's go shopping for some premium gear."

As their military convoy passed through the city gates, they encountered two battered foreign teams.

"How are they..." The foreign competitors nearly wept comparing Lucy's relaxed squad to their own bloodied, exhausted state.

The disparity was downright unfair.
###Chapter 283: Predators Preying on Predators

"Beep—" The horn of the military armored SUV blared at the base entrance.

Two foreign teams turned simultaneously, just in time to see the Chinese squad emerging alongside armed forces personnel. Their eyes gleamed with recognition—the special broadcast announcement hadn't escaped their notice.

"Captain Boone!" The blond team leader strode forward, intercepting Xavier Boone before he could board the vehicle. "A word?"

The brunet leader from the rival team closed in. "We've got questions too."

Xavier exchanged a glance with Lucy White before turning with a diplomatic smile. "Of course."

The three teams formed an uneasy triangle at the gates.

"That's Lieutenant Leo, isn't it?" The blond leader nodded toward the SUV. "Running an op?"

Xavier confirmed with a tilt of his head. "Just assisting with a minor military request."

"The broadcast mentioned you found the second clue?" The brunet cut to the chase. "Where's Professor Roland's lab?"

Finn Wallace muffled a snicker behind them until Lucy's elbow found his ribs.

"We did locate it." Xavier produced a folded slip from his pocket. "However..."

Every rival operative leaned forward.

"Let's make a deal." He waved the paper. "One point for the lab's coordinates. Two points for the actual clue."

Silence descended for three heartbeats.

"You're joking." The blond leader's eyes widened. "Points are transferable?"

Xavier's smile turned cryptic. "The system confirmed it. Just initiate the transfer via captain's watch."

The rival teams immediately huddled, voices rising in heated debate. Lucy leaned against the SUV, watching their flushed faces with quiet amusement.

"Deal!" Both teams ultimately opted for the one-point intel.

Xavier accepted their point transfers and handed over the note with a "helpful" addendum: "Fair warning—the lab's got a biometric lock. Might need... specialized skills."

The rivals departed in high spirits. The moment they disappeared, Finn exploded with laughter. "Captain, that's brutal! Even the military couldn't crack that lock—"

"Business strategy," Lucy corrected coolly. "When they hit that dead end, they'll return for the real clue."

Lieutenant Leo revved the engine. "Move out! We need to reach the armory before nightfall!"

The convoy rolled through apocalyptic streets—cars strewn like broken toys, zombies shambling through rubble. Every few hundred meters required stopping to clear roadblocks.

"Ping!" A stray bullet ricocheted off their window.

"Ambush!" Leo wrenched the steering wheel.

Lucy rolled down her window and fired in one fluid motion. A distant scream preceded a body tumbling from a rooftop.

"Push through!" Leo floored the accelerator.

By the time the armory's silhouette appeared, full darkness had fallen. Moonlight glinted off the reinforced concrete structure—a slumbering behemoth awaiting their arrival.

"Here." Leo killed the engine, turning to Lucy. "Your show now."

Lucy flexed her fingers, studying the intricate electronic lock glowing coldly under the moon. "Leave it to me."
###Chapter 284: More Trustworthy

The night was pitch black. As soon as the modified SUVs came to a stop, a dense swarm of zombies surged toward them.

"Prepare to deploy explosives!" Lieutenant Leo barked into the walkie-talkie.

Several deafening explosions rocked the area, flames shooting into the sky. The blast wave sent dozens of zombies flying, their mangled limbs scattering across the ground.

"Move out!" Leo was the first to leap from the vehicle, his submachine gun spitting fire.

Lucy White nimbly climbed onto the roof of the SUV and steadied her sniper rifle. Peering through the night vision scope, she narrowed one eye.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Every shot struck a zombie squarely between the eyes. In the darkness, her precision was terrifying.

"That girl..." Leo caught a glimpse of her silhouette on the roof and couldn't help but marvel.

Half an hour later, the last zombie collapsed.

"Get inside, now!" Leo signaled urgently.

The outer door of the armory depot had already been pried open, its perimeter weapons looted clean.

"Looks like someone beat us here," Lucy remarked, kicking aside spent bullet casings.

The group moved swiftly for another thirty minutes before stopping before a massive metal door.

"This is it." Leo pointed to the center. "The biometric lock is hidden behind here."

Lucy stepped forward, her fingers gliding over the cold metal surface. With a click, a concealed panel slid open.

"How long will it take?" Leo asked, tense.

"Hard to say." Lucy deliberately furrowed her brow. "This system's more complex than the lab's."

Her fingers flew across the interface, lines of code cascading down the screen. In truth, she could crack it in ten minutes—but she chose to stall.

Beep—Access granted. You have ten minutes to enter.

The electronic voice made Leo nearly jump with excitement.

"We're in!" He slapped his thigh. "Lucy, you're a godsend!"

Lucy offered a faint smile. "Just a mutually beneficial arrangement."

She'd heard rumors about the newly established Safe Haven base recruiting aggressively. But compared to their flashy slogans, she trusted the military's ironclad discipline far more.

The metal door groaned open, revealing the staggering arsenal within.

"This much..." Leo inhaled sharply. Fighter jets and helicopters stood in orderly rows, and the ammunition depot stretched beyond sight.

"Gonna take half a month to haul all this back, huh?" Lucy arched an eyebrow.

Leo rubbed his hands together. "Well, yeah... Might have to trouble you for a few more trips..."

Lucy had expected this. Her time was precious—she couldn't afford to waste it.

"How about I rewrite the program? Give you permanent access," she suggested suddenly.

"Seriously?" Leo's eyes lit up. "What's your price?"

"More cash." Lucy was blunt. "Plus three crates of antibiotics."

Leo laughed. "Deal!"

He could already picture the look on those dissenters' faces. This mission was worth every penny.
###Chapter 285: Lucy's Master Plan

When Lucy White proposed resetting the system, she already had her payment demands calculated.

"I want a helicopter," she stated bluntly.

With a chopper, their operational efficiency would double.

Xavier Boone and the others' eyes lit up. Why hadn't they thought of that?

Lieutenant Leo looked slightly surprised. "I'll need to clear that with my superiors."

"No problem," Lucy replied, having anticipated this. "Also, we'll each need two firearms for protection."

"In exchange, you can call on me anytime you need my help in the future."

Leo agreed readily: "The guns I can authorize right now."

An hour later.

Inside the armory, Asher York cradled a brand-new sniper rifle like a treasure. "Lucy, you're a genius!"

Finn Wallace grinned foolishly at his chosen submachine gun.

Jasper King and Xavier Boone also found their dream weapons.

"Easy," Lucy said, twirling two sleek handguns. "Stick with me, and I'll make sure you live the good life."

The group chorused: "Damn right!"

[Live comments exploded]
[Ahhh I wanna touch guns too!]
[Lucy, need a sidekick? I have a college degree!]
[International fans joining the hype lol]

Leo returned with good news: "Command approved the helicopter."

Lucy arched a brow. "Then let's reset the system now."

Three hours later.

The system reboot completed. Leo successfully used his new clearance to open the secured doors.

"Thank you so much!" His voice shook with excitement.

Lucy waved him off. "I'm going to rest."

In a shadowy corridor corner late at night.

Two furtive figures conversed in an obscure dialect.

Lucy held her breath, listening intently.

[Live comments went wild]
[What are they saying?!]
[Oh no I can't understand!]
[Someone translate please I'm dying here!]

Knowledgeable viewers quickly translated the exchange.

Those who read the translation instantly panicked.

[Holy shit!]
[Lucy, run!]
[Something terrible's about to happen!]
###Chapter 286: The Art of Humblebragging

Lucy White pressed herself against the wall, her fingers lightly tapping the smartwatch on her wrist. As the recording indicator lit up, she held her breath.

In the darkness, two hushed voices drifted toward her in fragments. Her lashes fluttered slightly as she committed every syllable to memory.

Click.
The moment the recording ended, she darted into the shadows three meters away, swift as a cat.

[OMG that was close!]
[That guy literally drew his gun!]
The live comments exploded just as one of the soldiers suddenly halted. He whirled around, his weapon sweeping across the spot where Lucy had stood moments before.

Moonlight stretched his shadow long and thin, its edge barely grazing the darkness where Lucy hid.

Thirty seconds.
Sixty.
When the sound of combat boots finally faded, the livestream audience collectively exhaled.

"Found you." Xavier Boone's voice cut through the silence. He steadied Lucy as she stumbled, his palm icy against her arm.

Inside the tent, the recording played for the third time when Finn Wallace raked a hand through his disheveled hair. "This gibberish—"

"It's Taka, from the South Seas." Lucy paused the playback. "They said—"

With every word she translated, her teammates paled.

"Four a.m.?" Asher York's canteen hit the ground. "That's—"

"Two hours and forty-three minutes from now." Jasper King's voice tightened as he checked his watch.

All eyes turned to Lucy. She adjusted her firearm, her lashes casting faint shadows under her eyes.

"Lu—" Finn swallowed hard. "We—"

"Shh." Lucy raised a finger abruptly. "Listen."

The distant whir of mechanical gears echoed—the sound of the armory's biometric lock resetting its encryption.

A sudden smile curved her lips, moonlight catching in her dimples. "Now it's Lieutenant Leo who should be worried."

The tension shattered instantly. Jasper nudged her shoulder. "Seriously, how'd you understand that obscure language earlier?"

"Oh, that?" Lucy tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Is knowing a hundred-plus languages weird?"

"H-how many?" Jasper's tactical knife clattered to the ground.

The tent plunged into stunned silence. Five pairs of eyes widened like night-vision lenses.

"It's actually simple." Lucy loaded a magazine without looking up. "Just learn one per day, and in half a year—"

"Stop!" Jasper clutched his chest. "Is this the humblebrag of a genius?"

His exaggerated glare broke the tension. As Lucy tossed him a spare magazine, the livestream flooded with comments:

[Lucy! Taka language major here—there's a detail in that convo...]

But no one noticed. Because the first gunshot had already rung out in the distance.
###Chapter 287 Just the Beginning

When Lucy White's group arrived, Lieutenant Leo was preparing to rest.

He pushed open the tent flap and stepped out, frowning slightly. "What's wrong? It's late."

Lucy quickly explained the situation and played the recording from her watch.

Leo's expression darkened instantly, his knuckles cracking as he clenched his fists. "Those traitors!"

One was his deputy, the other an old comrade he'd worked with for years.

It suddenly struck him—the deputy's father had once led a group in defecting from the base. Clearly, they'd been colluding with enemy forces for a long time, poaching personnel.

Jasper King couldn't help interjecting, "You understand this language?"

Leo gave him a strange look. "Of course. It's the local dialect. You don't?"

Jasper: "..." He cursed the production crew a thousand times in his head.

This wasn't a dialect—it was a trap! Only locals could understand it.

He forced a laugh. "My family moved here later. I'm not familiar with it."

Leo eyed Lucy suspiciously and suddenly spoke a few sentences in the dialect.

Lucy responded effortlessly, conversing fluently.

Xavier Boone caught a few words, but Jasper and the others were completely lost.

Only then did Leo relax. With communications down after the apocalypse and no way to verify identities, he had to be cautious.

"I'll arrange an ambush. You all should rest." He nodded gratefully. "Thanks for the warning. Things could've gone badly."

If the armory and Lucy had been taken, he'd never be able to face his superiors again.

Lucy smiled faintly. "We're part of the base now too. Call us if you need help."

After a moment's thought, Leo handed them several military-grade walkie-talkies. "Use these to stay in touch."

It was a sign of official acceptance.

"Got it."

After tuning the frequencies, Lucy's group took their leave.

Finn Wallace twirled a walkie-talkie and whistled. "Damn, Lucy. Military comms? That's impressive."

This wasn't equipment just anyone could get.

Lucy arched a brow. "Didn't I promise to carry you? This is just the start."

"Lucy for the win!" Finn grinned. "We helping out later?"

"No need." She shook her head. "If they can't handle this much, they don't deserve to keep the armory."

Xavier nodded in agreement. "Internal cleanup isn't our business."

At most, there'd be negotiations tonight—no real fighting. In these times, all factions knew better than to waste resources.

They found a secluded warehouse, set up tents, and crashed.

Leo would call if anything happened.

They slept straight through till dawn.

When they saw Leo again, he looked relaxed.

Lucy asked, "Heading back to base today?"

The other teams would probably come looking to buy intel soon.

"Was just about to find you." Leo smiled. "Reinforcements are here. Help them with ID registration, then we'll move out."

He lowered his voice. "Got you the best villa in the safe zone. I'll take you there when we get back."

A reward for last night's service.

Lucy understood. "Thanks, Lieutenant."

"Don't mention it." He waved it off. "Need anything, just ask."

As they spoke, the reinforcements arrived.

Lucy helped register two newcomers.

While Leo handled the handover, he suddenly remembered something. "You taking your chopper back?"

"If possible, today." Lucy said. "We won't be returning here."

Leo hesitated. "You have a pilot? We're shorthanded..."

"Don't worry. We've got it covered." She gave him a reassuring look.

"Alright. I'll fly back with you. Stay close."

"No problem!"

At the airfield, Leo let them pick any aircraft.

Finn and the others gaped at the rows of fighter jets.

Though none could fly them, they each took turns sitting in the cockpits before finally settling on the helicopter.
###Chapter 288: New Skill Unlocked

"Lucy, we're totally out of our depth here!" Finn Wallace scratched his head, staring helplessly at the helicopter.

Lucy White crossed her arms and circled the aircraft, a confident smirk playing on her lips.

"This isn't your average chopper," she said, patting the sleek exterior. "Latest AI flight system. Limited edition worldwide."

Asher York's eyes widened. "No wonder the controls look so unfamiliar!"

"The producers really went all out," Xavier Boone chuckled. "Even their product placements are next-level."

With practiced ease, Lucy swung open the cockpit door and slid into the pilot's seat.

"Hop in. Let's take this bird for a spin."

The guys exchanged glances before scrambling aboard with excited grins.

[OMG! Lucy's about to flex another skill!]
[That entry was straight fire!]

As the helicopter lifted off, Lucy's fingers danced across the control panel with precision.

"Watch this—new-gen autopilot system," she explained while maneuvering. "30% more efficient than traditional models."

Finn leaned forward, eyes sparkling. "This is insane!"

"I'm buying one after this!" Asher already had his phone out searching for the model.

Lucy smirked. "Ask the producers for their sponsor discount."

[LOL the most lethal product placement]
[Lucy's endorsement game is unmatched]

The chopper cruised smoothly over mountain ranges when suddenly Lucy's gaze sharpened.

"Brace yourselves!"

She yanked the controls upward, executing a flawless barrel roll that dodged a flock of birds.

"Holy—!" Finn white-knuckled the armrests. "That was intense!"

Lucy adjusted her headset with a grin. "Impressive maneuverability, right?"

Xavier wiped his brow. "Seriously, Lucy—were you a fighter pilot in another life?"

[SCREAMING! That was epic!]
[11/10 flying skills!]

Twenty minutes later, they touched down with textbook precision.

Lucy vaulted out and flashed a peace sign at the cameras.

"Don't forget to wire my endorsement fee."

[Producers: Best investment ever]
[Lucy remains undefeated!]

Meanwhile, global orders for the helicopter model began flooding in.

A producer monitoring the sales data nearly dropped his tablet.

"Contact Lucy's agent—now!"
"We need her as our global ambassador!"
###Chapter 289: Such Calculated Moves

After returning to the base, Lucy White skillfully landed the helicopter on the designated pad.

"You all go rest first. I need to report on the armory situation," Lieutenant Leo said, waving them off.

Lucy knew he was actually going to debrief about last night's incident but simply nodded without comment.

Back at their quarters, the group idly passed time by playing mobile games together.

Knock knock knock—Over an hour later, a rap sounded at the door.

"Got time? Let me show you the villas," Leo stood at the entrance, beaming.

"Absolutely!" They immediately tossed their phones aside and sprang up.

The villa district was quite a distance away, so Leo specially drove an armored SUV to pick them up.

The scenery outside the windows blurred past, and fifteen minutes later, a pristine new neighborhood came into view.

"This was originally a newly built residential area, now designated as the core zone of the base," Leo explained. "Only those with special contributions to Safe Haven get to live here."

Lucy's team clearly fell into that category, hence their allocation of an outer-ring standalone villa.

"There are five vacant units here—pick one," Leo pointed at several white two-story houses nearby.

"Same interior?" Lucy asked.

"Yep, just different locations."

After touring the options, they selected the one closest to the central garden. Standing on the balcony, the entire garden vista unfolded before them.

"Here, the keys," Leo grinned as he handed them over. "I had a feeling you'd choose this one."

This villa had the prime spot, with several families eyeing it—all of whom he'd blocked.

"Thanks," Lucy accepted the keys before adding, "If you ever need help, just ask."

Leo's eyes lit up. "Then I won't hold back."

He hurried off, and soon after, military trucks arrived delivering essential supplies.

"Boss, someone wants to buy intel," Finn Wallace waved his phone. "Should we have them come over?"

Lucy smirked. "Let them come. Perfect chance to show them what we're made of."

Finn caught her meaning and promptly sent their location.

Several teams arrived quickly but were stopped at the villa district's entrance.

"Register first," the guard said coldly.

Only after verification were they permitted entry.

"Holy hell, how are you living here?" Everyone gaped at the luxurious villa.

Finn cocked his chin up proudly. "Base reward. Jealous?"

"How’d you pull that off?" someone couldn’t help asking.

"Classified," Finn replied mysteriously, gesturing them inside.

Soon, the living room was packed.

"You really have two intel leads?" a team leader asked skeptically.

Xavier Boone nodded calmly. "Obviously."

"Proof?" the man pressed.

Lucy had prepared for this. She pressed a button on her watch—

Ding! First intel unlocked...

The robotic female voice echoed through the room, leaving everyone stunned.

"You—you actually recorded it?"

The teams exchanged glances, now completely convinced. Simultaneously, they cursed inwardly: Team White is way too calculated!

"Deal!" Several captains gritted their teeth in agreement.

Just one point—they could afford that!

Little did they know, this was only the beginning...
###Chapter 290: Jackpot

The team captains exchanged glances before reluctantly complying with Xavier Boone's request, sending text messages to the system number from their phones.

Lucy White tapped her screen, compressing and sending the audio file.

A soft ding signaled the delivery.

The captains eagerly hit play. As the recording's contents became clear, realization dawned on their faces.

"So that's how it is..." murmured a blond captain. "No wonder they wanted points in exchange."

Another captain ventured cautiously, "We heard you've already secured the second clue?"

Xavier's lips curved slightly. "Correct."

"Though the second one's trickier." He held up two fingers. "This much—two points."

The captains shared knowing looks.

"We also heard..." The first speaker lowered his voice. "You're selling the lab location and access method separately?"

Xavier and Lucy exchanged amused smiles.

So those two teams had leaked the information after all.

Though the base didn't openly guard the lab, surveillance was everywhere. Apart from Lucy, no one had managed to open that biometric door.

Those teams must've wasted their points failing to access it, then spitefully spread the news.

Perfect.

"True," Xavier confirmed readily. "This one's a bargain—just one point."

The captains visibly relaxed. "We'll take that!"

The second clue's authenticity was questionable—no sense being swindled.

Xavier produced a stack of pre-prepared notes from his backpack, distributing them methodically.

Other teams gaped.

Damn, this was premeditated!

Grumbling internally, they still completed the transactions through gritted teeth.

Better than wandering around clueless.

As the group prepared to leave, urgent knocking interrupted.

Finn Wallace opened the door to reveal base staff outside.

"Lieutenant Leo sent supplies," said the lanky lead man, offering a receipt. "Miss White's signature, please."

Lucy took the pen, signing with a flourish.

Crates of provisions followed—fresh produce, staples, poultry, even brand-new bedding.

The other teams stared, slack-jawed.

They'd nearly torn the island apart scavenging meals, while Team China lounged in luxury?

This wasn't a competition—it was a vacation!

Finn and the others barely suppressed smirks as they conspicuously arranged the bounty.

"Why's the base giving you so much?" someone finally blurted.

Finn jutted his chin proudly. "Because our Boss Lucy completed two S-rank missions!"

"Boss...Lucy?" Blank stares all around.

Finn pointed. "That's her—our Boss."

The other teams: "......"

What kind of title was that?

"Ahem, impressive..." they forced out, burning with curiosity. "What missions were worth this?"

As Finn hesitated, Lucy answered casually:

"Dr. Roland's biometric lock malfunctioned. I fixed it."

She shrugged. "Saved a few researchers too."

Skeptical but confronted with the evidence, they had to believe.

"Oh," Lucy added suddenly, "do you know the lab's location?"

Headshakes.

"Thirty-minute drive." She blinked innocently. "But without navigation..."

Watching their dismay, her smile sweetened:

"Funny—I happen to have spare maps..."

The other teams nearly choked.

This...was next-level entrepreneurship.
###Chapter 291: The Humblebrag Master

"Hurry up, let's go! It'll be dark soon!"

Asher York stood at the villa entrance, twirling the latest military dagger in his hand. Sunlight glinted sharply off the blade.

Competitors from other teams stared in awe.

"Is that... another one of those...?"

"Yep!" Finn Wallace slung an arm around Lucy White's shoulders. "Our Lucy here 'borrowed' it from the armory. Jealous?"

The crowd fell silent.

This was just unfair!

"One map per team, no cheating," Lucy said cheerfully, pulling out a thick stack. "Limited supply, so get yours now."

Several team leaders gritted their teeth as they approached.

"This is ridiculously expensive!"

"Expensive?" Lucy blinked. "Then don't buy it."

She made a show of putting the maps away. "We're in no rush."

"Wait, wait!" they scrambled to stop her.

This woman was ruthless!

After securing their maps, someone timidly asked, "Any discounts?"

"Sure!" Lucy nodded brightly. "Buy two maps, get one free helicopter ride. Deal?"

The crowd: "..."

This was straight-up predatory bundling!

"Let's move!" Several team leaders stormed off in frustration.

"Hold up!" Jasper King suddenly called after them. "The lab door has a complex lock. Need professional lockpicking services? Just one point~"

The lead competitor stumbled mid-step.

[LMAOOOO]
[Lucy's scamming them into oblivion]
[Business genius right here]
[Other teams: We're terrified]

The live chat exploded.

Inside the villa, Finn hugged his rifle, grinning like an idiot. "Lucy, their faces turned green!"

"Just wait," Lucy sipped her tea leisurely. "When they realize that lab door won't budge..."

The group exchanged knowing smirks.

Meanwhile, backstage, Lily Green stomped her foot in fury.

"How did she gain more followers again?!"

Her assistant whispered, "Maybe... because she's good at business?"

"Shut up!"

Lily dug her nails into her palms as she glared at Lucy's triumphant smile on screen.

Why did this bitch have all the luck?
###Chapter 292: Delivered to Our Doorstep

Clatter—

Lucy White neatly organized the collected supplies with swift precision, her movements resembling a game of Tetris.

Growl—

Finn Wallace's stomach suddenly rumbled.

Jasper King raised an eyebrow. "Starving much?"

"You wouldn't get it," Finn grumbled, rubbing his belly. "Haven't had a hot meal in three days."

Just then, an irresistible aroma wafted from the kitchen.

"Holy—!" Asher York bolted upright. "What's Lucy cooking? My mouth is watering."

Xavier Boone adjusted his glasses, the lenses flashing with wisdom. "Anyone who's seen her cooking segments knows she's Michelin-star level."

"No way." Jasper craned his neck skeptically.

Twenty minutes later.

Clack!

Finn's chopsticks dropped onto the table as he stared at the empty plates in disbelief. "Did I just eat four bowls?"

"That braised pork..." Jasper smacked his lips. "Beats my mom's version."

Asher patted his rounded stomach blissfully. "Lucy, whoever marries you is one lucky bastard."

"Damn right!" Finn suddenly slammed the table. "Future partners gotta pass our approval first!"

Xavier dabbed his mouth calmly. "I know a few private investigators—"

"Hey!" Lucy laughed helplessly. "Are you guys forming a dating screening committee now?"

The livestream chat exploded:

[LMAO these clowns]
[Lucy: Thanks but no thanks]
[Why does this bromance hit different?]

Ding-dong—

The doorbell rang abruptly.

Xavier opened it to reveal several disheveled contestants, their eyes glued to the empty plates on the table.

"Uh..." Their leader swallowed hard. "We came to buy intel..."

Jasper crossed his legs. "Payment first."

After the transaction, they kept stealing glances toward the kitchen.

"What're you staring at?" Finn growled like a territorial guard dog. "Keep looking and I'll charge extra!"

Next morning.

Lucy was frying eggs when Lieutenant Leo barged in.

"Smells amazing!" His eyes locked onto the sizzling pan.

With a deft wrist flick, Lucy plated the golden-brown eggs. "Need something?"

Leo reluctantly tore his gaze away. "Dr. Roland's relocating. Specifically requested your lockpicking skills."

Lucy's lips curved slightly.

—The fish took the bait.

She'd anticipated the base would come crawling eventually. Those precious research files meant more than life itself.

"No problem." She untied her apron briskly. "When do we leave?"

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting dappled light across her delicate profile. No one noticed the fleeting shadow in her eyes.

This opportunity to approach Dr. Roland had arrived even sooner than expected.
###Chapter 293: Thickening Suspicion

"Move out! Rendezvous at the landing pad in thirty!" Lieutenant Leo's voice crackled through the comms.

Lucy White grabbed her backpack, swiftly stuffing it with energy bars and spare magazines. Outside the window, the guttural snarls of zombies grew louder.

"Go!" With a sharp gesture, her squad fell in behind her.

At the landing pad, Dr. Roland's lab coat billowed in the rotor wash. Behind him stood three assistants—one of whom made Lucy's pupils constrict.

"Sam?"

The man looked equally stunned. "Lucy? You're—"

"You know each other?" Lieutenant Leo's gaze flicked between them.

Lucy shrugged. "We've met." She jerked her chin toward the armored SUV parked nearby. "He gave us that ride."

Sam smiled warmly. "She saved my life, actually."

Dr. Roland whirled around, his glasses flashing. "So you're the one who rescued my brother." He extended a hand. "Thank you."

Lucy shook the unnaturally cold fingers, her brow creasing almost imperceptibly. These two... looked nothing alike.

"Blended family," Sam explained, as if reading her thoughts. "Not blood, but closer than most."

The roar of engines cut the conversation short. Dr. Roland boarded the first chopper with Sam and two assistants, followed by a dozen heavily armed special forces operatives.

"You take the wheel," Lucy said, sliding into the co-pilot's seat beside Lieutenant Leo while Xavier Boone took the controls.

As the helicopter lifted off, a decayed hand suddenly clawed at the door!

BANG! Finn Wallace blew its head off, sending the zombie plummeting.

"Damn things are getting bolder," he growled, slamming the door shut.

Lucy feigned nonchalance. "Sam's part of the research team?"

"Investor," Leo adjusted his headset. "Ran a biotech firm pre-apocalypse. The 'assistant' title's just for show."

Lucy exchanged a glance with Xavier.

"Speaking of," Leo turned abruptly, "you can reset the lab's biometric locks, right?"

"Affirmative." Lucy nodded. "But..." She hesitated.

"What?"

"If the lab belongs to Dr. Roland, why don't he and Sam have access?"

Leo shrugged. "Some researcher-turned-zombie supposedly changed the codes." His tone darkened. "Command only cares about the research."

Before he finished, Lucy suddenly snatched her sniper rifle—

BOOM!

A mutated vulture with a three-meter wingspan exploded midair.

"Holy—!" Leo went pale. Without Lucy's reflexes, they'd be a fireball.

The radio erupted with shouts—other choppers were under attack.

The rest of the flight was a gauntlet. When they finally touched down on the lab's roof, everyone was drenched in cold sweat.

The scene in Sublevel -1 made Lucy narrow her eyes—

Dozens of foreign special forces were stymied before the lab doors. Their expressions when the Chinese team arrived were priceless.

Most striking was the blond leader in front, his breached explosive device still smoking.

"Scheiße," he stared at Lucy, mangling the Chinese, "how you get in?"

Lucy didn't answer. Her gaze fixed past the crowd to the crimson handprint on the lab door—

Fresh blood.
###Chapter 294: The Perfect Trap

Lieutenant Leo and his team froze at the laboratory entrance, stunned by the scene before them.

Dozens of ragged survivors huddled near the door, their faces etched with exhaustion and terror.

"Who are you?" Leo narrowed his eyes, his hand resting on his holstered pistol.

A dust-covered man stumbled forward. "Sir... we're refugees."

"Three days ago, we lost half our group to a horde..." His voice cracked. "We barely made it here."

From the rear of the formation, Lucy White's lips curved in an imperceptible smirk.

What a performance. He's wasting his talent here.

Leo's scrutinizing gaze swept over the crowd. "This area's dangerous. How'd you find this place?"

"The zombies chased us here," the man explained hastily. "We saw this building and took shelter."

He suddenly dropped to his knees. "Please... take us to the safe haven!"

The crowd erupted into murmurs, several people breaking into quiet sobs.

Leo frowned. "Not now."

He signaled his team to maintain vigilance. "We'll send transport after completing our mission."

Disappointment flashed across the man's face, but he dared not protest.

Lucy noted how Leo's eyes remained sharp despite his reassuring words.

These soldiers aren't easily fooled.

"Wait over there." Leo pointed down the corridor. "Don't wander."

Only after the survivors retreated did Leo turn to Lucy.

"We need your help."

She nodded and approached the control panel.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard with such speed that several "survivors" gaped in shock.

"No way..." someone muttered.

The biometric lock beeped, and the heavy doors slid open.

Lucy swiftly programmed access for the officers, her movements practiced as if she'd done this countless times.

A sharp intake of breath came from the corner.

Finn Wallace suppressed a laugh, cocking an eyebrow at their stunned audience. Several team leaders turned purple with rage.

"Move out." Leo entered first.

The moment the doors sealed, the corridor exploded with whispers.

"What the hell is Lucy White's background?"
"Wasn't she just some pretty face?"
"Pretty face my ass!"

Captain Rex of Team One licked his chapped lips. "Let them enjoy their moment."

His counterpart from Team Two smirked in understanding. "We'll collect our dues with interest later."

The conspirators exchanged glances, reaching silent agreement.

Let Team China strut around for now.

When finals came...

They'd make them pay back every last cent.
###Chapter 295: Is She Cheating?

Boom—

The laboratory door slid open at Lucy White's lightest touch.

Dr. Roland was busy packing equipment with two assistants, while Sam Wilson lounged nearby with crossed legs.

"Aren't you helping?" Lucy arched an eyebrow.

Sam shrugged. "These hands only know keyboards. Manual labor? Hard pass."

"Ah, nepotism perks." Lucy smirked.

"Resource optimization," Sam corrected, leaning closer. "But you—hacking biometric locks? Should I call you Shadow now?"

Lucy narrowed her eyes. "Your own security locks you out?"

Sam avoided her gaze. "Well... the administrator turned zombie. Who saw that coming?"

Three hours later...

Lieutenant Leo scratched his head at the overloaded helicopter. "Miss White, need a favor."

"Evacuation run?" Lucy instantly understood. "Doable. But—"

"Got it!" Leo cut in. "Standard rate—one point per team!"

On the tarmac, international contestants gaped as Team China returned.

"Lockpick service. One point per use." Lucy cheerfully raised one finger.

Captain Rex of Team One twitched. "Since when did China become middlemen?"

"Mutual benefit." Lucy tapped the control panel. Ding. The gate obediently opened.

Everyone: "......"

This counted as "complex operation"?

By the bookshelf, Lucy suddenly announced: "One box per person."

"Impossible!" someone scoffed.

The next second, after Captain Rex took a box, another materialized on the shelf.

"What sorcery?!" a voice shrieked.

Every captain swiveled to stare at Lucy like she'd grown horns.

This woman was definitely cheating!
###Chapter 296: Seriously?

The entire arena fell into stunned silence.

Even the live comments froze for a second.

Everyone remembered clearly—after Team China took the box, the shelf had been completely empty.

For another one to suddenly appear could only mean the AI system was playing tricks.

[Lucy's insane! She predicted this?!]
[The foreign teams must be feeling that slap across their faces.]
[Queen Lucy strikes again! Destroy them!]

None of the teams that made it to the finals were pushovers.

After the initial shock, they quickly regained their composure.

In this virtual world, nothing was ever as it seemed.

Following the instructions on the boxes, each team stepped forward to claim theirs.

Every time one was taken, a new one materialized on the shelf.

Only when the last box was removed did the shelf finally stay empty.

Just as Lucy White had said.

The other competitors' expressions shifted.

This seemingly delicate woman from the East was far more dangerous than she appeared.

"Should we unlock them together, or separately?"

Lucy smiled innocently, gesturing around. "There are plenty of private labs here. You can work on your own."

Though they knew she was stirring the pot, the suggestion was exactly what they wanted.

Captain Rex of Team One spoke first. "Excellent idea, Miss White. We'll work alone."

He added meaningfully, "Once we crack it, we'll charter a flight straight to the base."

The other teams quickly agreed.

The remaining teams scowled.

They'd planned to piggyback off others' efforts—now that plan was ruined.

This Lucy White was a master at disrupting their schemes.

Lucy blinked. "These cipher locks are tricky. They'll take at least an hour."

"We'll scout outside for survivors. Meet you at the base."

Captain Rex suddenly interjected, "Could you leave someone behind? In case we... get stuck?"

His pause was heavy with implication.

The other teams caught on immediately.

If Team China left entirely, they might get locked in the lab.

Lucy glanced at Xavier Boone. "Captain, you stay."

"Since you're good with locks, might as well earn some extra cash."

Xavier smiled warmly. "No problem. Stay safe out there."

With their captain as a hostage, the other teams finally relaxed.

Lucy led her three teammates out of the lab.

Outside, zombies caught their scent and swarmed toward them.

Finn Wallace sucked in a breath. "There's too many! We can't fight them all!"

Lucy suddenly pulled out a brush and cinnabar ink from her bag. "Let me try a paralysis talisman."

She'd grabbed these from a funeral supplies shop earlier.

In seconds, she finished drawing the sigil and handed it to Finn. "Stick it on a zombie's forehead."

Finn gave her a "you're kidding" look.

But at her serious expression, he reluctantly obeyed.

"Holy—it actually worked?!"

The tagged zombie froze instantly, like someone had hit pause.

The other three gaped.

This defied all logic!

Lucy was already mass-producing talismans.

Armed with long poles, Finn and the others started tagging zombies like some bizarre game of whack-a-mole.

The live comments exploded:
[Magic vs. zombies?!]
[Is there anything Lucy can't do?!]
[This is next-level ridiculous LOL]
###Chapter 297: Who Is This Woman Really?

The livestream chat exploded instantly.

[Holy crap! Lucy's move was insane!]
[Zombies: Do we not get any respect?]
[LMAO first time seeing talismans used against zombies]
[Lucy is the GOAT! Perfect score!]

International viewers were utterly baffled, flooding the comments with question marks.

"WTF? Some kind of Eastern magic?"
"Chinese martial arts are unbelievable!"
"I need to learn this!"

Within minutes, global netizens were frantically searching for "Chinese talismans."

Lucy White strolled calmly through the zombie horde with her team as if taking a leisurely garden walk.

"Watch your step," she even reminded her teammates considerately.

Several arriving squads witnessed the surreal scene.

"What the hell?" A blonde squad leader rubbed his eyes. "Am I hallucinating?"

Lucy waved at them. "Need lockpick service? Friends-and-family discount—just one point."

Everyone: "..."

Did this woman think they were ATMs?

"Those yellow papers..." someone couldn't help asking. "Are they for sale?"

Lucy blinked. "Trade secret. Not for sale."

Internal screaming erupted: We don't want your recipe! Just sell us the damn product!

But nobody dared say it aloud.

After all, this woman could immobilize zombies. Who knew what else she was capable of?

"All survivors got evacuated," someone kindly informed. "You came for nothing."

Lucy arched an eyebrow. "Perfect timing to get back to business."

Returning to the lab, Xavier Boone sipped coffee leisurely.

"That fast?"

"Yep. Switching careers to landlady." Lucy shook her phone. "Made another dozen points."

Other teams gritted their teeth while paying for lockpick services, mentally cursing the Chinese squad eight hundred times over.

The ultimate insult? These people were playing mobile games!

"Wanna join our five-man squad?" Finn Wallace even offered enthusiastically.

Everyone: "..."

Now that's next-level trolling!

After purchasing lockpick services, they still had to buy airfare.

"Total scam!" someone muttered.

Yet their wallets complied obediently.

Boarding the plane, later arrivals dramatically recounted Lucy's "heroics."

"Seriously?"
"Swear on my dog!"
"That woman's unnatural..."

Dozens of probing stares locked onto Lucy.

Jasper King whispered, "You've got targets on your back."

Lucy chuckled. "Proof I'm exceptional."

Everyone: "..."

The audacity!

During the flight, several gearheads stared longingly at the cockpit.

"Can I just touch the yoke? One second!"

"No," the pilot flatly refused.

Internal wailing erupted: Chinese squad, you have no heart!

Meanwhile, leaders of elite teams exchanged meaningful glances.

This woman... needed to be dealt with.
###Chapter 298: Your Points Aren't Worth Our Time

The roar of helicopter blades filled the air.

Inside the cabin, team members from various nations sat stiffly. Suddenly, a mutated vulture with a wingspan over three meters swooped toward them, its razor-sharp beak glinting ominously in the sunlight.

"Look out!" someone shouted.

Before the warning fully registered, Lucy White had already raised her sniper rifle.

Bang!

The bullet pierced clean through the vulture's skull, sending its massive body plummeting to the ground.

Silence enveloped the cabin.

Every gaze shifted to Lucy, their expressions shifting with newfound respect. This petite Eastern girl had just taken down the threat with terrifying precision.

"The Eagle Nation team's marksmanship lives up to its reputation," Captain Rex of the first team said with a strained smile.

Lucy holstered her rifle, casually wiping the barrel. "Flattery won't get you anywhere."

"About those zombie virus leads..." Rex lowered his voice. "You've got intel, don't you?"

Lucy arched a brow. "Trying to fish for secrets?"

"We'll trade points," Rex gritted out.

Other teams immediately chimed in. "Yeah, we'll pay!"

A lazy smirk curled Lucy's lips as she leaned back in her seat. "With your pitiful points?" She waggled a finger. "Not worth our time."

Rex's face darkened.

Finn Wallace bit back a laugh, shoulders shaking. Watching these usually arrogant hotshots get put in their place was downright satisfying.

"Don't be mad," Lucy said, blinking innocently. "Friendship first, competition second. But..." Her tone sharpened. "Trade secrets are off the table."

The cabin filled with the sound of teeth grinding.

"Wanna game?" Lucy suddenly pulled out her phone, waving it at Finn and their teammates.

"Lucy, you legend!" Finn immediately scooted closer. "You got multiplayer working up here?"

"Easy." Her fingers flew across the screen. "Just tweaked the code."

Nick Carter from the neighboring team gaped. "How the hell—?"

"Want me to show you?" Lucy didn't even glance up. "Pay up first."

Nick immediately shoved his phone at her. "Do mine! Dinner's on me later!"

Soon, game sound effects erupted through the cabin as two teams battled it out, leaving others to watch enviously.

"Lucy," Nick said between rapid button presses, "ever consider joining my company? Name your salary."

"Pass." Lucy executed a flawless pentakill. "I like my current gig."

"Being a celebrity's gotta be boring..." Nick pressed.

Lucy's lips curved. "Watching certain people seethe while I game? Now that's entertaining."

She deliberately glanced toward Rex's team, where the fuming captain pretended to sleep.

Nick burst out laughing. "Point taken!"

Sunlight streamed through the windows as the helicopter pressed onward, illuminating Lucy's focused profile. A faint smirk played on her lips as she dominated the game.

Some were already regretting their life choices—why hadn't they befriended the Eagle Nation team sooner?

###Chapter 299: A Masterstroke Move

Nick Carter's identity was well-known within the industry, so his attempt to recruit Lucy White seemed almost expected.

What truly piqued everyone's curiosity was Lucy herself.

This woman could crack top-tier biometric locks, wield firearms with uncanny precision, and now she was even altering game code.

And let's not forget those rumored talisman-drawing skills.

Just how many hidden talents did she possess? Team China had truly struck gold.

Live comments exploded:

[Lucy's unlocked another skill!]
[Game company tech consultant—that title's badass!]

Executives from major domestic gaming firms watched the livestream, already scheming recruitment strategies.

David Wilson shook his head while viewing the broadcast. His phone had been ringing off the hook with offers to poach Lucy.

Having an exceptional employee was proving troublesome for the boss.

Even Ethan Smith tuned in during mission breaks. Watching Lucy shine, his lips curled into an involuntary smile. Though he'd known about her abilities, witnessing her brilliance never failed to stir his heart. At least the livestream eased the ache of separation.

Meanwhile, a chopper touched down at the base landing pad where Lieutenant Leo had been waiting with his team. Thanks to Lucy's prior arrangements, a private vehicle whisked them away upon arrival.

The other dozens of arrivals weren't so fortunate—herded onto base buses for temporary residency processing.

With Safe Haven overcrowded, newcomers were relegated to the lowest security tier—cramped eight-person quarters with Spartan conditions. The expressions of these pampered elites turned ashen. Accustomed to mansions and luxury cars, the thought of sharing space with strangers made their skin crawl.

The salt in the wound? Team China got a private villa.

[Thank god for Lucy]
[Their faces are priceless]
[The disparity's brutal]

Comments overflowed with amusement while international viewers roasted their own teams' performances—especially top-ranked squads facing the harshest criticism. Without marked improvement, they'd return home to public flaying.

After two leisurely days at the villa—cooking, crafting talismans, and gaming—representatives from other teams came knocking. This time, nobody haggled for intel; they straightforwardly sought to purchase the second clue.

The previous victims' misfortunes had taught them wisdom—better to spend two points than waste effort fruitlessly.

Team China, tired of games, obliged every request at the fixed rate. Upon payment confirmation, Lucy simply played a pre-recorded video revealing the complete clue.

The revelation stunned everyone—she'd prepared this in advance? Such foresight was staggering. While other teams toiled, Team China earned points from their couch. A masterstroke indeed.

Over the following fortnight, teams struggled with the first clue's challenges as mutated birds grew increasingly aggressive, eventually transforming into avian zombie swarms. Lucy's talismans proved invaluable—where sniper rifles fell short against hordes, she'd unleash precision sigils to immobilize targets.

While others labored, Team China conducted effortless rescue missions via chopper, simultaneously completing base tasks and contributing to infrastructure—earning triple point categories daily.

Less fortunate teams returned battered and bruised each evening, injuries becoming routine. After three weeks, only Team China remained unscathed; others suffered casualties or total wipeouts.

As time lapsed, desperation mounted. Both bases had been scoured without tracing the virus's origin. Dr. Roland's lab remained under intense surveillance yet yielded no leads. The cruel irony? His team was diligently developing the cure.
###Chapter 300: We Don't Need It

The countdown in the villa showed only seven days remaining.

Finn Wallace paced anxiously across the living room, his forehead breaking out in angry red blemishes. The rest of the team fidgeted, their eyes darting toward the windows.

"Lucy, aren’t you worried at all?" Finn asked for the umpteenth time.

Lucy White steeped her tea with deliberate calm, the fragrant steam curling in the air. "Why rush? What’s meant to come will come."

Xavier Boone accepted a cup, his fingers tracing the rim. "The clues are right in front of us. You just haven’t seen them yet."

Asher York raked a hand through his hair, sending a few strands floating to the floor. "But time isn’t on our side!"

A sharp beep cut through the tension—the walkie-talkie crackled to life.

Lieutenant Leo’s voice came through, urgent. "Captain White, emergency mission."

Lucy’s lips curved as she gave the team a knowing glance. "See? Right on schedule."

"Safe Haven needs an escort for Dr. Roland to collect a rare plant in the outskirts—rumored to be tied to the cure. Departure at dawn tomorrow. We’d like your team to join."

"No problem," Lucy answered smoothly.

The moment the transmission ended, silence swallowed the room.

Finn gaped. "You knew this was coming?"

"Lucky guess." She took a sip. "Every game needs an ending."

Xavier set his cup down with a crisp clink. "This mission is our final chance."

Night fell. The villa’s doorbell rang.

Xavier answered, unsurprised to find several squad leaders outside. "Here to team up?"

"Exactly," the lead captain nodded. "Strength in numbers."

Lucy rose from the couch, her skirt swaying gracefully. "Sorry, but we don’t need it."

The visitors froze. "Why? We can share intel—"

"Because," Lucy smiled, bright and razor-sharp, "real hunters don’t partner with their prey."
