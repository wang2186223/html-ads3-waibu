###Prologue

The autumn leaves crunched beneath Evelyn Sinclair's designer boots as she strode down Fifth Avenue, her caramel-colored trench coat fluttering in the crisp Manhattan breeze. The city pulsed around her - yellow cabs honking, businessmen barking into phones, and the ever-present hum of ambition that made New York's elite thrive.

"Miss Sinclair!" A breathless voice called from behind. Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, jogged to catch up, clutching an iPad like a lifeline. "Nathan Blackwood's office just confirmed your 3 PM at Blackwood Tower. And..." she hesitated, "...Victoria Hayes will be attending."

Evelyn's step faltered for just a heartbeat before she smoothed her expression. "Of course she will," she murmured, adjusting her Prada sunglasses. Victoria Hayes - Nathan's razor-sharp secretary who'd made it her personal mission to undermine Evelyn since their disastrous first meeting at the Met Gala.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Serena Whitmore. "Darling," her agent's voice crackled through the line, "the Vanity Fair cover is confirmed, but they want exclusives about you and Nathan. The whole city's talking since the Hamptons incident."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. That damned yacht party where Nathan had pulled her into a moonlit kiss just as the paparazzi's flashes erupted. "Tell them they'll get what they pay for," she said coolly, spotting the imposing silhouette of Blackwood Tower ahead.

Inside the marble lobby, the elevator doors slid open to reveal Nathan Blackwood himself - all six-foot-two of tailored Armani power, his storm-gray eyes locking onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity. "You're late," he said, though the corner of his mouth twitched.

"Fashionably," she countered, stepping into his personal space with the confidence of a woman who knew exactly what effect her Givenchy perfume had on him.

Victoria materialized beside them, her clipboard a weapon. "Mr. Blackwood, the Tokyo call starts in four minutes."

Nathan didn't glance away from Evelyn. "Reschedule it." The command hung in the air as the elevator ascended, carrying them toward a meeting that would send shockwaves through Manhattan's elite circles - and unravel secrets buried deeper than the foundations of Blackwood Tower.

Somewhere in the city, a new Gossip Girl post pinged across thousands of screens: Spotted: E and N playing with fire again. But darling, everyone knows fire either forges or destroys... which will it be? 
###Chapter 1

The golden rays of the afternoon sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting a warm glow over the sleek modern furniture. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her half-empty wine glass. The city sprawled beneath her, alive with movement and possibility, yet she felt an inexplicable restlessness gnawing at her.

Her phone buzzed on the marble countertop, breaking the silence. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, flashed on the screen: "Meeting with Preston Whitmore moved to 3 PM. He insists on discussing the script changes in person."

Evelyn sighed. Preston Whitmore, the acclaimed director, was notorious for his last-minute demands. She typed a quick reply before setting the phone down. The script—her latest project—had been her obsession for months. A psychological thriller that could either cement her reputation as a rising star or send her career spiraling into obscurity.

The doorbell chimed, pulling her from her thoughts. She wasn’t expecting anyone.

Frowning, she padded across the plush carpet to the intercom. "Yes?"

"Delivery for Ms. Sinclair," a muffled voice replied.

Evelyn pressed the buzzer, allowing access. Moments later, a courier handed her an elegant black box tied with a silver ribbon. No note, no return address.

Her pulse quickened as she lifted the lid. Inside lay a single red rose, its petals velvety and perfect, alongside a small, folded card. She unfolded it with careful fingers.

"The game begins. Are you ready, Evelyn?"

The handwriting was unfamiliar, the message cryptic. A prank? A fan? Or something more sinister?

Before she could dwell on it, her phone rang again—this time, an unknown number. She hesitated, then answered.

"Hello?"

A deep, smooth voice sent a shiver down her spine. "Did you like my gift?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone. "Who is this?"

A low chuckle. "Let’s just say I’ve been watching you. And I think we’re going to have a lot of fun together."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at the phone, her breath shallow. This wasn’t just a coincidence. Someone was playing with her—and she had no idea why.

The intercom buzzed again.

"Ms. Sinclair? Your car is here for the meeting with Mr. Whitmore."

She exhaled sharply, forcing herself to focus. Whatever this was, she wouldn’t let it derail her. Not today.

But as she stepped into the elevator, the rose still in her hand, one thought echoed in her mind:

Who the hell was watching her?

"Sign it." The deep, velvety voice cut through the silence like a blade. "After the divorce, I won’t pursue legal action. I’ll even add another two hundred million to the settlement and transfer your studio under your name. And the penthouse in the financial district—"

Evelyn Sinclair pressed a hand to her lips, stifling the laughter threatening to spill out.

Her almond-shaped eyes sparkled as she skimmed the divorce agreement, mentally counting the zeros. So many beautiful, beautiful zeros.

Across the desk, Nathan Blackwood watched her with narrowed eyes. His chiseled features were set in a cold mask, his dark gaze unreadable. He noted the way Evelyn’s shoulders trembled, the way she ducked her head as if overwhelmed.

His jaw tightened.

If only he had known what she was truly capable of, he would never have let things go this far.

To him, Evelyn was a paradox—pitiable yet infuriating. Her parents had been close friends with the Blackwoods, but tragedy struck before she turned eighteen. Out of obligation, his family took her in. And how had she repaid them? By scheming her way into his bed—and then his life.

Since then, his world had been chaos. Relentless pursuit. Unwanted attention. And now, betrayal.

Just weeks ago, she had stolen confidential company files and handed them to a competitor, costing them a crucial deal. The board demanded action.

Hence, the divorce.

"I’m being more than generous," Nathan said icily. "Don’t push your luck."

Had it not been for the memory of her parents, he wouldn’t have offered her a single cent.

He had expected resistance—tears, threats, maybe even another staged suicide attempt. But instead, Evelyn reached for the pen with trembling fingers.

Nathan exhaled. Finally. It’s over.

—

"Oh my god, YES! Freedom at last!"

Nathan froze.

That voice—Evelyn’s voice—had just echoed in his mind, bright with unrestrained glee.

His gaze snapped to her face, but all he saw was her carefully composed expression as she signed the papers.

"Two hundred million! Do you know how many luxury condos that buys? How many pretty boys I can spoil? Nathan, you absolute legend!"

Nathan’s eye twitched.

She hadn’t spoken. Yet he had heard her.

What the hell was happening?

His secretary, Victoria Hayes, stood nearby, watching Evelyn with poorly concealed disdain. "Ms. Sinclair, I hope you’ll reflect on your actions after this. Perhaps—"

Evelyn barely glanced up before scribbling her signature.

"Ugh, spare me the lecture. I didn’t even do it. But hey, if taking the blame means walking away with this payout, I’ll play the villain."

Nathan’s grip on the desk tightened.

She didn’t do it?

All evidence had pointed to her. The security logs. The witnesses. Even he had assumed it was her—because, frankly, she had a history of reckless stunts to get his attention.

But if not her… then who?

Victoria’s face paled as Nathan abruptly stood.

"Retrieve the security footage from the eleventh," he commanded, his voice like steel. "Mrs. Blackwood seems to believe she wasn’t the only one in my office that night."

Victoria’s breath hitched. "Mr. Blackwood—!"

Evelyn blinked. "Wait, what? I never said that! Just sign the damn papers!"

Nathan ignored her, his gaze locked onto Victoria’s paling face.

Something was very, very wrong.

And he was going to find out what.

###Chapter 2 

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her espresso, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp city air. Today was supposed to be just another routine day—meetings, script reviews, perhaps a quick lunch with her agent, Serena Whitmore. But fate had other plans.

Her phone buzzed insistently. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant: "Mr. Blackwood's team just called. He wants to discuss the project in person. Today. At his estate."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Nathan Blackwood? The reclusive billionaire producer who hadn’t stepped into the public eye in years? The same man whose name alone sent Hollywood into a frenzy?

She typed back, fingers flying: "Why? We haven’t even pitched yet."

Lillian’s reply was swift: "No idea. But his assistant said it’s urgent. Car’s arriving in an hour."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. This wasn’t just unusual—it was unprecedented. Nathan Blackwood didn’t summon people. He didn’t need to.

The Blackwood Estate loomed ahead, a sprawling modern fortress hidden behind towering iron gates. As the car rolled up the manicured drive, Evelyn caught glimpses of sleek glass walls reflecting the afternoon light, a stark contrast to the gilded excess of most industry elites.

A stern-faced butler greeted her at the entrance. "Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Blackwood is expecting you in the study."

The interior was just as striking—minimalist yet opulent, every piece of furniture looking like it belonged in a design magazine. But Evelyn barely had time to admire it before she was ushered into a sunlit room where Nathan Blackwood stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back to her.

He turned slowly, and Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Dark hair, tousled as if he’d been running his hands through it. Piercing green eyes that seemed to see too much. And that scar—a faint, jagged line along his jaw that only added to his dangerous allure.

"Ms. Sinclair," he said, his voice low and rough, like gravel under velvet. "I’ve read your script."

Evelyn’s stomach flipped. He’d read it? The one she’d poured her soul into, the project no studio had dared touch?

"And?" she managed, proud of how steady her voice sounded.

Nathan’s lips curved, just slightly. "I want to produce it."

The world tilted.

"But," he continued, stepping closer, "there’s a condition."

Of course there was. With men like him, there always was.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "Which is?"

His gaze locked onto hers, unreadable. "You rewrite the third act. With me."

Silence.

Rewrite with him? The Nathan Blackwood, who hadn’t written a script in a decade?

Before she could respond, the door burst open.

Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, stormed in, her designer heels clicking like gunshots. "Nathan, we have a problem. She’s here."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Not now."

But it was too late.

A woman swept into the room—tall, regal, with ice-blonde hair and a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

Margaret Blackwood. His mother.

And from the way her gaze zeroed in on Evelyn, it was clear: she knew.

The employees of Blackwood Enterprises had long grown weary of Evelyn Sinclair's dramatic antics, especially those working directly under the CEO.

To them, the demand to review the security footage was nothing short of an accusation.

They had all witnessed Evelyn entering Nathan's office with their own eyes—why else would they have pointed fingers at her?

Yet, at Nathan's command, the surveillance footage flickered to life on the screen.

The video fast-forwarded, clearly showing Evelyn entering and lingering for nearly half an hour before leaving with a stormy expression—likely because she hadn’t gotten what she wanted.

The onlookers exchanged knowing glances, convinced Evelyn was digging her own grave. They couldn’t wait to see her stubborn act crumble.

Only Victoria Hayes was sweating bullets.

Then, her figure appeared on the screen.

Victoria’s pupils constricted as she stole a nervous glance at Nathan.

Some of the employees who had been rolling their eyes at Evelyn now stiffened, while others remained oblivious.

The footage paused.

Nathan’s expression darkened. Unbelievable.

His icy gaze swept over those who had sworn only Evelyn had accessed his office. "Only Mrs. Blackwood entered, you said?"

The senior assistant, unfazed, spoke up. "Mr. Blackwood, I don’t see the issue. Mrs. Blackwood was the only one who—"

Others nodded in agreement.

"They’re selectively blind," Evelyn’s voice echoed in Nathan’s mind, making him scowl.

Then, a new voice cut through. "Actually, two people entered. Mrs. Blackwood and Ms. Hayes."

"Finally, someone with functioning eyes!" Evelyn’s sarcastic remark played in Nathan’s thoughts.

All heads turned toward the speaker—a newly promoted junior assistant who hadn’t been present during Evelyn’s earlier interrogation.

Nathan’s sharp memory recalled the man’s absence during the accusations.

The room erupted in dismissive laughter.

"Ms. Hayes is in and out of the office all the time—she’s Mr. Blackwood’s most trusted aide!"

"You’re new, so you wouldn’t know. Questioning Ms. Hayes is absurd!"

Nathan’s cold scoff silenced them instantly.

Evelyn’s amused voice whispered in his mind, "Oh, if only they knew the truth. Their faces would be priceless."

Her gaze flicked to Victoria—a woman whose effortless elegance made her seem untouchable.

Victoria’s high ponytail was sleek, her curls artfully tousled. Her fitted dress accentuated her figure, and her flawless makeup only enhanced her natural beauty.

But right now, her composure was cracking.

"Can’t blame them, really. They take their cues from Nathan—treating her like a saint and me like a nuisance," Evelyn mused.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Yes, that’s my fault.

"Care to explain, Ms. Hayes?" he demanded.

Victoria’s voice trembled with feigned hurt. "Mr. Blackwood, are you seriously suspecting me?" She quickly steadied herself. "I was only preparing for tomorrow’s meetings—you know I work late every night."

"Convenient timing, wasn’t it? She planned this perfectly. And wow, forced overtime? Nathan, you’re practically a villain. After the divorce, I’m mailing you labor rights pamphlets," Evelyn quipped.

Nathan nearly rolled his eyes. Focus, Evelyn! Your reputation is on the line!

"Everyone who entered my office during that period will be investigated," he declared. "No exceptions."

Victoria’s face twisted in betrayal. She had never imagined Nathan would treat her the same as Evelyn—especially when Evelyn had already confessed!

Hadn’t she been his most loyal confidante for ten years?

The other assistants shifted uncomfortably, clearly thinking Nathan was being unreasonable.

Then—

"OH MY GOD!" Evelyn’s mental shriek nearly made Nathan jump.

What now? he thought irritably, half-listening as Joseph defended Victoria.

"No WONDER Joseph’s gunning for me! He’s Victoria’s SIMP! This is gold!"

Nathan blinked. Joseph? A simp?

"Morning greetings, umbrella reminders, winter scarves—TWO YEARS of unrequited devotion! And when he finally tracked down some rare gift she casually mentioned, he got sick delivering it, and all she said was ‘drink hot water’? Brutal!"

Nathan sighed. If only he put that effort into his reports…

"Oh, it gets worse! He serenaded her outside her apartment at 2 AM, got arrested for disturbing the peace, and apologized for potentially ruining her sleep! The dedication is terrifying!"

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. No wonder his productivity dips.

"Wait—THERE’S MORE?!"

Nathan stiffened. More?

"He’s… uh… let’s just say he’s very devoted to her photo collection. Ew. TMI. Moving on!"

Nathan felt queasy.

Meanwhile, Joseph, blissfully unaware, continued his passionate defense—completely missing the way Nathan and Evelyn were now staring at him with a mix of pity and secondhand embarrassment.

"Hahaha! This is all Hector’s fault!" Evelyn’s voice chimed again.

Nathan frowned. What does Hector have to do with—wait, what was I doing again?

His thoughts derailed, helpless against the tidal wave of Evelyn’s chaotic commentary.

Even the most disciplined minds weren’t immune to gossip.

###Chapter 3

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone pressed tightly to her ear. "Victoria, I need those contracts reviewed by noon," she demanded, her voice sharp with impatience.

On the other end, Victoria Hayes sighed, flipping through the thick stack of papers on her desk. "I'm working on it, Evelyn. But the legal team—"

"No excuses," Evelyn cut in, her manicured nails tapping against the phone. "If Blackwood Entertainment backs out because of delays, I’m holding you responsible."

She ended the call without waiting for a response, tossing her phone onto the velvet couch. The merger with Nathan Blackwood’s company was supposed to be her crowning achievement, the deal that would solidify her empire. But something about the way Nathan’s piercing green eyes studied her during their last meeting unsettled her. He wasn’t like the other men she’d outmaneuvered—he was calculating, unpredictable.

A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped in with a tablet in hand. "Your 10 AM with Preston Whitmore was moved up. He’s waiting downstairs."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a smirk. The famed director was notorious for his temper, but she’d wrapped him around her finger years ago. "Tell him I’ll be down in five."

As Lillian hurried out, Evelyn caught her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirror. She adjusted the plunging neckline of her emerald dress, ensuring every curve was showcased to perfection. Nathan might be a challenge, but she’d never met a man who could resist her for long.

Downstairs, Preston’s eyes darkened with appreciation as she approached. "Evelyn, you’re a vision as always."

She laughed, the sound like polished silver. "Flattery won’t get you a bigger cut of the profits, darling."

His grin turned wolfish. "Worth a try."

Their banter was interrupted when Donovan Sharpe, the producer, rushed over, his face pale. "You need to see this." He thrust his phone toward her.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Splashed across the screen was a headline: "Blackwood’s Secret Past: The Scandal That Could Sink the Merger."

Her grip tightened on the device. Nathan had skeletons—ones she hadn’t uncovered. And if this got out before the deal closed…

"Cancel my afternoon," she ordered, already striding toward the exit. "I need to see Nathan. Now."

Behind her, Preston and Donovan exchanged glances. When Evelyn Sinclair moved this fast, someone was about to get burned.

"At first, Richard couldn't shake his hunger for power, which drove him to send Marcus to investigate Ms. Hayes, hoping to sway her to his side. Little did he know, he’d end up losing his son in the process. If he finds out his son has turned into a lovesick fool, I bet he’ll— Ha! The irony! He’s backing his son now, thinking he’s just securing her support. Not only has he lost his son, but he’s also unwittingly aiding his enemy!" Once again, Evelyn’s inner monologue echoed in Nathan’s mind.

Richard, standing composedly behind his son, suddenly stiffened when he noticed Nathan’s piercing gaze locked onto him.

A smug grin spread across Richard’s face as he puffed out his chest. It seems Nathan’s finally met his match. After my son’s scathing remarks, there’s no way he can walk away with dignity this time! Maybe now, we’ll finally win Victoria over. Let’s see who dares call my son a spoiled brat after this!

"Hey, Nathan! Are you seriously going to humiliate Ms. Hayes for this woman?" Marcus snapped when Nathan remained silent, his expression shifting unpredictably. "Don’t forget—Evelyn is the only one who’s met Mr. Holloway from the rival company! We have photo and video evidence!"

Caught off guard by his own distraction, Nathan cleared his throat and schooled his features into sternness before turning to Evelyn. "Why did you meet him?"

The last time he’d asked, Evelyn had spiraled into hysterics, dodging the question entirely.

This time, even if she refused to cooperate, Nathan was determined to uncover the truth—one way or another.

Evelyn blinked, sensing the situation spiraling out of control. She hadn’t expected Nathan to be so relentless.

From her perspective, Nathan’s integrity was admirable. He was unwavering in his pursuit of fairness.

But that wasn’t what Evelyn wanted. She wanted a divorce!

Just as she opened her mouth to speak, her eyes met Nathan’s. His chiseled features could rival any A-list celebrity’s, and when his full attention focused on her, it was momentarily mesmerizing. She faltered.

Still no sign of the two hundred million… His face was nothing but a beautiful deception. Yet, for a fleeting second, it had ensnared her.

At that moment, his striking face was all solemnity, his entire demeanor radiating an intensity that left no room for nonsense.

His penetrating gaze seemed to strip her bare, sending a jolt through her. Stunned, she blurted out, "It was a job my agent arranged."

The second the words left her lips, she wanted to slam her head against the wall. Was I just hypnotized by a pretty face? Why did I tell the truth?! This is only going to complicate things!

Before anyone could react, Marcus scoffed. "Pathetic excuse. Did your agent suddenly lose her mind, booking you with the competition?"

Blackwood Group owned an entertainment subsidiary with a studio exclusively for Evelyn. Clearly, an agent hired by them wouldn’t take jobs from rivals—unless it was intentional.

Marcus didn’t give Evelyn a chance to explain further. He immediately dialed her agent, Serena Whitmore.

Serena answered instantly, her voice dripping with feigned shock. "What? I never arranged that! Mrs. Blackwood, you can’t pin this on me! I’m just a small-time agent—I can’t handle this kind of blame!"

Of course, a lowly agent wouldn’t dare accuse the CEO’s wife falsely—exactly the impression Victoria wanted to create.

A smug smirk curled Victoria’s lips when no one noticed how forced Serena’s denial sounded.

"Next time, come up with a lie that’s harder to debunk," Marcus sneered at Evelyn before mouthing silently, "You idiot."

Now, Evelyn was genuinely annoyed.

She’d assumed it was a simple setup, with someone like Serena caught in the crossfire. But no—this scheme was far bigger. Even Serena had been bought.

Nathan had considered that too. He was about to order an investigation into Serena when Evelyn’s thoughts invaded his mind again. "I wonder how much they paid her to frame me."

For a moment, Nathan was speechless. Can she just… see whatever she wants?

"What? My innocence is only worth two grand?! No way. There must be an extra zero missing!"

Nathan was baffled. Two thousand? Seriously?

Evelyn’s mental whimper followed. "Ugh, it really is just two thousand— Wait… Oh. So that’s how it is."

What? What is it?! Nathan’s patience frayed.

After an agonizing silence, all he heard was Evelyn’s exasperated sigh.

Nathan, usually unshakably composed, was now teetering on the edge of frustration. Just tell me! How else am I supposed to clear your name?!

Victoria took a steadying breath, her eyes brimming with false sorrow as she faced Nathan. Yet her voice was steel. "If you don’t believe me, I’ll submit to any investigation, Mr. Blackwood!"

Standard procedure dictated tracking Victoria’s recent movements and scrutinizing all her devices.

From Marcus’s earlier claims, Nathan was certain Victoria had never met anyone from the rival company.

But if she dared say that, she must have covered her tracks well.

Did she leave no digital trail? Nathan’s brow furrowed.

"Ah, so that’s her game!" Evelyn’s voice echoed in his mind again.

Nathan perked up. Finally, some answers.

"Her plan is flawless."

Stop being cryptic and just tell me!

"The email was sent on the morning of the twelfth, but even if they recover all deleted files from her computer, they’ll find nothing."

Nathan’s pulse spiked. How is that possible?

"Because she used Marcus’s computer. He trusts her blindly—never suspects her in his office. Even his password is her birthday. So even if she’s suspected, her devices are clean. If the rival company betrays her, the trail leads straight to Marcus."

Nathan’s expression darkened as his glare shifted from Victoria to Marcus.

"But she slipped up. Probably too confident in her position."

Nathan leaned in, eager for the revelation.

But Evelyn’s thoughts trailed off. "Never mind. I can’t reveal what I know anyway. In the end, Ms. Hayes will walk away unscathed. At worst, Serena might take a minor hit. I just want this mess over with."

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. A mess indeed. "Call the tech team. Have them examine Ms. Hayes’s devices."

###Chapter 4 

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her coffee, scrolling through her phone. A message from her agent, Serena Whitmore, popped up:

"Don't forget—meeting with Nathan Blackwood at 10 AM. His team insists on discussing the script changes in person."

Evelyn groaned. Nathan Blackwood—Hollywood's most infuriatingly talented actor—was also the most stubborn man she'd ever worked with. Their last collaboration had ended in a heated debate over a single line of dialogue.

She arrived at the sleek high-rise office fifteen minutes early, determined to maintain the upper hand. But fate had other plans.

The elevator doors slid open—and there he stood.

Nathan Blackwood, in all his unfairly handsome glory, leaned casually against the mirrored wall, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His piercing blue eyes flicked up, locking onto hers with an intensity that made her pulse stutter.

"Miss Sinclair," he drawled, lips quirking. "Fancy meeting you here."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Mr. Blackwood. I see punctuality isn’t your strong suit."

His chuckle was low, infuriatingly smooth. "I was just thinking the same about you."

The elevator lurched—then plunged into darkness.

A sharp gasp escaped Evelyn as she stumbled forward, only to be caught by strong hands. Nathan's grip was firm, his warmth seeping through the thin fabric of her blouse.

"Relax," his voice murmured near her ear, sending an unwelcome shiver down her spine. "Emergency power should kick in soon."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken tension. Then—

"Still hate me, darling?" His tone was teasing, but there was something darker beneath it.

Evelyn scoffed. "Hate implies I care enough to feel anything at all."

A beat. Then Nathan shifted closer, his breath ghosting over her cheek. "Liar."

The lights flickered back on, revealing how dangerously close they stood. Evelyn jerked away, smoothing her skirt with trembling hands.

The doors opened to a hallway full of startled executives.

Nathan stepped out first, throwing her a smirk over his shoulder. "Try to keep up, sweetheart."

Evelyn clenched her fists. This man would be the death of her.

And the worst part?

She couldn’t wait to see him again.

Evelyn hadn’t expected Nathan to humiliate her so publicly. Her face paled, lips pressed into a thin line as she shot him a wounded look—as if he were the villain in this twisted drama.

Marcus, ever the knight in shining armor for his beloved, was seething. "You’re really going this far? This is a direct insult to Ms. Hayes’ honor!"

Nathan’s icy glare could have frozen the room, but Marcus refused to back down. "If you can’t prove anything, you owe her an apology."

The tension was thick enough to cut with a knife. Though no one else spoke, their disapproving expressions said it all.

The entire corporation had gathered, drawn like moths to a flame. After all, a prodigy like Victoria was invaluable to the company.

Most assumed Nathan had lost his mind. Everyone knew Evelyn was nothing more than a nuisance—a wife in name only. But Victoria? She was indispensable.

Evelyn, however, suspected they were all just here for the spectacle.

Their eager, gossip-hungry stares gave them away.

One woman was Nathan’s neglected wife, the other his brilliant protégée. The office had probably started a betting pool on who would win this battle.

Evelyn, who had always been content to stay in the shadows, never imagined she’d become the center of attention.

Turns out I’m the punchline in this joke.

She glared daggers at Nathan’s back, but he remained infuriatingly indifferent.

Has she always been this insufferable? he wondered, irritation simmering beneath his calm exterior.

Then, the investigation results came in.

No surprises—Victoria was cleared of all suspicion.

Marcus smirked triumphantly. "Well, Nathan? Still planning to cover for Evelyn?"

Evelyn could feel Nathan’s gaze shift toward her.

"Mr. Blackwood, do you believe me now?" Victoria’s voice trembled, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Nathan glanced at his phone, then back at her.

The moment their eyes met, Victoria’s blood ran cold.

The room fell silent as Nathan turned toward the screen behind him.

A new surveillance feed replaced the old one.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as the footage played—Victoria entering Marcus’s office.

Confusion spread like wildfire.

What kind of twist is this?

Victoria’s face drained of color. Her hands shook, her breath coming in shallow bursts.

Marcus snapped, "What’s the meaning of this? That’s just Victoria delivering documents!"

Nathan ignored him, his expression unreadable.

Then, a screen recording appeared—someone manipulating a computer.

The wallpaper? A picture of Victoria.

The truth hit like a freight train.

We’re doomed.

Under Nathan’s ruthless rule, they’d all be fired. Victoria had dragged them down with her.

No one dared speak.

Victoria was trembling now, her voice barely a whisper. "Nathan, I didn’t—"

"Serena Whitmore is your cousin’s wife, isn’t she?" Nathan’s voice was lethally calm. "You conspired with her to frame Evelyn."

The room erupted in shock.

Victoria’s knees nearly buckled. "How did you—? You knew all along?"

Even the spectators were stunned. No one had seen this coming.

Evelyn, meanwhile, was still processing the footage.

She had suspected the truth, but Nathan’s sharp instincts surprised her.

He knew Serena’s identity? But how did Marcus get involved?

Nathan caught Evelyn’s bewildered stare.

I can’t exactly tell them I heard it from Evelyn’s thoughts, can I?

Instead, he said coolly, "Once you’re a suspect, every piece of footage with your face gets reviewed. Every device you’ve touched gets scrutinized."

Victoria had made one fatal mistake—she hadn’t deleted the incriminating evidence.

And Evelyn had been the one to point it out.

###Chapter 5

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she sipped her espresso, scrolling through her phone. A message from Preston Whitmore, her director, popped up:

"Evelyn, we need to discuss the script changes. Meet me at Café Noir at noon."

She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. Another last-minute revision.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan Blackwood adjusted his cufflinks in the mirror, his sharp blue eyes assessing his reflection. His assistant, Lillian Graves, handed him a file.

"Mr. Blackwood, the merger documents are ready for your review. Also, your sister, Sophia, called—she wants you at her charity gala tonight."

Nathan barely glanced at the papers. "Reschedule the meeting with Donovan Sharpe. And tell Sophia I'll consider it."

Lillian hesitated. "But sir, the Sharpe deal is—"

"Reschedule it." His tone left no room for argument.

At Café Noir, Evelyn arrived early, choosing a secluded corner booth. She pulled out her script, scribbling notes in the margins. The café buzzed with chatter, the aroma of freshly ground coffee thick in the air.

Then the door swung open.

Nathan strode in, his presence commanding immediate attention. He scanned the room—and froze when his gaze landed on Evelyn.

Their eyes locked.

A beat of silence.

Evelyn’s pen slipped from her fingers. Him. The man from the charity event last month—the one who’d left without a word after their heated exchange.

Nathan recovered first, his lips quirking into a smirk. "Fancy seeing you here, Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Shouldn’t you be off intimidating boardrooms, Mr. Blackwood?"

Before he could retort, Preston rushed in, flustered. "Evelyn! Sorry I’m late—oh." He blinked at Nathan. "You two know each other?"

Nathan’s smirk deepened. "You could say that."

Evelyn ignored the flutter in her stomach. "Preston, let’s focus on the script."

But fate had other plans.

As Preston launched into his revisions, Nathan’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen—Sophia again. With a muttered curse, he excused himself.

Evelyn exhaled, forcing her attention back to Preston. Yet her traitorous mind replayed Nathan’s piercing stare.

Outside, Nathan answered his sister’s call. "What is it, Sophia?"

"Julian’s back," she said without preamble. "And he’s bringing her to the gala."

Nathan’s grip tightened on his phone. Julian and his reckless choices. "I’ll be there."

As he ended the call, his gaze drifted back to the café window—where Evelyn was laughing at something Preston said.

Something primal stirred in his chest.

He hadn’t forgotten their last encounter. And something told him this wouldn’t be their last.

The investigation had been relentless. She was treated as the prime suspect, with every resource dedicated to proving her guilt.

Evelyn had always assumed that even if her unauthorized entry into the office was discovered, Nathan’s routine security check wouldn’t be this thorough. She hadn’t bothered altering the surveillance footage, dismissing it as an unnecessary precaution.

She never expected Nathan to be so ruthless when it came to matters involving her.

Defeated, Evelyn slumped to the ground, her legs giving way beneath her.

Marcus was even more devastated than she was.

"You actually did this? You... Why?" Marcus’s eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed Evelyn’s wrist, his voice trembling with disbelief.

Embarrassed by his son’s outburst, Edward quickly pulled Marcus aside. "Isn’t it obvious? She’s jealous and wants to take Mrs. Blackwood’s place."

Marcus recoiled as if struck. "You’re in love with Nathan? No, that can’t be!"

Edward suppressed a groan. How can my son be this blind? Everyone else can see the truth.

Serena shared the sentiment.

Yeah, he’s completely oblivious. He’s head over heels for Ms. Hayes, yet he has no clue she’s in love with Nathan.

After that silent remark, Serena glanced up—only to catch a flicker of surprise crossing Nathan’s otherwise composed expression.

Wait… Don’t tell me Nathan never realized Ms. Hayes had feelings for him. How dense can a man be?

Nathan, already unsettled by Serena’s inner monologue, felt his ears burn as his carefully maintained mask slipped.

What the hell? I thought this was just a case of corporate espionage—an enemy bribing Ms. Hayes to steal secrets and framing Evelyn in the process. But Ms. Hayes is in love with me? Since when?

"No! That’s not it at all!" Victoria cried out in panic, her desperate gaze locked on Nathan. "Yes, I did what you’re accusing me of, but not for the reasons you think! I did it for Cassandra!"

The room fell deathly silent.

Cassandra—Nathan’s first love.

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Explain."

Victoria rushed to clarify, "Cassandra is coming back."

Nathan’s eyes widened. He instinctively glanced at Evelyn, who looked equally stunned.

Ah, Cassandra. I know her. The woman who broke Nathan’s heart years ago. High society’s golden couple, until she walked away without a second glance.

Nathan was startled that Evelyn knew that much.

Evelyn, meanwhile, was still processing—what did Cassandra have to do with Victoria’s actions?

Nathan turned back to Victoria, his voice icy. "That doesn’t explain what you did."

Victoria, sensing a sliver of hope, blurted out, "Cassandra and I are best friends. She never wanted to leave you—she was forced to. I couldn’t stand the thought of you two losing your chance at happiness because of a misunderstanding. I knew you wouldn’t divorce without cause, so I… I played the villain to create an opportunity for you and Cassandra."

She lowered her head, feigning remorse.

It was true—Victoria and Cassandra had been inseparable. Their friendship had even brought Victoria closer to Nathan, which was why he had trusted her enough to make her his secretary.

But now, Nathan felt nothing but disgust.

He had once blamed Evelyn for being difficult. Now, guilt twisted in his chest, and his anger toward Victoria burned hotter.

Uninterested in her excuses, he said coldly, "Call the police."

Victoria’s head snapped up, her face draining of color. "Nathan, I did this for—"

"Save it for the authorities," Nathan cut her off.

His mercilessness sent a chill through the room. Even now, he chose the harshest punishment.

"Nathan Blackwood!" Victoria shrieked, lunging for him, but he sidestepped her easily. She whirled toward Evelyn, her voice venomous. "You always get a second chance—why am I the exception? I’ve worked for you for ten years! Doesn’t that count for anything?"

Nathan finally looked at her. "Because you’re not my wife."

That single sentence struck like a blade, piercing straight through Victoria’s heart.

She stood frozen, speechless.

Soon, the police arrived, escorting the culprits away. Evelyn, too, was taken in for questioning.

Marcus, ever the fool, tried to take the blame for Victoria, still blindly devoted to her. Edward nearly fainted from rage.

But the evidence was undeniable. No amount of loyalty could change the facts.

As she was dragged off, Victoria screamed at Evelyn, "Once Cassandra returns, Nathan will divorce you! Don’t celebrate too soon!"

A classic villain’s parting shot—yet Evelyn couldn’t help but feel a spark of anticipation.

Really? In that case, I hope she hurries up.

###Chapter 6

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse as she paced the length of her marble-floored living room. Her phone buzzed incessantly—messages from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, and Preston Whitmore, the director who had just offered her the role of a lifetime.

Lead actress in Donovan Sharpe’s new blockbuster.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she scrolled through the contract details. This was it—the break she had been waiting for. But then, her gaze flickered to the framed photo on her bookshelf—a candid shot of her and Nathan Blackwood at last year’s charity gala. His arm had been slung casually around her shoulders, his smile effortless, his presence magnetic.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Evelyn?" Lillian’s voice carried through the intercom. "Victoria Hayes is here to see you."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Victoria Hayes—Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, the woman who had made it her mission to undermine Evelyn at every turn.

"Let her in," Evelyn said, smoothing her silk blouse.

Victoria strode in, her designer heels clicking against the floor. "You’re considering the role," she stated, not bothering with pleasantries.

Evelyn arched a brow. "And if I am?"

Victoria’s lips curled into a smirk. "Nathan won’t approve."

The words hit like a slap. Evelyn forced a laugh. "Since when does Nathan Blackwood dictate my career choices?"

Victoria leaned in, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Since you became his weakness. He won’t let you take a role that’ll keep you on set for six months in Europe."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "That’s none of your business."

"Isn’t it?" Victoria’s eyes gleamed with triumph. "He’s already pulled strings to keep you close. Did you really think that magazine cover last month was just luck?"

Evelyn’s breath caught. She had wondered why Vogue had suddenly reached out.

Before she could respond, her phone lit up with an incoming call—Nathan’s name flashing across the screen.

Victoria smirked. "Speak of the devil."

Evelyn snatched up the phone, her voice icy. "We need to talk."

Nathan’s deep chuckle sent an unwelcome shiver down her spine. "I was just about to say the same thing, darling."

Three days had passed since Evelyn Sinclair's unexpected transmigration—courtesy of the Grim Reaper's clerical error. With no family to claim her body in her previous life, resurrection was impossible. As compensation for this cosmic blunder, the Reaper granted her a new existence in this world.

Evelyn now inhabited the body of a once-pampered heiress, whose tragic past had left her emotionally shattered. After losing her parents in a devastating accident, she was taken in by the Blackwoods, who treated her with kindness. But grief twisted her into a withdrawn, paranoid shadow of her former self—until she laid eyes on Nathan Blackwood.

Desperate to secure her place in the family, she orchestrated a night with him, getting him drunk enough to succumb. When they were discovered, Nathan's disgust was palpable, but guilt forced him into a reluctant marriage. The shame consumed her, and her heart gave out under the strain—just as Evelyn's soul took over.

Now, Evelyn had no intention of playing the scorned wife. Sure, Nathan is gorgeous and loaded, but what’s the point if he won’t even look at me? I refuse to live like a nun. I missed out on romance in my past life—this time, I’m making up for lost opportunities. If he wants to divorce me? Fine. I’ll take him for every penny.

But the Grim Reaper had one cruel stipulation: She couldn’t file for divorce herself. The original owner would never have initiated it, so neither could Evelyn. Furious, she demanded compensation—and received the Whisper Network, a system that exposed people’s deepest secrets.

Life in the Blackwood estate wasn’t so bad, Evelyn mused. Freedom, wealth, and an absent husband? Perfect. And if she ever strayed, she could always blame Nathan for neglecting her.

Then, opportunity struck.

A scandal that could finally force Nathan’s hand.

But now…

As they left the police station that evening, Nathan guided Evelyn toward the car, the silence between them thick with tension. She slumped against the window, sulking.

I should’ve made a scene! Then I wouldn’t have lost out on two hundred million—an unimaginable fortune!

Nathan’s jaw tightened as her mental lament echoed in his mind. Is she really that desperate for money?

Moments later, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the notification—$3,000,000 deposited.

Her breath caught. Wide-eyed, she turned to Nathan. Did he send this to the wrong account?

He met her gaze, his dark lashes casting shadows over his sharp features. "I owe you an apology," he said, voice low. "This is my way of making amends."

Evelyn forced a stoic expression, though internally, she was screaming.

Holy hell! Three million?! Is there even a limit to his transfers?! Stay calm… It’s nothing compared to what I could’ve gotten, but still—this is insane! Accuse me again, Nathan. Please. I’ll take the cash every time!

Nathan’s lips twitched. The contrast between her composed facade and her chaotic thoughts was staggering. Who knew she was like this?

He studied her—the way her lips pressed together to stifle a grin, her bright eyes shimmering with mischief. The neon glow from the city streets danced across her skin, making her look almost ethereal.

Nathan had never paid much attention to her before—she’d always been sullen, withdrawn. But now? She was radiant.

What changed?

Evelyn’s thoughts spiraled. If I play my cards right, he’ll feel guilty when he divorces me for his precious first love. More guilt means more alimony. This is an investment.

Nathan’s expression darkened.

I’ll buy myself a mansion. Maybe even a sugar baby—adorable or rugged, doesn’t matter, as long as he has abs for days.

Nathan nearly choked. I have abs.

I can’t wait for this divorce.

His hands clenched into fists.

Was she truly this eager to leave? Or was she just hurt, masking her pain with fantasies?

If she wanted out, why hadn’t she asked?

It’s definitely not about the money.

As they pulled into the Blackwood estate, another car sat in the driveway—guests.

Before Nathan could process who it was, Evelyn bolted toward the house, her eyes alight with excitement.

More drama! High society is a goldmine of scandals. Maybe I should stick around a little longer…

Nathan stared after her, incredulous. That’s not why she’s staying.

He quickened his pace. Wait for me.

Inside, a voice rang out:

"Mom, Dad, this is Liam—the child Sophia and Daniel are adopting."

Evelyn’s grin widened.

Oh, this is going to be good.
###Chapter 7

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse as she stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, cradling a steaming cup of Earl Grey. The city below was just waking up, but her mind was already racing with the events of last night.

Nathan Blackwood’s unexpected confession still echoed in her ears.

"I can’t pretend anymore, Evelyn. Not when every damn second without you feels like torture."

A shiver ran down her spine. She had spent years building walls around her heart, and yet, in one reckless moment, he had shattered them all.

Her phone buzzed—Victoria Hayes, her ever-efficient secretary, had sent a barrage of messages.

Victoria: The press is already speculating about you and Nathan. We need damage control. Now.

Evelyn sighed. Of course they were. Last night’s gala had been a spectacle—Nathan, the elusive billionaire, pulling her onto the dance floor in front of half of New York’s elite. The cameras had caught every heated glance, every whispered word.

She typed back.

Evelyn: Let them talk. I’m done hiding.

Before she could second-guess herself, another notification popped up—this time from Serena Whitmore, her agent.

Serena: You’re trending. The studio is thrilled. But we need to discuss your next move. Call me.

Evelyn set her phone aside. The world was watching, waiting to see what she’d do next. And for the first time in years, she wasn’t afraid.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Evelyn?" Nathan’s voice, rough with exhaustion, seeped through the wood.

Her pulse spiked. She hadn’t expected him to show up here—not after last night. Not after she’d left without a word.

Swallowing hard, she crossed the room and opened the door.

Nathan stood there, his usually immaculate suit wrinkled, his dark hair tousled as if he’d been running his hands through it all night. His stormy gray eyes locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You couldn’t call?"

His jaw tightened. "Not about this."

She stepped aside, letting him in. The air between them crackled with tension, thick and suffocating.

Nathan didn’t waste time. "I meant what I said last night."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Which part? The part where you said you couldn’t live without me? Or the part where you accused me of running away?"

His gaze darkened. "Both."

She laughed, though there was no humor in it. "You don’t get to waltz back into my life after three years and demand answers, Nathan."

"I’m not demanding anything," he said, stepping closer. "I’m asking."

The proximity was dangerous. She could smell his cologne—something woodsy and intoxicating—and it made her head spin.

"And if I say no?" she challenged.

Nathan’s lips curved into a smirk, the kind that used to make her weak in the knees. "Then I’ll just have to convince you."

Before she could react, he closed the distance between them, his hand cupping her cheek. His touch was electric, sending sparks skittering across her skin.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. This was a terrible idea.

And yet—

She leaned in.

The world outside didn’t matter. The press, the rumors, the past—none of it.

Because right now, there was only Nathan.

And she was tired of fighting it.

The moment Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood stepped into the room, the tense atmosphere shattered like glass. Every head turned toward them.

The butler moved swiftly to take their coats.

"You're back," Margaret murmured, rising from the couch with a nervous flutter of her hands. She reached for Evelyn's fingers, studying their expressions with cautious hope.

Across the room, Richard maintained his dignified posture, though his gaze betrayed his anxiety.

Margaret had questioned Nathan earlier when Evelyn was taken away that morning, but he’d shut her down with a clipped, "Stay out of it." Richard had simply sighed and told his son to handle the mess—after all, Evelyn had made a grave mistake. If Nathan didn’t resolve it, who would?

They’d braced for the worst—divorce papers.

They hadn’t planned on hosting Sophia Blackwood and her family today, but Sophia had sounded frantic over the phone, insisting she needed to discuss something urgent. So here they were.

And Sophia and her husband, Daniel Prescott, had dropped a bombshell of their own.

Evelyn, following the script of her borrowed memories, offered a detached nod—cool, aloof, utterly indifferent to social graces.

Nathan, ignoring the unspoken questions, greeted Sophia’s family first.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the four strangers on the couch.

A stern-faced older woman cradled a frail boy of about eight or nine. He clutched a half-solved Rubik’s cube, his fingers trembling. Beside her sat a lean man in gold-rimmed glasses, smiling but distant. Next to him, a woman with warm features wore a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

Richard and Margaret hesitated to press Nathan and Evelyn for answers. Better to deal with Sophia’s drama first.

Before they could speak, a raspy voice cut through the silence.

"I thought they were divorced? Why are they together?"

The temperature in the room plummeted.

"Mother!" Sophia protested, but her voice lacked conviction. She shot an apologetic glance at Evelyn while Daniel stayed silent, letting his mother snipe unchecked.

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but his tone remained even. "We’re not divorced. Of course we came home together."

Margaret and Richard exchanged startled, hopeful looks. Finally, some good news!

Beatrice Lawson—Daniel’s mother—huffed. "But the rumors are everywhere in high society. They say she—"

Nathan’s patience frayed, but Evelyn beat him to it.

"Since when are the Lawsons part of high society? You’re suddenly privy to insider gossip?"

The Lawsons were middle-class at best. Daniel’s medical career and the Quirks’ backing had given them a foothold, but high society? Please.

Truth stung. Beatrice’s face purpled. "How dare you insult my family?"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Sensitive much? I stated facts. No insults here."

How’s humiliation taste, old hag? Not so fun when it’s you, huh?

Nathan bit back a smirk. If Beatrice wanted to start this fight, he wouldn’t stop Evelyn from finishing it.

He guided Evelyn to the sofa, ignoring Beatrice’s sputters.

As they sat, Nathan caught his parents’ stunned expressions.

They gaped at Evelyn, bewildered. Had they just—?

Her lips hadn’t moved.

Nathan’s pulse spiked. He glanced at Sophia, who was staring at Evelyn with equal shock.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Beatrice’s battle raged on.

"Ungrateful brat!" Beatrice hissed.

The Blackwoods’ faces darkened. Evelyn was family. This woman had no right.

Margaret opened her mouth, but Evelyn was faster. "True. No one taught me how to stoop to your level." Her gaze raked over Beatrice with undisguised disdain.

Call me uneducated while you shove your niece at Nathan behind my back? Delusional hag.

Margaret touched Evelyn’s arm gently. "You’re back late, darling. Have you eaten?"

Darling. The endearment sent a shiver down Evelyn’s spine. Orphaned young, she’d never been called anything so tender.

Margaret’s so kind.

Margaret lit up. Evelyn rarely showed affection—always distant. She’s just shy!

Evelyn shook her head.

Margaret beamed. "What would you like?"

"Anything."

"Maria, prepare Evelyn’s favorites," Margaret called, then squeezed her hand. "I’m sorry Nathan didn’t bring you home sooner. You must be starving."

Nathan’s eyebrow twitched. "Mom, I haven’t eaten either."

Margaret waved a hand. "Oh, fine. Make a plate for Nathan too."

Nathan exhaled. Evelyn bit back a laugh but met his gaze and quickly schooled her expression.

A fruit platter slid toward her.

"Snack first," Richard said casually.

Richard’s thoughtful too. They’re such a perfect couple.

Richard sat taller, pleased.

Sophia smiled faintly at Evelyn’s inner monologue and her parents’ reactions—until two icy glares killed her mood.

Her mother-in-law and husband blamed her for the Blackwoods’ "neglect." But Sophia knew better.

Nathan noticed her distress and frowned. His attention shifted to the boy with the Rubik’s cube—quiet, possibly autistic, but clearly bright given the nearly solved puzzle.

Reminds me of Julian and me as kids.

Recalling Evelyn’s earlier thought, he asked, "Who’s the boy?"

###Chapter 8

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows, painting the sleek modern furniture in warm hues. She stood by the floor-to-ceiling glass, sipping her espresso, her mind still replaying last night's encounter with Nathan Blackwood.

That man is infuriatingly charming.

Her phone buzzed—Victoria Hayes, her ever-efficient yet subtly scheming secretary.

"Ms. Sinclair, your 10 AM meeting with Preston Whitmore has been moved up. He insists on discussing the script changes immediately."

Evelyn sighed. Preston, the acclaimed director, was known for his last-minute demands. She typed a quick reply.

"Tell him I'll be there in twenty."

As she grabbed her blazer, her assistant, Lillian Graves, rushed in, holding a tabloid.

"You might want to see this."

The headline screamed:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Actress Seraphina Delacroix's Hotel at Dawn!"

Evelyn's grip tightened on the paper. Seraphina—the rising star with a reputation for seducing powerful men.

Of course.

She tossed the tabloid aside. "I don’t care about his personal life."

Lillian raised a brow. "You sure? Because your jaw just clenched hard enough to crack a walnut."

Evelyn shot her a glare. "Focus on the meeting."

The studio was abuzz when she arrived. Preston, a man with salt-and-pepper hair and sharp eyes, waved her over.

"Evelyn! We need to talk about the third act. The chemistry between the leads isn’t translating on screen."

She crossed her arms. "What do you suggest?"

Preston smirked. "More intimate scenes. Raw tension. The audience wants to feel it."

Before she could respond, a deep voice cut in.

"Then maybe you should cast actors who don’t need a script to fake chemistry."

Nathan.

Dressed in a tailored navy suit, he leaned against the doorframe, his smirk mirroring Preston’s.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Unbelievable.

Preston chuckled. "Speaking of which—Nathan, perfect timing. Let’s run the balcony scene. Evelyn, you’re up."

Nathan’s gaze locked onto hers, challenging. "Unless you’re too busy?"

Her nails dug into her palms. "Bring it on, Blackwood."

As they took their positions, the air between them crackled—half hostility, half something far more dangerous.

Nathan stepped closer, his voice dropping to a whisper only she could hear.

"Still pretending you don’t care about my hotel visits?"

Her breath hitched. "Still pretending you’re not trying to provoke me?"

His grin was pure sin. "Who’s pretending?"

Preston’s voice boomed. "Action!"

And just like that, the lines between script and reality blurred.

Holy Moly

At last, they reached the heart of the matter. Daniel masked his irritation, his voice steady but cold. "His name is Liam. Sophia and I are planning to adopt him. From this moment forward, he will be our son. Liam, this is your Uncle Nathan and Aunt Evelyn. Say hello."

Just as Liam rose hesitantly to greet them, Richard cut in sharply, his expression dark. "Hold on. We haven't discussed this yet."

Liam's face paled, and he sank back into his seat, shoulders hunched.

Margaret, her heart aching for the boy, suggested gently, "Perhaps Liam should go play outside."

Adult matters shouldn’t be aired in front of a child.

"It’s fine," Daniel dismissed, indifferent to the boy’s distress.

Richard, barely containing his fury, finally snapped. "Let me be blunt. Sophia is only thirty—she’s still young enough to have children. You bring this boy home and announce an adoption without even consulting us? Is this how the Prescotts operate?"

Beatrice interjected smoothly, "You can’t blame us. After Sophia’s complications during her first delivery, the doctors said conceiving again would be difficult. We can’t afford to wait indefinitely..."

Nine years ago, Sophia had suffered a stillbirth and had struggled to conceive since. The Blackwoods, however, believed modern medicine could still offer hope. They hadn’t expected the Prescotts to show up with an adopted child in tow.

Sophia’s eyes welled with tears.

Are they that desperate? Is Daniel on his deathbed, the Prescott lineage hanging by a thread?

Evelyn, idly spearing a piece of fruit, scoffed internally.

The Blackwoods, barely restraining their outrage, nearly laughed at the absurdity. Even Sophia, emotional as she was, fell silent.

Nathan cleared his throat, squeezing Evelyn’s arm. "Dinner’s almost ready. Save room."

Then, turning to Daniel, he asked pointedly, "What’s the rush? Even if you’ve given up hope, why choose a child his age?"

Evelyn set her fork down, impressed. Damn, Nathan nailed it.

Nathan blinked. Wait—there’s actually something fishy here?

Richard and Margaret exchanged startled glances. What?

Sophia shuddered, staring at Evelyn in shock.

Before Daniel could respond, Nathan pressed, "What’s so special about this boy? Why him?"

Beatrice and Daniel stiffened. The older woman forced a dry chuckle. "He’s nine, and he bears a resemblance to Daniel and Sophia. It felt like fate, so..."

Richard and Margaret scrutinized Liam. He does look like them.

Sophia only grew more upset, tears spilling over.

For some reason, Liam ducked his head further, guilt radiating off him.

Evelyn’s mind raced. Holy moly! Liam is Daniel’s biological son! Sophia didn’t give birth to him—which means he’s Daniel’s love child! And now he’s forcing Sophia to raise him? The audacity! The sheer shamelessness!

The Blackwoods gaped, stunned, their eyes darting between Beatrice, Daniel, and Liam.

Sophia, bewildered, stared at Evelyn. How does she know?

They’d pressured Sophia to hide the truth, framing it as an adoption and warning her against revealing Liam’s origins. They’d claimed the Blackwoods would cause a rift if they found out. As if that weren’t enough, they’d gaslit Sophia into believing her infertility was her own fault—that they had to secure the Prescott bloodline. Seriously, who do they think they are? Royalty? Evelyn fumed. And Sophia actually bought this? Good grief. What did she do to deserve this?

The Blackwoods were speechless, their eyes nearly bulging out of their sockets.

Sophia, heartbroken, choked back a sob.

Nathan’s face turned to stone as the truth sank in.

Is she really that hungry?

But watching her devour her food while absorbing the drama made his own stomach growl. He picked up his fork.

Better deal with this on a full stomach.

The tension was so thick no one noticed Nathan and Evelyn eating like this was just another dinner.

Beatrice’s smile soured, while Daniel, though seething, didn’t dare confront the Blackwoods. Instead, he turned on Sophia. "Sophia, you agreed to this, didn’t you?"

"Surely you won’t turn away my only grandson?" Beatrice added, laying on the guilt.

"Enough," Richard snapped, fury boiling over. "Sophia, whatever you decide, we support you. No one gets to bully you!"

Daniel and Beatrice faltered.

"Dad, I..." Sophia panicked, glancing at Liam.

Though Liam had been well-behaved, and Daniel’s indifference to the boy gave her some relief, she couldn’t shake her discomfort. Any other child, maybe—but not this one.

Not when his name, Liam, echoed Adriana, Daniel’s ex.

"Sophia!" Daniel’s voice held a warning edge.

Sophia flinched, looking to her parents. "I don’t know what to do! Mom, Dad, what do you think?"

Margaret and Richard exchanged disappointed glances. Sophia had always been kind, but never weak. How had marriage reduced her to this?

Nathan set his fork down with a sigh, ready to intervene. This boy isn’t becoming family.

Before he could speak, Evelyn’s mental roar nearly deafened him. Dmn it! Why is she hesitating? They’re humiliating her! Why hasn’t she filed for divorce yet? What’s she waiting for?!*

###Chapter 9

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone pressed tightly to her ear. Serena Whitmore's voice crackled through the line, urgent and unyielding.

"Evelyn, you need to get to the studio now. Nathan Blackwood just greenlit your script revisions—but there's a catch."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee cup. "What catch?"

"Victoria Hayes is already there." Serena's tone dripped with disdain. "She's convinced Preston Whitmore to reconsider your lead role."

A cold ripple shot down Evelyn's spine. Victoria had been undermining her at every turn, but this? This was outright sabotage.

Across town, Nathan Blackwood leaned against his office window, watching the city pulse below. His assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered by the door, clutching a tablet.

"Sir, the board is waiting for your decision on the Sinclair project."

Nathan exhaled sharply. Evelyn's script was brilliant—raw, emotional, everything his studio needed. But Victoria's interference complicated things.

"Tell them I'll address it personally."

Lillian hesitated. "And Ms. Hayes?"

A shadow crossed Nathan's face. "Keep her away from Evelyn."

The studio lot buzzed with tension when Evelyn arrived. Crew members scattered as she strode toward Soundstage 4, her heels clicking like a countdown. Inside, Victoria stood beside Preston Whitmore, her smirk razor-sharp.

"Ah, Evelyn. So glad you could join us." Victoria's voice oozed faux sweetness. "We were just discussing how dated your dialogue feels."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "Funny. Nathan seemed to think it was groundbreaking."

Preston cleared his throat. "Let's not make this personal. Victoria raised valid concerns about marketability."

Before Evelyn could retort, the door swung open. Nathan stepped in, his presence slicing through the room like a blade.

"Enough." His gaze locked onto Victoria. "The script stays as is. Evelyn's vision is non-negotiable."

Victoria's smile faltered. "Nathan, be reasonable—"

"Leave." The single word was glacial.

As Victoria stormed out, Preston sighed. "You're making enemies, Nathan."

Nathan didn't flinch. "And you're forgetting who signs your checks."

Evelyn's breath hitched. This wasn't just professional backup—it felt like a declaration.

Later, in the studio's private lounge, Nathan handed Evelyn a whiskey. "You handled yourself well."

She took the glass, their fingers brushing. "Why did you intervene?"

His jaw tensed. "Because I don't tolerate sabotage. And because..." He trailed off, his eyes darkening.

Evelyn leaned in. "Because what?"

A beat of silence. Then—

"Because I can't stand seeing you doubt yourself."

The air between them crackled, charged with something neither dared name.

Outside, thunder rumbled—a storm brewing, just like the chaos ahead.

The Blackwood family trio froze simultaneously, as if struck by lightning. Sophia's face drained of all color.

Her greatest fear had been the possibility of not being able to adopt. But divorce? That was a curveball she never saw coming. Her first instinct was vehement denial.

The Blackwoods knew Sophia would never initiate a divorce. Despite her gentle exterior, she had a stubborn streak a mile wide. If it were up to them, they'd have pushed for separation ages ago, given Daniel's perpetual indifference toward her.

Yet when Evelyn's words hung in the air, the Blackwoods couldn't help the spark of hope that flickered to life.

Oh, how they longed to convince these two to call it quits!

Nathan, Margaret, and Richard exchanged loaded glances.

Taking the lead, Nathan voiced what they all thought: "The child's existence proves your marriage was a mistake from the start. You should divorce."

Daniel and Beatrice looked utterly gobsmacked. Their jaws practically hit the floor. In high society, illegitimate children were practically a status symbol!

When Nathan glanced at Margaret and Richard, he found them nodding in agreement.

But then Sophia, ever the disappointment, murmured, "This... this doesn't mean Daniel wronged me."

The Blackwoods' expressions fell like three disappointed emojis.

Evelyn nearly choked on her appetizer.

Sophia hung her head, the picture of dejection, mirroring little Liam beside her.

Daniel scoffed. "Exactly. If we're keeping score, I'm not the one who should be apologizing."

Though spoken softly, everyone heard. The room went so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Sophia turned ashen, suddenly losing all interest in the adoption discussion. Someone had found her Achilles' heel.

Evelyn's gossip radar pinged loudly.

Why was the Blackwood heiress living like a doormat? And how did Daniel have the audacity to act self-righteous with a love child? Time for some mental digging.

Nathan saw the wheels turning in Evelyn's head and tried to intervene—too late.

Turns out Sophia and Daniel were university seniors. After Daniel's breakup with Adriana, he drowned his sorrows at a campus party. Sophia played caretaker... and things got messy. Wait, why does this sound familiar?

Nathan looked ready to facepalm. Have you no shame?

Evelyn's mental excavation continued.

The next morning, Adriana arrived to reconcile—only to find them in bed. Heartbroken, she vanished without a trace. When sober Daniel realized what happened, he exploded. He accused lovestruck Sophia of taking advantage, destroying his chance with Adriana forever. Then Sophia got pregnant. The Blackwoods strong-armed Daniel into marriage, leaving Sophia drowning in guilt. After losing the baby, she offered divorce—but Daniel refused. Couldn't have people thinking he'd dump a barren wife, could he? That might tarnish his precious reputation. Besides, he sneered, this mess was all Sophia's fault—she didn't get to quit.

The Blackwoods sat in stunned silence.

Watching this, Beatrice and Daniel grew smugger by the second.

"Your choice," Daniel told Sophia, his tone icy.

The illusion of free will only tightened Sophia's shackles. As she opened her mouth, Evelyn's sarcastic inner monologue cut through:

Holy crap, this guy's the king of gold-diggers! I've seen leeches before, but this takes the cake.

If Daniel had refused initially, the Blackwoods would've paid Adriana to disappear. His "noble" agreement to marry fooled everyone—until his cold neglect revealed his true colors. Turns out he'd been resenting Sophia and her family this whole time.

Now, according to Evelyn's deductions, Daniel only married to exploit Blackwood resources!

Sophia looked shell-shocked, staring at Daniel like she'd never seen him before.

This man who projected such proud independence, who acted like he didn't need Blackwood connections—was actually a parasite? The cognitive dissonance made her wonder if Evelyn was being cruel.

Evelyn's mental commentary continued:

If infertility was the real issue, divorce would solve it. All that "principle" talk is BS. Truth is, Daniel's addicted to the Blackwood gravy train. Wants all the perks with zero effort—then has the nerve to complain about the service. The audacity!

Sophia's mind reeled like a broken slot machine.

Friends had voiced suspicions before, but she'd always defended Daniel angrily.

Evelyn's thoughts intruded again: Fine, he's a mooch. But demanding his wife raise his affair baby? What kind of Stockholm syndrome does Sophia have?

The Blackwoods collectively side-eyed Sophia, their frustration palpable.

Wait—he actually told Sophia that without her, he'd be back with Adriana and their child would be legitimate? So she has no right to refuse? Jesus, years of gaslighting have turned this woman into a doormat. Self-reflection is good, but not when you're taking blame that belongs to someone else!

Sophia's eyes welled up.

Then the self-doubt crept in: Is it really all my fault?
###Chapter 10

The evening air was thick with tension as Evelyn Sinclair stood by the grand floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathan Blackwood’s penthouse. The city lights twinkled below, but her mind was far from serene.

Nathan had been unusually quiet since their return from the charity gala. His sharp jawline was tense, his stormy gray eyes distant. Evelyn knew something was off—she could feel it in the way his fingers had lingered on her waist a second too long before pulling away.

"Are you going to tell me what’s bothering you?" she finally asked, turning to face him.

Nathan exhaled sharply, raking a hand through his dark hair. "It’s complicated."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Try me."

A beat of silence stretched between them before he spoke again, his voice low. "Victoria Hayes has been digging into your past."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "What?"

Nathan’s gaze hardened. "She thinks she can use it against you—against us."

A cold dread settled in Evelyn’s chest. Victoria, Nathan’s cunning secretary, had always been a thorn in her side. But this? This was a direct attack.

Before she could respond, Nathan closed the distance between them, his hands gripping her shoulders. "I won’t let her touch you," he vowed, his voice rough with conviction.

Evelyn searched his eyes, seeing something raw and unguarded there—something she hadn’t expected.

And then, in a moment that shattered every carefully constructed wall between them, Nathan whispered, "I can’t lose you."

Her heart stuttered.

But before she could process his words, his phone buzzed violently. Nathan cursed under his breath as he glanced at the screen—Victoria’s name flashing ominously.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

Whatever game Victoria was playing, it had just escalated. And now, Evelyn had a choice—retreat or fight back.

She clenched her fists.

Game on.

The Blackwood family was shockingly naive when it came to protecting their own interests. Weren’t elite families supposed to be ruthless and calculating? Yet here they were, soft-hearted and trusting, easily played by some arrogant man.

The Blackwoods felt personally attacked by Evelyn’s thoughts.

Nathan, especially, was a disappointment. Shouldn’t a business tycoon like him be a master strategist? He’d always seemed so sharp before!

Nathan was at a loss for words. How was he supposed to read someone’s deepest thoughts? Only Evelyn could do that with her system.

He’d never thought much of Daniel—just some guy his sister had fallen for. Their marriage had been lukewarm at best, but Daniel had never outright harmed Sophia… until today. Nathan had always stayed out of his siblings’ personal lives, offering advice only when asked. He never imagined the mess lurking beneath the surface.

Evelyn had indulged in so much gossip that she felt sick. Finally, she set down her fork.

No way. This was too infuriating. Time to stir the pot. Even if she couldn’t reveal what she knew, she could still wreck this doomed marriage.

Nathan watched the little troublemaker plotting, the corner of his mouth twitching. Let her have her fun.

Straightening, Nathan cut straight to the point. "Sophia, our family’s stance hasn’t changed. We want you to divorce. If you refuse, it’ll be a disgrace. And if that happens, we’ll cut all ties with the Prescott family."

The Blackwoods quickly realized Nathan was setting a trap—testing whether Daniel was truly after power.

Though Nathan fully trusted Evelyn’s words, the others were still skeptical. After all, Daniel’s true motives were impossible to verify. This was Nathan’s way of proving it to them.

And it forced Margaret to open her eyes.

"What are you saying?!" Beatrice shrieked, whipping her head toward Richard and Margaret.

Richard didn’t mince words. "Nathan is the head of this family now. His word is final."

Daniel’s expression twisted, humiliation and fury flashing across his face. The Blackwoods had initially doubted Evelyn’s assumptions, but now, they sensed something was very wrong.

Only Beatrice was in full panic mode. She grabbed Sophia’s arm, pleading, "Listen to your brother! He doesn’t even see you as family! You’re driving us into ruin—no heir to carry on the Prescott name! If you could just give us a child, we wouldn’t be in this mess!"

The words were a slap in the face. Margaret’s expression darkened instantly. Without hesitation, she pulled Sophia back to her side.

"Then let your son remarry. No one’s stopping him from having as many children as he wants. He could even bring home the mother of his other child. What’s the problem? Or are you all just desperate to keep my daughter trapped?"

Beatrice yanked Daniel to her side. He scowled at Nathan, about to speak—

Nathan smirked. "If you’re worried about reputation, don’t be. If you divorce, just say the Blackwoods couldn’t tolerate an illegitimate child. It won’t reflect badly on you. After everything our family has done for the Prescotts, you can’t possibly think Sophia still owes you anything."

One sentence. That was all it took to shut down every excuse. Daniel paled.

Damn, that’s cold. The Blackwoods finally made their move! Guess I won’t be needed after all.

Listening to Evelyn’s delighted mental commentary, Nathan’s lips curved slightly.

Of course, the Blackwoods didn’t want an innocent child left homeless. But they also couldn’t stand seeing their beloved Sophia miserable.

One neglectful husband was bad enough. Look what Sophia had become. Add a child to the mix? She’d break.

Divorce was the only option.

A dangerous glint flashed in Daniel’s eyes. His voice dripped with threat. "Sophia, is this how you feel too?"

In the past, Sophia would’ve rushed to soothe him, bending over backward to protect his pride and the Prescott family’s interests.

But this time, she stayed silent. She was still reeling from Evelyn’s revelations.

For a split second, Daniel’s mask slipped.

Beatrice wailed, "No! You can’t divorce! Sophia, who else would want you if you can’t even have children?"

"Tch. The Blackwood heiress has no shortage of suitors," Richard snapped.

Sophia’s face burned. How does Evelyn know about this?

Faced with such humiliation, she’d been too ashamed to speak up. She’d assumed the problem was with her own body—never suspecting anything else.

The Blackwoods were livid. How dare Daniel blame Sophia when he was the one who’d never even tried!

But confronting him about it was beneath them. At this point, there was no need for further questions.

This marriage was over. Daniel had gone too far.

If Sophia still refused to see reason, they’d force the separation.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s thoughts had taken another wild turn.

This doesn’t add up. Even if he didn’t love Sophia and refused to share a room with her… where else would he go? The hospital? Was he really that busy? He’s the director—surely not. Unless…

A chill ran down the Blackwoods’ spines.

Evelyn didn’t let her assumptions cloud her judgment. Following her gut, she considered the possibility: What if he’s been raising a child somewhere else this whole time?

She could theorize, but she needed proof. Accusations couldn’t be thrown around lightly.

Holy sh— Hell no!

Hearing Evelyn’s mental cursing, the Blackwoods braced themselves.

They held their breath, waiting for the bombshell.

Even Sophia froze, her emotions flatlining.

On the eighteenth floor of the luxury apartments next to the hospital… for the past nine years, Daniel and Adriana have been living there as husband and wife.

###Chapter 11

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced nervously by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Her fingers trembled slightly around the steaming mug of Earl Grey, its bergamot scent doing little to calm her racing thoughts.

Nathan Blackwood's text from last night still burned in her mind: "We need to talk. Tomorrow. 10 AM."

No emojis. No warmth. Just five words that had stolen her sleep.

Her assistant Lillian Graves bustled in, balancing a tablet and a fresh croissant. "The car's ready downstairs," she announced, then hesitated. "You look like you've seen a ghost, Evelyn."

Evelyn forced a laugh that sounded hollow even to her own ears. "Just pre-meeting jitters." She checked her Cartier watch—9:47 AM. Thirteen minutes until potential heartbreak.

The elevator ride to the lobby felt like descending into an abyss. Through the tinted windows of her town car, Manhattan blurred into streaks of gray and steel. Every red light stretched into eternity.

At precisely 10:02 AM, Evelyn pushed open the heavy oak door of The Penrose Club's private lounge. Nathan sat silhouetted against the fireplace, his broad shoulders tense beneath a charcoal Tom Ford suit. The flames cast flickering shadows across his chiseled jawline.

"You're late," he said without turning.

Evelyn's Louboutins clicked against the parquet as she approached. "Traffic on Park Avenue." A weak excuse. They both knew she'd been stalling.

Nathan finally turned, his stormy blue eyes locking onto hers. In his hand glinted something that made Evelyn's breath catch—a velvet ring box, open to reveal a pear-cut diamond that could blind a small nation.

"Alexander Quirk would have given you a speech," Nathan said quietly. "But I'm not him." He snapped the box shut. "This isn't a proposal."

Evelyn's knees nearly buckled. "Then what—"

"It's collateral." Nathan's thumb traced the box's edge. "For when I destroy Victoria Hayes."

Outside, a sudden downpour lashed against the windows. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled like a waking beast.

Evelyn realized two things simultaneously: First, Nathan had discovered Victoria's embezzlement scheme. Second—and far more terrifying—he intended to use her as bait.

The diamond's facets caught the firelight as Nathan pressed the box into her palm. His fingers lingered just a heartbeat too long. "Do you trust me, Evelyn?"

A loaded question. The kind that could either save them or burn everything to the ground.

Somewhere in the club's depths, a clock chimed ten-fifteen. The witching hour had arrived.

Sophia's knees buckled, her vision swimming as darkness threatened to consume her. She clutched the edge of the table, barely keeping herself upright.

Margaret, her expression twisted with fury, steadied her daughter.

Across the room, Richard's veins pulsed visibly at his temples. His aura was lethal—like a dethroned king ready to tear apart the usurper who dared touch what was his. With a single glance, his assistant, Alfred, understood and swiftly exited the room.

Nathan, the new king, had already pulled out his phone, issuing commands in a low, dangerous voice.

The Prescott family remained oblivious to the storm about to break over them.

Daniel, seeing the Blackwoods' refusal to back down, turned his glare on Sophia. His voice dripped with condescension. "Are you really going to blow this out of proportion? Since when did you become so unreasonable?"

Sophia lifted her head slowly. Her bloodshot eyes, filled with devastation, sent an unexpected pang through Daniel’s chest.

"Why?"

The word was a whisper, laced with betrayal. She had believed he married her out of obligation—because he couldn’t have his true love and needed someone to raise his child. But now she knew the truth. He had been with his mistress all along.

Why hadn’t he just divorced her? Why string her along, then blame her for everything? How could he stand there, so shamelessly righteous?

Daniel scoffed. "What do you mean, why? Fine. If you can’t accept him, we won’t adopt him. I’ll send him back tomorrow."

That night, Sophia’s defiance had unsettled him. He thought conceding might regain control.

But Sophia saw right through him. The illusion of the perfect man she once admired had shattered, revealing the coward beneath.

Evelyn, meanwhile, was seething. She knew Sophia and the others had heard the truth, but she couldn’t outright expose Daniel—not without revealing her own secret. So, she twisted the knife another way.

"Send him back? Earlier, you claimed his mother was missing. Yet now, you seem very familiar with her whereabouts. Have you been seeing her all this time? Maybe we should investigate—see if you’ve been meeting her behind Sophia’s back. Surely, you don’t expect her to raise your affair baby while you play happy family elsewhere?"

Daniel’s pupils flickered. Panic edged into his voice. "How dare you slander me? My mother was right—you have no decency!"

Nathan’s voice cut through like a blade. "Shut up."

Two words. Quiet, yet devastating. They struck Daniel like a physical blow, leaving him momentarily paralyzed.

If not for the need to keep Evelyn’s ability hidden, they would have torn him apart already.

Evelyn smirked, pointing at Liam. "Look at your son’s face before you deny it."

Children couldn’t lie as well as adults. When Evelyn’s accusation hit its mark, Liam paled.

Before Daniel could react, Margaret pressed, "Sweetheart, tell us the truth. Have you met your father before? Good boys don’t lie."

Liam couldn’t hold back. He tugged Daniel’s sleeve, pleading, "Dad, let’s go home. Mom is—"

Daniel’s breath hitched. In his panic, he jerked his arm away—too harshly. His hand struck Liam’s cheek with a sharp crack.

The boy tumbled off the couch, a red handprint blooming across his face.

Chaos erupted.

Evelyn gasped, pulling Liam toward her, shielding him. Sophia’s heart ached at the sight. Despite everything, she couldn’t bear to see him hurt. She gathered him into her arms, soothing him with gentle strokes.

Liam’s guilt deepened. Sophia was kind—so kind—and his parents had used her. The weight of it crushed him.

Finally, he whispered, "My parents… they’ve always been together. They told me I was a secret. That the only way I could have a normal life was if you adopted me. I didn’t understand… but I knew it was wrong."

Before Daniel could respond, Nathan slammed his phone onto the table. A video call played—Adriana, bound to a chair, screaming as masked men surrounded her.

"Mom!" Liam shrieked.

Daniel’s face drained of color as a voice reported, "Mr. Blackwood, we’ve found their shared apartment. Documents, photos—proof they’ve been living together for years."

Daniel staggered back—just as a whip sliced through the air.

CRACK.

A bloody welt split his cheek. He howled, collapsing as the whip struck again and again.

Richard, usually composed, had snapped. His daughter had been humiliated, deceived—and he would make Daniel pay.

Paula rushed forward, wailing. Liam threw himself in front of his father, sobbing. "Please, stop! Don’t hurt him!"

Richard finally stilled, chest heaving.

Daniel lay broken, his body a map of lash marks.

Then Sophia spoke—her voice raw, broken, but resolute.

"Daniel Prescott… I want a divorce."

###Chapter 12

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathan Blackwood had already left, his side of the bed cold. A faint trace of his cologne lingered in the air, teasing her senses.

She stretched, her muscles protesting slightly from last night’s events—a gala that had ended with whispered arguments and stolen glances. Nathan had been distant, his usual charm replaced by a brooding intensity that set her nerves on edge.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Lillian Graves, her assistant:

"The press caught wind of your argument with Nathan at the gala. The tabloids are spinning it as another breakup. Serena wants damage control ASAP."

Evelyn groaned, rubbing her temples. Of course, the media had twisted things. They always did.

She dragged herself out of bed, wrapping a silk robe around her frame before padding to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The city sprawled beneath her, alive and indifferent.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Evelyn?" Nathan’s voice, low and hesitant.

She turned, her pulse quickening. He stood in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate, but his expression was unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said.

Her stomach twisted. Those words never preceded anything good.

"About last night?" she asked, keeping her tone light.

His jaw tightened. "About us."

A beat of silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken tension.

Then, the elevator dinged in the distance.

Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, stepped into the penthouse, her heels clicking against the marble. "Nathan, the board is waiting. You’re late."

His gaze flickered between Evelyn and Victoria before he exhaled sharply. "This isn’t over."

And just like that, he was gone again.

Evelyn clenched her fists, frustration bubbling beneath her skin. Whatever was eating at Nathan, he wasn’t sharing—and she was tired of guessing.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Preston Whitmore, the director of her upcoming film.

"Emergency reshoots. Studio in an hour. Don’t be late."

She sighed. At least work would be a distraction.

But as she dressed, her mind kept circling back to Nathan. To the way his eyes had darkened when he said, "About us."

Something was coming.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready for it.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. The news had spread like wildfire—Nathan Blackwood, the man who had once shattered her heart, was now entangled in a scandal that threatened to ruin his empire.

Victoria Hayes, her ever-loyal secretary, entered with a tray of coffee, her expression unreadable. "The press is having a field day," she murmured, setting the cup down. "Blackwood Industries' stocks are plummeting."

Evelyn took a slow sip, bitterness lingering on her tongue—not from the coffee, but from the irony. "Karma works in mysterious ways," she mused.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, his reflection a ghost of the confident tycoon he once was. The accusations were baseless, yet the damage was done. His mother, Margaret Blackwood, had called him in a frenzy, demanding answers he didn’t have.

His phone buzzed—Sophia, his sister. "We need to talk. Now."

Nathan exhaled sharply. The last thing he needed was another lecture. But when he arrived at her penthouse, Sophia wasn’t alone. Julian, their brother, leaned against the fireplace, his smirk dripping with smug satisfaction.

"Finally decided to show up?" Julian drawled. "You always did have impeccable timing."

Nathan ignored the jab. "What’s this about?"

Sophia handed him a file. "Proof that someone’s framing you."

Nathan flipped through the documents, his pulse quickening. The evidence was undeniable—someone had meticulously orchestrated his downfall. And the mastermind?

A name leaped off the page, sending a chill down his spine.

Evelyn Sinclair.

His jaw clenched. This wasn’t just revenge. This was war.


"Compile every shred of evidence against Daniel's affairs," Nathan ordered coldly into the phone.

The moment those words left his lips, it was a death sentence for Daniel's marriage. The outcome? Losing everything—years of effort vanishing overnight.

Regaining his composure, Daniel finally snapped. "You can't do this, Sophia! You started this mess, so why pin it on me now? Yes, I’m with Adriana, but I gave you the title of my wife. What more do you want?"

His audacity left the Blackwoods speechless with rage.

"Did I beg to be your wife?" Sophia shot back, voice trembling with fury.

Daniel scoffed. "Your family’s influence forced my hand! Back then, marrying you was my only ticket to staying in medicine!"

Sophia nearly choked on her anger. "Daniel, your hypocrisy is disgusting."

He froze. Never had he seen Sophia—usually composed—unleash such venom.

She’s finally awake! Isabelle’s mental shout echoed. Sophia’s right—he’s the kind of snake who bites the hand that feeds him!

Tears had threatened to spill, but hearing Isabelle’s thoughts, Sophia straightened. Chin lifted, she glared.

"You’re just a gold-digging leech."

The insult—Daniel’s most hated—hit its mark. "What did you call me?"

"A leech. You and your mistress, both parasites. Shameless, both of you!"

"Sophia, you witch!" Adriana’s shrill voice crackled through the phone, having finally pieced together the chaos. "Who’s the real thief here? You stole my man and my life! You’re the disgrace!"

Her hatred ran deep. She’d never forget Sophia’s betrayal—sleeping with Daniel mere days after their breakup.

Pregnant and desperate, she’d sought Daniel out, only to learn he’d been forced into marriage. She’d nearly aborted their child… until—

"Then why wait years to fight for him?" Sophia fired back. "Your ‘man’ clung to power by refusing to divorce. Face it—you’re just a mistress. What right do you have to scream?"

The atmosphere shifted sharply, as if someone had flipped a switch.



“That’s because your family used their influence to manipulate Daniel’s future by threatening him?” Sophia’s voice dripped with venom. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have swallowed my pride. Even if he didn’t marry me, he would’ve always loved and protected me, leaving you alone in your empty marriage. That’s the punishment you deserve.”

Evelyn couldn’t help but think, Daniel is quite the master manipulator. He’s completely fooled his mistress.

Nathan scoffed. “I may be a fool, Adriana, but so are you. Daniel, you knew damn well whether my family threatened you! And yet, you still want to play the victim now? Trying to guilt-trip me with morality? It’s obvious you chose to ride my family’s coattails for your own gain, abandoning your so-called true love! Don’t you dare twist the truth—I won’t tolerate it!”

Nathan’s words struck deep, exposing Daniel’s wounded pride. His face twisted as if she had uncovered his darkest shame.

Adriana immediately jumped to his defense. “Don’t you dare slander Daniel!”

Sophia found the whole situation laughable. “Fine. If that’s how you want to play it, let’s see how you like it when I divorce him. Then you’ll understand what it means to be truly threatened by power.”

The threat from the eldest daughter of the Blackwood family was no joke.

Daniel paled. “Sophia, what’s gotten into you?”

“Oh? Worried now?” Sophia’s voice was razor-sharp. “So you knew all along the Blackwoods never intended to harm you.”

Daniel had no rebuttal.

Seeing Sophia’s cold detachment, Beatrice finally realized her daughter-in-law was no longer the meek woman who clung to her son. Tears welled in her eyes as she reached out desperately.

“Sophie, I’ll never accept her! Daniel just lost his way. Please, give him another chance—for my sake! Look at him, he’s already suffered enough.”

But Margaret stepped between them like a protective lioness.

Beatrice grabbed Daniel, forcing him to speak. “Apologize! Do you want to ruin our family?”

She nearly shoved him to his knees. His eyes flickered with panic before he finally choked out, “I won’t divorce you, Sophie. I was wrong. It was just my pride—I couldn’t accept losing. But the truth is… I do care about you—”

“Daniel!” Adriana shrieked.

“Shut up!” he snapped at her before she could say more.

Nathan’s cold laugh shattered the moment. “The evidence of your affair is undeniable. You have no say in this, Daniel. Stop the theatrics.”

Daniel turned desperately to Sophia, but all he saw was disgust in her eyes.

A child? Adriana’s pregnant? The entire Blackwood family recoiled in disgust.

“I admit I wronged Sophie,” Daniel said suddenly, his voice hollow. “I’ll divorce her. Do whatever you want to me—just leave the others out of it.”

In an instant, he seemed like a different person. He turned away sharply, as if he couldn’t bear to face them any longer.

Did he run because he’s afraid we’ll beat him again? Evelyn wondered.

She found his sudden change suspicious. A man like Daniel should’ve fought harder.

The Blackwoods didn’t dwell on it. Right now, they just wanted the Prescotts gone.

Amid her grief, Sophia lifted her gaze from Margaret’s embrace. When her eyes met Liam’s, her heart clenched.

Noticing Nathan’s sharp glare, Daniel—still gripping Liam—suddenly yanked the boy closer.

Fear flashed across Liam’s face.

Daniel turned away, his back to the Blackwoods. His lips curled into a cruel smirk.

Sophia. The Blackwoods. You’ll regret humiliating me.

Excitement twisted his features.


Watching the despicable couple retreat, Evelyn Sinclair bit back a scathing remark. They deserve every bit of what's coming to them. Justice had finally been served, and she couldn't help but feel a twisted satisfaction.

Nathan Blackwood's gaze lingered on Evelyn, his expression unreadable. A storm of emotions flickered behind his piercing eyes.

Poor Liam. The thought gnawed at Evelyn's conscience. He'll likely face harsh punishment when he gets home. How could such vile people raise such a kind-hearted boy? Her mind raced with questions. Why would they make him call their enemy "Mother"? Was this all some twisted revenge plot? Are they truly that cruel? What kind of monsters—

Nathan, privy to Evelyn's turbulent thoughts, almost sighed aloud. She worries too much.

Of course, it's about the inheritance. His jaw tightened. Sophia Blackwood's shares, the Lawson fortune—everything hinges on Liam being recognized as Sophia's legal heir. If Sophia can't conceive, adoption is their only option. But Daniel Prescott would never accept a child not of his own blood. And now that Adriana is pregnant again... The pieces fell into place. They're sacrificing one child to secure their future. Liam is old enough to understand the truth. In the end, Sophia will be the outsider in her own family. The realization sent a chill down his spine. Thank God for Evelyn.

Lost in thought, Nathan barely registered Evelyn's sudden movement. Like an arrow loosed from a bow, she lunged toward the Lawsons just as they reached the doorway.

"No!"

Evelyn's anguished cry shattered the tense silence, startling the Blackwood family so badly that Margaret nearly stumbled.

Before anyone could react, Evelyn seized Liam's arm and delivered a sharp kick to Daniel's back, as if trying to wrench the boy free.

Liam staggered backward—only Nathan's quick reflexes saved him from crashing to the floor.

Daniel wasn't so lucky. One moment he was scheming about Liam's future; the next, he was sprawled face-first on the marble tiles, dragging Beatrice down with him. A sickening crack echoed through the manor as his nose met the unforgiving floor. His howl of pain went ignored.

The Blackwoods were too focused on Evelyn's silent fury.

System, have you lost your damn mind?! Evelyn's mental scream was laced with panic. You fed me half-truths! This wasn't just an adoption scandal—it's a disaster! Her nails dug into her palms. The records said Daniel wanted to claim his illegitimate son. Of course, I assumed Liam was Adriana's child! But no—this bastard swapped the babies Sophia and Adriana delivered nine years ago! And now he has the audacity to ask Sophia to adopt her own son?! What kind of sick, twisted—

Her breath hitched. I never imagined Liam was Sophia's biological child.

###Chapter 13

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows, painting the marble floors with streaks of light. She stood by the floor-to-ceiling glass, sipping her espresso, her mind still lingering on last night's argument with Nathan Blackwood.

He just doesn't understand.

Her phone buzzed—Victoria Hayes, her ever-efficient yet subtly scheming secretary.

"Ms. Sinclair, your 10 AM meeting with Preston Whitmore has been moved to the rooftop lounge. He insisted."

Evelyn frowned. Preston was known for his dramatic flair, but this was unusual.

The rooftop lounge of the Blackwood Tower was an exclusive space, usually reserved for high-profile negotiations. As the elevator doors slid open, Evelyn was met with an unexpected sight—Nathan, standing near the railing, deep in conversation with Preston.

Her breath hitched.

Nathan turned, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers. The tension between them crackled in the air, unspoken words hanging heavy.

Preston, ever the mediator, cleared his throat. "Ah, Evelyn! Perfect timing. I was just telling Nathan about the new project—Midnight Serenade."

Evelyn forced a smile. "I wasn’t aware you two were collaborating."

Nathan’s lips twitched. "Neither was I, until this morning."

Preston chuckled, oblivious to the undercurrents. "Well, fate works in mysterious ways. This film needs both of you—Evelyn’s vision and Nathan’s influence."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her tablet. Working with Nathan? After everything?

Before she could protest, Nathan stepped closer, his voice low. "Unless you’re afraid of a little professional proximity?"

Her spine straightened. "Hardly. I just prefer my projects drama-free."

Nathan smirked. "Then it’s settled. We’ll play nice—for the sake of the film."

Preston clapped his hands. "Excellent! First script read-through is tomorrow. Don’t be late."

As Preston walked away, Evelyn turned to leave, but Nathan caught her wrist. His touch sent an electric jolt through her.

"Running away already?" he murmured.

She yanked her arm free. "Unlike you, I have actual work to do."

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "This isn’t over, Evelyn."

She didn’t look back as she strode to the elevator, but his words echoed in her mind.

No, she thought. It’s only just begun.

A deafening roar erupted through the Blackwood manor’s grand living room, shaking the very foundations of the estate like a violent thunderstorm.

The revelation was so staggering that it left everyone frozen in shock, their eyes locked onto the nine-year-old boy standing before them.

A single thought echoed through every mind in the room: How could this be?

Even Sophia Blackwood’s breath hitched, her mind blank. She couldn’t comprehend the truth—that her child had not died, that he had been raised by Daniel Prescott, right under Adriana’s nose all these years.

That’s my son?

Liam, oblivious to the stunned gazes fixed on him, was far more concerned with the state of his father and grandmother. He tried to rush toward them, but Nathan Blackwood’s grip clamped around his wrist in an instant.

Nathan was the first to regain his composure. His dark eyes bore into Liam’s youthful face, assessing every feature.

So, Evelyn claims this is my nephew?

Years ago, Sophia had gone into premature labor. By the time the Blackwoods arrived at the private hospital they had funded for Daniel, all they found was a stillborn child.

But fate had other plans.

Nathan’s jaw tightened, his expression turning dangerously cold.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair steadied herself after the chaotic scuffle. Daniel Prescott, whom she had knocked to the ground, clutched his bloodied face, his voice a furious snarl. "You—!"

But his rage died in his throat when he saw Liam—held firmly behind Evelyn by Nathan.

And when Nathan turned that lethal gaze on him, Daniel felt his blood turn to ice.

Evelyn had no choice but to speak. "I had suspicions from the start. Liam bears an uncanny resemblance to the Blackwoods. And that woman in the video—Adriana—she looks nothing like him."

Daniel’s face paled. "W-What nonsense are you spouting?"

Here she goes again, spinning wild theories.

Evelyn knew her words might sound absurd. Matters like this weren’t to be taken lightly—especially when they involved a woman like Sophia, who had mourned a child she believed was lost forever. False hope could be devastating.

But she had no choice. No matter how outrageous it seemed, she couldn’t let that snake Daniel take Liam away. Who knew what he’d do to the boy?

Swallowing hard, Evelyn turned to Nathan. "Don’t you see it? He looks just like—"

"Like Sophia," Nathan , his voice deep and unwavering. "It’s no coincidence."

Evelyn’s eyes widened in surprise. When she met Nathan’s gaze, there was no hesitation—only absolute certainty, as if he trusted her without question.

Is he serious?

A faint smirk tugged at Nathan’s lips before he addressed Daniel. "The Blackwoods have doubts about this child’s parentage. We will verify it."

Daniel’s world tilted. Just moments ago, he had been fantasizing about revenge. Now, the tables had turned in the most brutal way possible.

"Have you all lost your minds? Liam is my son—Adriana’s and mine! Sophia’s child died years ago—!"

But the moment the words left his mouth, he realized the gravity of his mistake. Fear choked him, rendering him speechless.

Especially under Nathan’s glacial stare.

Daniel’s silence was damning.

Liam, though young, sensed something was wrong. He struggled against Nathan’s grip, desperate to reach Daniel.

Even if Daniel had always been cold and Adriana cruel—they were still the only parents he had ever known.

Then, suddenly, warm arms wrapped around him.

Sophia clutched Liam’s shoulders, her beautiful face streaked with tears. Her hands trembled as she cupped his cheeks, her breath hitching with silent sobs.

And for the first time, Liam felt an inexplicable sorrow—as if her pain had become his own.

Sophia stared at him, her heart breaking and healing all at once. The resemblance was undeniable.

Margaret Blackwood, Nathan’s mother, finally stopped making excuses. "He looks exactly like Nathan and Julian did at his age."

Half an hour later, Nathan calmly called for an ambulance.

Only then did Adriana notice Daniel—unconscious, broken—while Liam stood protected by the Blackwoods.

Liam stared at Adriana, his lips parting, but the word "Mom" wouldn’t come. Instead, all he managed was a broken whisper. "Why?"

Adriana’s face twisted with venom. "This is the debt you and your mother owe me. You should’ve died with that stillborn—just like my son!"

Liam’s world shattered.

That woman wasn’t his mother.

She was the monster who had stolen him from his real family.

Evelyn watched the scene unfold, her heart heavy. She had no desire for gossip now—only to ensure Adriana faced justice.

If only she had known Adriana’s name sooner.

If only she had seen the truth from the start.

But fate had its own cruel way of revealing secrets.

And this one had just torn a family apart—and put it back together in the most painful way possible.

The entire Prescott family was convinced that Sophia Blackwood was to blame for their misfortunes. So when Sophia gave birth to her son, Adriana demanded that Daniel compensate her by handing over the child.

Evelyn Sinclair immediately concluded that Adriana was utterly deranged.

And to preserve Daniel’s fragile ego, he agreed—as if this was the only way he could salvage his pride.

Pathetic, Evelyn thought bitterly. Then again, this was her rival’s child. How could Adriana possibly raise him with love? That was why Liam grew up with such deep-seated insecurities. All because of that shameless pair. What a tragic life for an innocent boy.

When Adriana became pregnant again, she and Daniel wanted nothing more than to shower their own child with affection. Liam had become an inconvenience—an obstacle to their happiness. That was when their cruelty truly surfaced.

Before the Blackwoods arrived, Adriana had been gloating, mocking Sophia for failing to recognize her own son even when he stood right in front of her. She had planned to keep raising her rival’s child, ensuring he remained estranged from his real family. That way, Liam would always side with her and Daniel. And when the time was right, everything would go to their real son.

But then—

Smack! Smack! Smack!

Margaret Blackwood, usually the epitome of grace, lost all composure. She struck Adriana’s face again and again, her movements frenzied, her fury unrestrained. By the time she stopped, Adriana’s cheek was swollen, blood trickling from her split lip.

Just moments ago, Adriana had been smug, reveling in her twisted victory. But now, faced with the Blackwoods’ wrath, she froze. When she finally dared to lift her head, she met Richard Blackwood’s glacial stare. He didn’t speak—didn’t need to. The sheer menace radiating from him was enough to make her blood run cold.

“I—I’m pregnant!” Adriana stammered, panic creeping into her voice. “You can’t hurt me!”

Nathan Blackwood stepped forward, his voice like steel. “We won’t touch your child. But you will answer for what you’ve done.”

If the Blackwoods weren’t bound by the law, Adriana and Daniel would already be dead.

But sometimes, living was far worse than dying.

Especially for liars like them.

###Chapter 14

The morning sun cast a golden glow over the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood slept soundly, his dark lashes brushing against his cheeks. A faint smile curved her lips as she traced the strong line of his jaw with her fingertips.

Then her phone buzzed.

Victoria Hayes’ name flashed on the screen, sending an immediate chill down Evelyn’s spine. She hesitated before swiping to read the message:

"We need to talk. Alone. The usual café. 10 AM."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Victoria never reached out unless it was something significant—or dangerous.

She slipped out of bed quietly, careful not to disturb Nathan. In the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake off the unease coiling in her stomach.

What does she want now?

Dressed in a sleek black dress and heels, Evelyn left a note for Nathan before heading out. The café was only a few blocks away, but each step felt heavier than the last.

Victoria was already there, perched elegantly at a corner table, her manicured fingers wrapped around a porcelain cup. She didn’t look up as Evelyn approached.

"You're late," Victoria remarked coolly.

Evelyn sat across from her, refusing to show any sign of intimidation. "Cut to the chase, Victoria. Why am I here?"

A slow, calculated smile spread across Victoria’s lips. She leaned forward, lowering her voice. "Nathan’s past is about to catch up with him. And if you care about him at all, you’ll want to hear what I have to say."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "What are you talking about?"

Victoria slid a sealed envelope across the table. "Open it. But be warned—once you see what’s inside, there’s no going back."

Evelyn’s fingers trembled slightly as she reached for it. The weight of the envelope suggested more than just papers.

What secret is she hiding?

Before she could open it, her phone buzzed again—this time, it was Lillian Graves, her assistant.

"Emergency at the office. You need to come now."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. She couldn’t ignore this, but she also couldn’t leave without knowing what Victoria had just handed her.

"Decide quickly, Evelyn," Victoria murmured, sipping her tea. "Time isn’t on your side."

Evelyn snatched the envelope and stood. "This isn’t over."

Victoria’s smirk deepened. "Oh, darling. It’s only just begun."

As Evelyn rushed out of the café, the envelope burned in her grip like a ticking bomb.

What the hell did Nathan do?

And more importantly—was she ready to face the truth?

As night descended, all pressing matters had to be postponed until morning.

On the spot, Nathan Blackwood renamed Liam as Theodore Prescott, welcoming the boy into the Blackwood estate to live with Sophia.

Theodore could barely keep his eyes open upon arrival. Despite the emotional whirlwind, he was still a growing child who couldn't fight exhaustion any longer.

Sophia refused to leave her son's side, clinging to him as if he might disappear again.

Richard and Margaret came to admire their grandson, their expressions overflowing with affection.

Finally, Nathan made his appearance.

"Where's Evelyn?" Margaret inquired.

Nathan replied, "She's retired to her chambers for the night."

The Blackwood family convened immediately - all except Theodore, who slept soundly in his new bedroom.

"What in heaven's name is happening? Can we truly hear Evelyn's innermost thoughts?" Richard demanded.

Nathan recounted the day's bizarre events at the corporation. "Currently, only a select few of us possess this ability."

"We can't hear her now, correct?" Margaret asked, perplexed.

"It's a proximity matter," Nathan explained. "Like normal conversation - too far away, and the words fade."

"I owe her everything this time," Sophia murmured, still shaken. "She saved both me and Theo. But how did she obtain such information?" The events had unfolded with dizzying speed, leaving her questioning reality itself.

Had Evelyn not revealed the truth, Sophia and Theodore might have lived their entire lives as strangers. The mere thought sent chills down her spine.

"I suspect she recently acquired this... ability," Nathan theorized. "Our hearing her thoughts must be an unintended side effect. I propose we maintain appearances for now. When Julian and Genevieve return, we'll see if they're affected too."

The supernatural development left everyone baffled. For now, inaction seemed the only prudent course.

"Evelyn seems... different," Sophia remarked, a nostalgic tone coloring her voice.

When Sophia had married, Evelyn had only recently been reintroduced to the Blackwood family. Their interactions had been limited, and Sophia remembered her as somewhat withdrawn. After the wedding, she'd constantly heard her mother lamenting Nathan and Evelyn's troubled marriage.

"Truthfully, Evelyn's always been eccentric," Margaret mused. "But since her parents' tragic passing..." Her voice trailed off meaningfully.

The family sat in contemplative silence, each lost in their own thoughts about the mysterious woman who had suddenly become the center of their supernatural predicament. Outside, the moon cast long shadows across the Blackwood estate, as if nature itself sensed the extraordinary shift in their lives.

Sophia glanced toward the staircase where Theodore slept peacefully, unaware of the storm brewing around them. She reached for her husband Daniel's hand, drawing strength from his steady presence. Whatever strange power Evelyn now wielded, one thing was certain - nothing in the Blackwood family would ever be the same again.

Margaret sighed as she watched her son, Nathan, pace the room. "After all she's been through with her relatives, Evelyn seemed so broken—completely different from the cheerful girl she used to be. But lately… she’s starting to resemble her old self again."

Richard placed a reassuring hand on Nathan’s shoulder. "At the end of the day, Evelyn didn’t just solve your problems—she saved Sophia and Theodore too. You should repay her properly."

Sophia giggled, recalling the day’s events. "Evelyn might act tough, but deep down, she’s got a heart of gold. You should be more understanding with her from now on."

Margaret nodded in agreement. "Since you agreed to marry her, don’t let her suffer the way I did."

They all hoped Nathan would finally see Evelyn’s worth—that their marriage could blossom into something real. If not, they’d rather they part amicably than drown in resentment.

One thing was certain—they had never shared a room.

Nathan’s mind immediately jumped to Evelyn’s obsession with money. "I’ll just give her cash. That’ll make her happy."

The three of them exchanged exasperated glances.

Is it really money she wants, or you? Can money ever replace love?

Nathan, sensing their disapproval, shrugged. "She loves money. If I reward her financially, she’ll be thrilled."

They didn’t argue, though they questioned his emotional intelligence.

Then, Nathan frowned. "Never mind. She’s terrible with money. I’ll invest it for her instead."

The trio was baffled but secretly pleased. At least he was showing some concern.

In truth, Nathan had just remembered Evelyn’s reckless spending habits. His lips twitched. If we stay married, she’ll get her share. But if we divorce? I’m not funding her search for a younger man.

No matter how careful he was, he couldn’t shake the fear of betrayal.

When Nathan returned home, he planned to discuss investing Evelyn’s money with her.

Before he could knock, a shriek erupted from inside.

Evelyn’s thoughts and words were always worlds apart—once you got used to it, you could tell the difference.

"I’m rich! Why are Richard, Margaret, and Sophia all giving me money?! Oh my God, they’re thanking me for exposing everything! They’re so sweet—good deeds really do pay off! With what I already had, I’ve got two million now. Wait—no, TEN million! I actually made ten million in a single day!"

The mere thought sent shivers down Evelyn's spine. Oh, the sheer exhilaration! Even if this marriage to Nathan Blackwood crumbled and she walked away with nothing, she had no reason to fear. Young lovers, rebellious heartthrobs, chiseled abs—oh, the possibilities!

Inside the lavish bedroom, Evelyn sprawled across the silk sheets, her phone clutched tightly as she fired off grateful replies to well-wishers. Just as she tapped send, a firm knock echoed through the room.

Frowning, she padded to the door and swung it open—only to freeze.

Nathan loomed in the doorway, his towering frame blocking the light. His expression was unreadable, but the intensity in his dark, lash-fringed eyes sent an inexplicable thrill through her.

"Give me all your money," he commanded, his voice low and smooth.

Evelyn blinked. "Excuse me?"

"I'll invest it for you," he continued, unfazed. "Guaranteed returns."

Her mouth fell open. Was this some kind of joke?

"Think it over," he said, already turning away. "Come find me when you decide."

And just like that, he was gone, leaving Evelyn standing there, utterly bewildered.

In her past life, she had been a corporate drone—exhausted, overworked, and underpaid. This time around, she had vowed to live differently. The original Evelyn Sinclair had dabbled in modeling, coasting by on her looks rather than talent. Most of her gigs had been handed to her through connections, leaving her bank account far from impressive.

The Blackwood family had once funded her whims, but after the wedding, Nathan had taken over—despite their strained relationship, he never restricted her spending. His black card was always active, a silent allowance she had grown accustomed to.

But this Evelyn wasn’t comfortable relying on a man’s money. She wanted security—her own security.

So when Nathan proposed managing her finances, she was intrigued.

After all, what did she know about investments? She had been a salarywoman, not a financial prodigy like Nathan Blackwood.

Mind made up, she marched to his room.

Minutes ticked by with no response. Her patience frayed.

What the hell? He told me to come!

Unbeknownst to her, her mental grumbling carried down the hallway, reaching the ears of Sophia Blackwood and her two accomplices. Curiosity piqued, they cracked open their doors, peeking out like nosy spectators.

Has Nathan finally come to his senses? Is he inviting Evelyn into his bed?

The trio nearly squealed in excitement.

Just as Evelyn was about to give up and storm off, the door swung open.

And the sight before her stole her breath.

Nathan stood there, clad only in a loosely tied robe, his damp hair glistening under the warm light. Water droplets trailed down his neck, disappearing beneath the fabric that barely clung to his sculpted chest. One hand held a towel, the other braced against the doorframe.

His usually sharp, composed features were softened by the steam, his lips a sinful shade of red against his flushed skin.

And then—oh God—the robe slipped.

Just a fraction.

Enough to reveal the hard planes of his abdomen, the defined ridges of muscle that made Evelyn’s pulse skyrocket.

One… two… three…

She lost count.

Nathan arched a brow, watching her with amused curiosity.

Damn those shoulders. Those abs. That—everything. I might actually pass out.

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. He didn’t adjust his robe. Didn’t even try to hide the view.

Instead, he leaned in slightly, letting the fabric gape wider.

Evelyn swallowed hard.

This man was dangerous.

The morning sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn Sinclair stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the warm sheets beside her. The space was empty, but the lingering scent of Nathan Blackwood’s cologne teased her senses.

A smirk curled her lips as she recalled last night—his hands tracing the contours of her waist, his whispered promises against her skin. But what truly stood out in her memory?

Those damn abs.

Eight perfectly defined ridges, each one a testament to discipline and raw masculinity. She had traced them with her fingertips, memorizing every dip and curve. It was unfair, really, how effortlessly he carried such perfection.

The bathroom door creaked open, steam rolling out in soft tendrils. Nathan emerged, a towel slung low around his hips, water droplets glistening on his toned chest. His dark hair was still damp, tousled in that infuriatingly attractive way.

Evelyn propped herself up on one elbow, her gaze shamelessly raking over him. "Good morning, Mr. Blackwood. Or should I say… good abs?"

Nathan arched a brow, amusement flickering in his stormy gray eyes. "Is that all you noticed?"

"Oh, I noticed plenty," she purred, dragging a finger along the edge of the sheet. "But let’s be honest—those abs deserve their own fan club."

He chuckled, the sound rich and warm as he approached the bed. "Jealous?"

"Please," she scoffed, though her eyes betrayed her fascination. "I could have abs like that if I wanted."

Nathan leaned down, bracing his hands on either side of her, his face inches from hers. "But then you wouldn’t have time for your other talents," he murmured, his breath hot against her lips.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Damn him and his ability to turn a simple conversation into something charged.

Before she could retort, his phone buzzed on the nightstand. Victoria Hayes’ name flashed across the screen.

Nathan straightened, his expression shifting to something unreadable. "I have to take this."

Evelyn flopped back onto the pillows with a dramatic sigh. "Of course you do."

As he stepped away, she couldn’t help but admire the view one last time—the way his muscles flexed with each movement, the way his back tapered into that sinful V.

Eight-pack abs.

She groaned, throwing an arm over her face.

This man was going to be the death of her.
###Chapter 15

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she stared at her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirror. The emerald-green evening gown hugged her curves perfectly, but her fingers trembled as she adjusted the diamond choker around her neck. Tonight was the Blackwood Charity Gala—and Nathan Blackwood would be there.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Lillian Graves, her assistant: "Car’s ready. Press is already swarming the venue. Stay sharp—Victoria Hayes just arrived with Julian Blackwood."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s cunning secretary, had been circling Julian like a vulture for weeks. Rumor had it she’d leaked false scandals to sabotage Evelyn’s reputation.

The gala hall glittered under crystal chandeliers, the air thick with perfume and whispered alliances. Nathan stood near the champagne tower, his charcoal suit cutting a severe silhouette against the opulence. His gaze locked onto Evelyn the moment she entered, dark and unreadable.

Before she could approach him, Victoria materialized at Julian’s side, her crimson dress a deliberate provocation. “Evelyn,” she purred, “how brave of you to show up after that tabloid disaster.”

Julian’s brow furrowed. “What tabloid disaster?”

Evelyn’s nails dug into her clutch. So this was Victoria’s play.

Nathan stepped forward, his voice a blade of ice. “Julian, the investors from Tokyo are waiting. Hayes, with me.”

Victoria’s smirk faltered as Nathan gripped her elbow, steering her away. But not before she shot Evelyn a look dripping with venom.

Evelyn retreated to the terrace, the cool night air a relief. Footsteps echoed behind her.

“Running away?” Nathan’s voice was low, rough at the edges.

She turned. “Just avoiding your secretary’s theatrics.”

He moved closer, the scent of sandalwood and something darker enveloping her. “Victoria’s irrelevant. But you—” His thumb brushed her wrist, igniting a traitorous spark. “—are a distraction I can’t afford.”

A crash inside the ballroom shattered the moment. Screams erupted.

Nathan’s phone blared—Marcus Donovan, Julian’s agent, frantic: "It’s Julian. He’s been poisoned."

The terrace doors burst open. Lillian, pale-faced: "Evelyn, they’re saying it was in his drink. And your fingerprints are on the glass."

Nathan’s eyes turned glacial. “Did you?”

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Someone had framed her. And with Julian fighting for his life, Nathan’s trust was already crumbling.

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse. She stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathan Blackwood had left early—again.

A soft chime from her phone interrupted her thoughts. A message from Preston Whitmore, her director, flashed on the screen: "Emergency reshoot. Studio in an hour."

Evelyn groaned. She had planned to spend the day reviewing scripts, but Hollywood never waited.

As she stepped into her walk-in closet, her fingers traced the silk of a midnight-blue gown—the one Nathan had gifted her after their first red carpet together. A small smile tugged at her lips before she shook her head. No distractions today.

The studio was chaos. Crew members darted between sets, and Donovan Sharpe, the producer, barked orders into his headset. Evelyn slipped into her trailer, where Lillian Graves, her assistant, waited with a steaming cup of matcha.

"Morning, sunshine," Lillian teased. "You look like you could use this."

Evelyn took the cup gratefully. "Bless you. Any idea what the reshoot’s about?"

Lillian lowered her voice. "Rumor has it, Seraphina Delacroix messed up her lines—again—and Preston lost it."

Evelyn sighed. Seraphina, the second-tier actress with a penchant for drama, had been a thorn in everyone’s side since filming began.

On set, tension crackled in the air. Preston paced near the monitors, his jaw clenched. Seraphina stood in the center, batting her lashes at Sebastian Hart, her ex and co-star, who looked thoroughly unamused.

Evelyn took her mark, exchanging a quick glance with Sebastian. His smirk told her everything—today would be fun.

"Action!" Preston called.

The scene unfolded smoothly until—

"Wait, what?" Seraphina gasped mid-line, staring past Evelyn.

A hush fell over the set. Evelyn turned.

Nathan Blackwood stood in the doorway, his presence commanding the room. His gaze locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. What was he doing here?

Then he spoke, his voice low but clear.

"We need to talk."

The set erupted into whispers. Preston groaned, rubbing his temples.

Evelyn swallowed hard. Whatever this was, it couldn’t be good.

The moment those embarrassing words slipped out, the Blackwood family exchanged awkward glances. Yet, beneath their discomfort, anticipation simmered—what would happen next?

Could tonight be the night?

"I was in the shower," Nathan explained, his deep voice laced with amusement. "That’s why it took me so long to answer the door."

"Oh, that’s... fine." Good save. Smooth.

Evelyn forced herself to look away from Nathan’s unfairly distracting frame, her cheeks warming.

Nathan’s lips quirked. "So, have you made up your mind?"

The Blackwoods held their breath.

"Actually, I have ten million now. Would you be willing to invest it for me?"

Sophia nearly choked on her drink.

Nathan simply nodded.

Evelyn tilted her head. "But I need to know—how can you guarantee profits? All investments carry risks."

His reply was immediate. "If there’s a loss, I’ll cover it. Your principal is completely secure."

Huh.

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard by the unexpected perk.

Nathan continued smoothly, "Consider it my thanks for helping my family again."

She accepted the credit without hesitation—after all, she had done them a massive favor. No point in false modesty.

"I’ll transfer the money later—wait, actually, let’s just invest nine million."

Nathan raised a brow at her sudden change.

I’ll keep a million handy, just in case.

Evelyn tapped her chin. "Is there an option for monthly dividends?"

That way, I’ll have steady income. No more financial stress.

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly. "If you need money, just use the card I gave you."

"I know," she laughed, "but what’s wrong with wanting to celebrate profits every month?"

Absolutely nothing—except that card is under my name, and your favorite punishment is freezing it. I won’t risk being broke if you ever get mad at me.

The flicker of insecurity in Evelyn’s eyes didn’t escape Nathan. His gaze sharpened.

She still doesn’t trust me.


"Understood. The final payment for your last job has been processed. You should receive it by tomorrow—around one million. So, let’s keep the total investment at ten million, agreed?"

"What? Seriously? Wasn’t I just scraping by on ad revenue before? How did it jump so high?" Evelyn Sinclair blinked in disbelief. Had the original host been so oblivious that she’d misremembered everything?

"This one’s… unusually generous," Nathan Blackwood lied smoothly, and Evelyn bought it instantly. Her delighted laughter rang in his mind like wind chimes.

The three eavesdroppers exchanged glances, pitying Evelyn. Clearly, all her insecurities stemmed from Nathan’s failure to make her feel secure.

Fine. From now on, we’ll just shower her with money. That ought to fix it.

Nathan suddenly shivered, sensing impending doom. After a beat, he cleared his throat. "If you ever have extra funds, hand them to me. I’ll add them to your investment portfolio."

Nathan, you’re perfect—except for refusing to share my bed!

Nathan choked on air.

Not sharing her bed?! The eavesdroppers mouthed to each other, scandalized.

If only I could sleep with him just once…

Nathan’s ears burned crimson. His gaze, previously sharp, now flitted anywhere but Evelyn’s face.

The trio mentally cheered Evelyn on. If Nathan could hear her thoughts, maybe her boldness would finally break through his defenses.

Come to think of it… has any woman ever succeeded with him? I’m sure I haven’t!

Nathan tensed. She’s about to spill something disastrous again.

The eavesdroppers sighed. Back when the incident happened, even they hadn’t known the full truth. The rumors had forced Nathan into damage control.

Wait… seriously?

They frowned at Evelyn’s shock.

Nathan’s gut twisted with dread.

No way. Nathan’s still a virgin?! Holy—

Nathan’s soul left his body.

The trio gaped. Virgin?! The man’s dated, married, and flirted with half of Hollywood!

Hahaha!

Nathan’s eyes narrowed, his cheeks flaming. He could only glare as Evelyn’s shoulders shook with suppressed laughter.

What’s so funny?! This is outrageous!

Not only was she mentally cackling, but her face was contorting from the effort to stay quiet.

Worse—Nathan’s sharp gaze snapped toward the far hallway. Had he just heard… snickering?

The eavesdroppers scrambled back from the door crack.

Okay, we’re busted. This was a private moment they’d never meant to intrude on.

After an awkward pause, curiosity won. They peeked just in time to see Nathan yank Evelyn into the room amid her mental giggles.

Ooh, is something spicy happening?

They crowded the door again, but it was shut tight now, muffling Evelyn’s inner monologue.

Inside, Evelyn’s thoughts had gone silent—only her racing heartbeat filled the space. She stared at Nathan, wide-eyed. "What are you doing?"

Finally free of her mental teasing, Nathan exhaled. "Drafting your power of attorney," he muttered, shooting her a half-hearted glare.

Evelyn beamed, thrilled by his efficiency. Nathan, however, seethed. Even if he’d stopped her from blabbing his secret, her incessant mental commentary was unbearable.

Helpless, he scribbled the agreement, his face still burning.

Unbelievable. A man like Nathan, still untouched? Even if he’s principled, surely his first love counted as innocent? Unless… he can’t perform? Nah, not with those abs—

Thud. The printed agreement slapped onto the desk, cutting off her shameless speculation.

Evelyn pored over the document, oblivious to Nathan’s stormy expression.

With the signed contract secured, Evelyn departed with a spring in her step. She slept like a log until the golden morning sun streamed through her windows, only to be roused by the ping of her bank notification—the final payment had cleared.

A cool million. Exactly as promised.

Descending the stairs, she found Margaret and Sophia deep in conversation with Nathan. The trio glanced up at the sound of her footsteps.

Evelyn hesitated. Did I commit some social faux pas by sleeping in?

Margaret recovered first, offering a warm chuckle. "Sleep is precious, darling. Rest as much as you need—young people keep different hours than us old folks."

Sophia nodded conspiratorially. "I used to sleep till noon at your age."

Nathan shot his mother a skeptical look—he'd seen her sipping coffee at dawn when he woke. Noticing his gaze, Sophia flushed and amended, "Well, occasionally."

Evelyn recognized their kindness for what it was—a deliberate effort to put her at ease.

Margaret summoned a maid to bring Evelyn a light snack. "We're having a ladies' lunch today," she explained. "Richard and Julian are tied up with that unpleasant business regarding Victoria."

Nathan's jaw tightened at the mention. His father rarely handled legal matters personally, but the Lawson affair demanded nothing less.

Evelyn settled onto the sofa.

"Good morning, Aunt Evelyn," Theodore greeted politely, though his fingers twisted the hem of his shirt. The boy still moved through the mansion like a ghost unsure of its welcome.

Margaret and Sophia exchanged pained glances. Their resentment toward Daniel Prescott and Adriana grew by the hour—how dare they make this child feel like an outsider in his own family?

The silence thickened like custard left out too long.

Then Evelyn remembered—Theodore loved puzzles. Rubik's cubes, Legos, model kits. Though Adriana had deemed the latter two "frivolous expenses," refusing to buy them despite the Prescott fortune.

Before she could mention it, Margaret smoothly redirected the conversation. "Did you know, Theo? Your uncles Julian and Nathan were Lego fanatics. We've got crates of them in the attic."

Sophia added, "Would you like to—"

Their words weren't mere placation. That afternoon, not only were the vintage sets brought down, but delivery trucks arrived with enough new kits to stock a toy store.

The sight of Theodore's hesitant smile thawed the lingering frost in the room.

A week later, the storm clouds cleared. Richard had handled everything with surgical precision—the divorce, the police reports, the lawsuits. Every loose end neatly tied.

Yet as Evelyn watched Theodore carefully assemble his first model plane, she couldn't shake the feeling that the real challenges were just beginning.

The private hospital owned by the Prescott family collapsed, leaving Daniel drowning in insurmountable debt. With no way out, he had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.

The entire Prescott family was left destitute, forced to live on the streets. Beatrice tried to make a scene multiple times, but since they were no longer connected by marriage, she couldn’t even get past the security.

Richard made sure no member of the Prescott family would ever get another chance to see Sophia or Theodore again.

Daniel and Adriana were both facing prison time. However, when it was discovered that Adriana was pregnant, Daniel, for once, stepped up. He took full responsibility, ensuring Adriana walked away without charges.

But Adriana wasn’t moved by his sacrifice. Whether it was her shattered hopes for the future or the betrayal she felt from Daniel’s deception, she couldn’t say. With Beatrice too distracted to watch her closely, Adriana lost the child and then disappeared without a trace.

In the end, when disaster struck, every one of them only cared about themselves. When Daniel learned what had happened, he flew into a rage in prison, earning himself an extended sentence.

Within ten days, the Prescott family vanished from the city.

Not long after, Theodore transferred schools and started anew.

Before that, the Blackwood family had thrown a grand reunion banquet to celebrate their reunion with Theodore.

As Evelyn scanned the guest list, she couldn’t help but feel a twinge of regret.

"I only know the names, not the faces. Otherwise, I could check in advance for any juicy gossip to feast on."

High society was always brimming with drama.

The Blackwoods, gathered on the couch discussing the list, suddenly found themselves distracted. It was impossible not to—no one could resist eavesdropping on gossip.

Lately, Evelyn had uncovered quite a few interesting tidbits. She’d even discovered the secret affection the butler held for the housekeeper. Every day, she quietly reveled in their budding romance.

"By the way, will Julian make it? Didn’t they say he was filming in some remote mountain area with no signal?" Richard asked.

Julian, the third son of the Blackwood family, was one of the most sought-after actors in the entertainment industry.

Nathan glanced up. "I got a message from Julian. He just wrapped up filming and promised he’d be back. He also mentioned he has something important to discuss."

At those words, the entire Blackwood family fell silent, their expressions shifting subtly.

Curious, Evelyn glanced around, unable to resist activating her Gossip System.

Ah, so that’s it.

Julian wanted to change the betrothal agreement.

Now that sounded familiar.

He was—

The Blackwood family sat in stunned silence as Evelyn's revelation hung in the air. Currently engaged to Celeste Cowell, the eldest daughter of the prestigious Cowell family, Julian had always shown undeniable affection for her younger sister Isabelle. While Celeste struggled with society's disapproval, Isabelle basked in universal admiration.

This news came as no surprise to the Blackwoods. Julian's behavior over the years had spoken volumes. The progressive family never interfered with their children's romantic choices, though they worried Julian's impulsive nature might complicate matters unnecessarily.

When Evelyn confirmed Julian's intention to switch engagements upon his return, they agreed to address the situation together as a family. Just as the weight of this decision settled upon them, Evelyn released a heavy sigh.

"Love works in mysterious ways," she murmured. "When Julian nearly died as a child, it was Celeste who saved him. Yet destiny played its cruel joke - he fell for her sister instead."

Gasps echoed through the room. The Blackwoods exchanged bewildered glances. Wait—what? Their family records clearly showed Isabelle as Julian's childhood savior, not Celeste.

The grandfather clock's ticking grew louder in the sudden silence. Margaret's teacup clattered against its saucer. Nathan's fingers tightened around the armrests of his chair. Sophia's eyes darted between family members, searching for answers.

A cold realization crept through Evelyn's veins. If their memories contradicted this fundamental truth, what other illusions had they been living under? The foundation of Julian's engagement—of his entire relationship with the Cowell sisters—might rest upon a dangerous misconception.

Outside, storm clouds gathered, mirroring the turmoil within. The truth, when it came, would rewrite more than just one engagement. It threatened to unravel years of carefully constructed relationships and expose secrets better left buried.

For in high society, where reputation meant everything, some truths could destroy lives. And this particular truth involved more than just mistaken identities—it hinted at deliberate deception with consequences none of them could yet fathom.
###Chapter 16

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the grand ballroom, all eyes turned toward her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the room, but it was her presence that truly illuminated the space. She wore a deep emerald gown that hugged her curves, the delicate lace sleeves brushing against her wrists as she moved.

Nathan Blackwood stood near the balcony doors, a glass of whiskey in hand, his sharp gaze tracking her every step. He had known she would be here tonight—had planned for it—but seeing her in person still sent a jolt through him.

"Mr. Blackwood," a voice purred beside him. Victoria Hayes, his ever-persistent secretary, sidled closer, her crimson lips curved in a knowing smile. "I see you’ve noticed our guest of honor."

Nathan didn’t bother responding. His attention remained fixed on Evelyn as she exchanged pleasantries with Preston Whitmore, the acclaimed director. The way she laughed—soft, genuine—made something tighten in his chest.

Then, as if sensing his stare, Evelyn turned. Their eyes locked.

A beat of silence.

A challenge.

She arched a brow, the faintest smirk playing at her lips before she deliberately turned away, dismissing him as effortlessly as one might a passing stranger.

Nathan’s grip on his glass tightened.

Oh, she was good.

Too good.

And he loved a challenge.

Across the room, Lillian Graves, Evelyn’s ever-loyal assistant, leaned in. "You’re playing with fire," she murmured.

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. "And isn’t that the most fun part?"

Meanwhile, Marcus Donovan, Julian Blackwood’s agent, watched the exchange with keen interest. He had his own agenda tonight—one that involved ensuring Nathan’s carefully constructed world began to unravel.

And Evelyn Sinclair?

She was the perfect spark to ignite it all.

The night was young.

And the game had only just begun.

The day of the grand party arrived, and Nathan returned home earlier than usual to oversee the final preparations.

In the lavish dressing room reserved for styling, he found Evelyn already transformed—her makeup flawless, her gown perfectly fitted.

Evelyn looked strikingly different tonight. Gone were the days of heavy, dramatic makeup and ostentatious jewelry that screamed for attention. She no longer resembled the bold, crimson rose demanding admiration. Instead, she radiated effortless elegance.

She wore a delicate pale yellow gown that swayed with every movement, accentuated by a single strand of pearls around her neck. Her long, silky hair cascaded down her back with just the slightest curl at the ends, framing her face with soft sophistication.

When Nathan entered, she lifted the hem of her dress slightly and glided toward him with effortless grace.

"Your mother just called," Evelyn said, adjusting his tie with nimble fingers. "She wants us to greet the guests together."

Nathan gave a curt nod, but before he could respond, he caught her scrutinizing him—her gaze sweeping from his polished shoes to his perfectly styled hair.

Damn, he looks good enough without any extra effort, she thought, biting back a smirk.

Nathan shifted uncomfortably. Unlike his brother Julian, he never cared much for appearances.

Clearing his throat, he gestured toward the door. "We should go."

Just as they were about to leave, Sophia entered with Theodore in tow, leading him toward the makeup chair.

The moment they saw Evelyn, both Sophia and Theodore froze, momentarily stunned by her breathtaking transformation.

Sophia chuckled, nudging her son. "Look how stunning your Aunt Evelyn is tonight."

Theodore nodded obediently. "She's really pretty."

Evelyn flushed at the compliment and quickly deflected, crouching slightly to meet Theodore’s gaze. "Tell me, Theo—who’s prettier? Me or your mom?"

As expected, the boy’s cheeks turned pink. "Mom is the prettiest," he mumbled.

Sophia’s eyes softened as she ruffled his hair, her heart swelling with affection. The bond between them had deepened so quickly—no one would guess they had been separated for nearly a decade.

As for Daniel and Adriana, their neglect had made it easy for Theodore to move on. These days, he barely thought of them.

"Oh, by the way," Sophia added with a sigh, "Genevieve won’t be able to make it. She’s on that art expedition overseas—you know how rare those opportunities are. She sent Theo a gift and apologized over video call."

Genevieve, the youngest of the Blackwood siblings, was still in university, currently halfway across the world on an artistic journey.

Nathan gave an understanding nod before leading Evelyn to the grand entrance to greet their guests.

As the guests arrived in waves, Evelyn couldn’t help but notice the weight of their stares—few were warm. Most were scrutinizing, judgmental, even hostile.

The recent scandal involving Blackwood Group had sent shockwaves through high society. Not only had they held a high-profile press conference to clear the air, but they had also terminated several employees. Most notably, they had blacklisted Evelyn’s former manager and demanded compensation from her.

This was widely seen as Nathan’s public declaration of support for his estranged wife.

At the time, many had assumed the scandal would lead to their inevitable divorce. Countless socialites had already begun scheming, eager to position themselves as the next Mrs. Blackwood—even if it meant being his second wife.

Now, as they stood side by side, those same schemers could only seethe in silence.

Too bad for them. I’m still very much married to Nathan. Their little fantasies just went up in smoke. Evelyn smirked inwardly.

Nathan’s lips twitched imperceptibly at her smug thoughts, though his expression remained perfectly composed as he greeted each guest with practiced ease.

Before long, the Cowells arrived—but instead of the expected four, only three stepped through the door.

Behind the middle-aged couple stood a woman with an air of detached indifference. While the others wore polite smiles, she seemed utterly disinterested, her presence cold and aloof.

Dressed in a simple black gown with no jewelry, her long, unstyled hair framing sharp features, she looked nothing like the polished heiresses of high society.

"Nathan, it’s been too long. You’ve only grown more impressive," Edward Cowell greeted warmly, shaking Nathan’s hand with enthusiasm.

Penelope, flashing a practiced smile, chimed in with equal fervor. Like most social climbers, her attention was reserved solely for Nathan. Evelyn might as well have been invisible.

Not that Evelyn cared. Instead, she studied them with quiet amusement.

The more faces I remember, the juicier the gossip later.

Her gaze landed on the woman at the back. When their eyes met, the woman offered a polite, almost imperceptible nod.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Are you Celeste… or Isabelle?"

She had seen her a few times before, but the twins were nearly indistinguishable. Even now, she wasn’t entirely sure which one stood before her.

The woman’s lips curved slightly—not quite a smile, but something close.

"Does it matter?"

Evelyn blinked.

Interesting.

The game had just gotten a lot more intriguing.

After all, they were identical twins.

"I'm Celeste."

The sudden shift in Celeste's tone didn't escape Edward and Penelope. Their smiles faltered for a split second before they quickly recovered, plastering on practiced grins. "Our Isabelle is busy filming today, so she couldn't make it," they began, their voices dripping with false modesty.

Before they could finish, the roar of an engine cut through the air. A sleek sports car pulled up, its doors swinging open with dramatic flair.

Julian stepped out, removing his sunglasses to reveal a face strikingly similar to Nathan's—though where Nathan carried an air of refined authority, Julian exuded reckless charm.

"What a shame," someone murmured nearby. "He's already taken, otherwise..."

But speculation was cut short as Julian strode to the passenger side and opened the door.

The woman who emerged had the same long, dark hair as Celeste—the same delicate features, the same porcelain skin. But where Celeste's sharp gaze held defiance, this woman's eyes were soft, her demeanor gentle. She wore an elegant white gown, every movement graceful.

The crowd buzzed. High society thrived on gossip, and this was a spectacle too delicious to ignore. Whispers spread like wildfire, eyes darting between the twins.

Penelope's grip tightened on Edward's arm. "Celeste," she said, voice strained with forced cheer, "why don't you greet your sister?"

Celeste didn't move. Her lips curled into a cold smile.

Julian, meanwhile, guided Isabelle forward, his expression unreadable. When he glanced at Celeste, there was no warmth—only a silent challenge.

Before he could speak, a voice cut through the tension.

"Julian."

The crowd parted.

Standing there, arms crossed, was none other than Isabelle herself—the woman who had just stepped out of the car.

The guests froze.

Because the woman beside Julian wasn't Isabelle.

She was someone else entirely.

And the real Isabelle?

She was staring straight at Celeste, her eyes burning with something far from sisterly affection.

The game had just begun.
###Chapter 17


As Evelyn's string of complaints reached Nathan's ears, he noticed Julian had frozen mid-step. The younger man looked as if he'd seen a ghost. Nathan immediately grasped the situation.

Before Julian could speak, Nathan intervened, his voice carrying an unspoken weight. "Julian, stay here and help me with the guests." Though not quite a command, the words effortlessly shifted focus from the previous topic.

"Let me assist Isabelle inside first—she's having trouble moving," Julian began, but the disruptive voice cut through again.

Is he dense? Her parents and sister are right there! Since when is it his turn to play knight in shining armor? Evelyn's mental tirade continued. Even if they were dating—which they clearly aren't—Nathan's practically spelling out how inappropriate this is. Is love really making him this obtuse?

Julian stiffened as the invisible barrage of insults hit him. Humiliation and anger flared. He whirled toward Evelyn, teeth clenched. "You—"

"Hmm?" Evelyn blinked, genuinely perplexed.

She assumed Julian was attempting a greeting, albeit with unusual hostility. Their relationship had always been strained—ever since childhood, Julian had idolized Nathan while resenting Evelyn, his brother's wife. Despite sharing the entertainment industry, Julian had never acknowledged her as family, publicly or privately.

Yet he'd never confronted her directly—until now.

"Julian?" Isabelle whispered, confused by his abrupt halt. From her angle, she couldn't see his glare directed at Evelyn, assuming instead he was staring at Celeste beside her.

Her lower lip trembled. "You should stay with Celeste," she said, shoving Julian away with fragile dignity. "I'll manage alone."

Celeste, who'd remained silent, arched a brow. "Mr. Blackwood asked Mr. Julian to assist with the guests. Why am I suddenly involved?"

Isabelle's eyes widened, tears welling instantly as if struck by unbearable injustice.

"What's this attitude?" Edward and Penelope swooped in, shields raised. "Must you always antagonize your sister? We never should've brought you!"

The air crackled with unspoken tensions as the family drama unfolded beneath the glittering chandeliers.

Meanwhile, oblivious to Isabelle’s tearful expression, Julian turned his head and met Evelyn’s icy gaze. Did she just call me Mr. Blackwood? She always used to call me Julian.

A strange discomfort twisted in Julian’s chest, but before he could dwell on it, Evelyn’s sharp voice cut through the tension.

"I can’t stand this any longer. I may not know Celeste well, but this isn’t right."

"Earlier, my husband only asked for Julian to stay. He never mentioned Celeste. Why did you bring her up?" Evelyn’s tone wasn’t accusatory—just curious, laced with a quiet demand for answers. It was a tactic that often worked.

The moment Evelyn posed the question, the room fell into an uneasy silence. A heavy, almost eerie atmosphere settled over the party, and the guests exchanged glances as if seeing the situation in a new light.

Wait, where did that even come from?

It was one thing for Julian to stay behind to entertain guests, but expecting Celeste to do the same? Somehow, in Isabelle’s version, it had twisted into Julian keeping Celeste company. How did that happen?

Edward and Penelope immediately jumped to Isabelle’s defense, sensing Evelyn’s thinly veiled hostility. They opened their mouths to argue, but Nathan unexpectedly spoke first.

"There seems to be a misunderstanding. I only mentioned my brother."

Then he glanced at Evelyn, who looked ready for a fight. A flicker of satisfaction crossed his face when he noticed she had called him husband instead of ex-husband.

Their silent understanding left Isabelle flushed with humiliation, momentarily speechless. She could only stare at Julian with wide, helpless eyes.

Julian, too, was stunned.

"Besides," Evelyn continued smoothly, "your sister was just correcting you earlier. Why are you acting like you’ve been wronged? Having your father scold her in public only makes things worse. As hosts, is there any conflict we can help resolve?" She shifted her gaze from Isabelle to the Cowells.

Isabelle, who had always been poised and confident, faltered. She froze, unable to respond.

The Cowells were equally dumbfounded, struggling to comprehend how the situation had spiraled so quickly.

"Unless you think we’ve been inhospitable?" Nathan added, his voice devoid of emotion.

The Cowells could only stammer, their frustration boiling beneath the surface but unable to find the right words.

The next instant, Evelyn flashed Isabelle a radiant smile, her tone dripping with honeyed concern. "Darling, there's something quite odd about what you just said. What do you mean by letting Julian escort Celeste? Are you implying you can manage alone? You really shouldn’t speak like that."

The crowd around them froze. Was Evelyn subtly acknowledging Julian and Isabelle as a couple on behalf of the Blackwoods? Was she chastising Isabelle for belittling herself?

For a fleeting moment, Isabelle forgot their earlier clash. Her eyes shimmered with hesitant hope as she stared at Evelyn.

Without missing a beat, Evelyn clasped Isabelle’s hands, her voice earnest. "Your parents are right here, alive and well. How could you forget them? And if that’s not enough, your sister stands beside you too! They’d never abandon you to face things alone."

Alone? That’s not what I meant at all.

The spectators exchanged glances, their expressions shifting like sand in the wind.

Finally, someone in the crowd scoffed loudly, "Isn’t she just putting on an act?"

Evelyn patted Isabelle’s shoulder comfortingly. "It’s good that you’ve realized you’re not entirely—"

Hah! This pretentious little thing was painfully transparent. Her words were so illogical they practically invited ridicule. Spoiled rotten, no doubt, thinking she could manipulate everyone. But sorry, sweetheart—Evelyn was a master at dismantling fakes.

She sauntered off, fully aware Nathan would smooth things over.

Just as Isabelle’s eyes welled up with staged tears, Nathan stepped forward, his polite but firm gesture cutting the confrontation short. The Cowells swallowed their fury, ushering a bewildered Isabelle inside.

She looked utterly lost—like a deer caught in headlights.

Once the crowd dispersed, Julian finally snapped. "What was that about? Isabelle is innocent! She just misspoke. Did you have to humiliate her like that?"

This woman, who’d stubbornly clung to marrying my brother, is now considering divorce? Wait—did I hear that right?

Nathan’s lips twitched. Clearing his throat, he interrupted Evelyn’s spiraling thoughts. "Leave the guests to me and Julian. You can go inside."

Evelyn beamed. Perfect. Time to enjoy the show.

As she skipped away, Julian pressed trembling fingers to his temples, shooting Nathan a questioning glare.

Nathan didn’t mince words. Seizing the momentary lull, he laid out Evelyn’s… unique situation.

Julian stood frozen for a solid minute before muttering, "Do we need a family therapist? Scratch that—maybe an exorcist."

Nathan shot him a withering look.

Pouting, Julian leaned in. "So… she actually knows everything?"

Nathan responded coolly, "She'll uncover whatever she desires soon enough."

Marcus scoffed. "What, is she the queen of tabloids now?" His tone dripped with skepticism.

Nathan's eyes darkened briefly before shifting the subject. "You're still set on breaking off the engagement tonight?"

Julian hesitated, then nodded. "Yes, but don't worry. I won't disrupt your son's celebration. I've already spoken to the Cowells—they'll stay behind afterward so we can settle this privately."

Nathan gave a curt nod.

"Nobody will object, right?" Julian asked cautiously.

"Are you sure it's Isabelle you want, not Celeste?" Nathan countered.

The memory of Celeste's piercing gaze flashed through Julian's mind, stirring an uncomfortable tightness in his chest. Yet he forced out, "Obviously. Isabelle is fragile—she needs me. Celeste? She’s bitter, jealous, and cruel to her own sister. I can’t stand that kind of woman."

Even as he spoke, the hollowness of his words gnawed at him, especially when Nathan remained expressionless.

Julian pressed on. "You have no idea what Isabelle’s endured because of their identical faces—"

Nathan cut him off. "Your life, your choice. Just don’t regret it later."

Stung, Julian let out a sharp breath before turning away.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the ballroom, his gaze landed on Celeste. Dressed in a sleek black gown, she stood isolated in a corner, swirling her wine glass absently while the crowd buzzed around her.

Then, abruptly, she looked up—directly at him.

Julian jerked his eyes away, his pulse inexplicably racing.

Why? Why did the thought of ending things with her suddenly feel like a mistake?

###Chapter 18 

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, casting dancing shadows across the marble floors. Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her emerald-green mask, the delicate lace brushing against her flushed cheeks. Around her, masked guests in elaborate costumes whispered behind gloved hands, their identities hidden beneath layers of silk and velvet.

Nathan Blackwood stood at the center of the room, his dark suit tailored to perfection, a silver wolf mask obscuring his piercing gaze. He had been watching her all evening—Evelyn could feel it. Every time she turned, his presence lingered like a shadow, both thrilling and unnerving.

Victoria Hayes, dressed in a scandalously low-cut crimson gown, sidled up to him, her ruby lips curved into a smirk. "You’re neglecting your guests, Mr. Blackwood," she purred, fingers trailing along his arm.

Nathan barely spared her a glance. "Some guests require more attention than others." His voice was low, meant only for her ears, but Evelyn caught the tension beneath his words.

Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-watchful agent, nudged her elbow. "Stop staring. You’re here to network, not to moon over him."

Evelyn forced a smile. "I’m not mooning. I’m strategizing."

"Then strategize faster. The press is already speculating about you two."

Before Evelyn could retort, the orchestra struck up a waltz. The crowd parted as Nathan strode toward her, his movements deliberate. He stopped mere inches away, the heat of his body radiating through the thin fabric of her dress.

"May I have this dance, Miss Sinclair?" His voice was velvet, laced with something dangerous.

Evelyn hesitated. Dancing with him was a risk—one that could unravel everything she’d worked for. But the challenge in his eyes was impossible to resist.

She placed her hand in his. "Don’t step on my toes."

Nathan’s lips quirked. "No promises."

As they swept across the floor, the room seemed to fade away. The whispers grew louder, the stares more intense. But Evelyn barely noticed. Not when his grip on her waist tightened, not when his breath ghosted over her ear.

"You’re playing a dangerous game," he murmured.

She met his gaze, unflinching. "So are you."

A slow smirk curled his lips. "Then let’s see who blinks first."

The music swelled, the tension between them thickening like smoke. And then—

A crash echoed through the ballroom.

The crowd gasped as a masked figure stumbled into the center of the dance floor, their costume torn, their breath ragged. The stranger ripped off their mask, revealing a face Evelyn hadn’t seen in years.

Cassandra.

Nathan’s first love.

His grip on Evelyn tightened painfully before he released her abruptly, his expression unreadable.

Cassandra’s voice trembled as she pointed at Evelyn. "She’s the one who ruined everything!"

Silence.

Then chaos.

Evelyn’s pulse roared in her ears as the guests erupted into shocked murmurs. Nathan’s jaw clenched, his gaze flickering between the two women.

Serena grabbed Evelyn’s arm, her grip iron. "We need to leave. Now."

But Evelyn couldn’t move. Not when Cassandra’s accusation hung in the air like a guillotine’s blade.

Nathan took a step forward, his voice cutting through the noise. "Explain."

Cassandra’s lips curled into a bitter smile. "Ask her. Ask Evelyn what she did."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

The game had just changed.

And she had no idea what the next move was.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the lavish penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair tightened her grip on the leather-bound portfolio. Her emerald eyes burned with quiet fury, the documents inside condemning Nathan Blackwood beyond any doubt.

He deserves this.

The thought echoed in her mind like a mantra.

Victoria Hayes had delivered the damning evidence last night—emails, bank transfers, even a recorded confession. All proving Nathan’s betrayal. Evelyn had spent hours poring over them, her heart hardening with each revelation.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Evelyn?" Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant, stepped inside, concern etched on her face. "Nathan’s downstairs. He’s demanding to see you."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Perfect timing."

She strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows, overlooking the city skyline. Below, Nathan stood in the lobby, his usual arrogance replaced by visible agitation. His tailored suit was rumpled, his dark hair disheveled—proof that he hadn’t slept.

Good.

"Let him wait," Evelyn murmured.

Lillian hesitated. "He says it’s urgent. That he can explain—"

"There’s nothing to explain." Evelyn turned, the morning light framing her like a vengeful goddess. "He made his choices. Now he’ll face the consequences."

Her phone buzzed—a message from Preston Whitmore, the director of her upcoming film.

"We need to talk. Urgent."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Nathan’s scandal was already spreading.

Downstairs, Nathan paced the marble lobby, his jaw clenched. The security guards eyed him warily. He’d never been denied access before—never been treated like an outsider in Evelyn’s world.

His phone rang. Julian, his brother.

"Where the hell are you?" Julian’s voice was sharp. "The press is swarming the office. They’re calling it corporate espionage!"

Nathan’s stomach twisted. "I’ll handle it."

"You can’t handle this!" Julian snapped. "Evelyn’s team leaked everything. You’re ."

Nathan’s gaze flicked to the elevator doors, willing Evelyn to appear.

She didn’t.

Upstairs, Evelyn finally descended, her heels clicking like a countdown to his ruin. The elevator doors slid open, and there she stood—radiant, untouchable.

Nathan stepped forward. "Evelyn, please—"

She held up a hand, silencing him. "Save it, Nathan. The world knows the truth now."

His throat tightened. "You don’t understand—"

"I understand perfectly." Her voice was ice. "You used me. Stole from me. And for what? A pathetic power grab?"

The lobby’s glass doors burst open. Reporters surged in, cameras flashing.

Nathan recoiled. "You called them?"

Evelyn smiled. "No. But I didn’t stop them either."

The betrayal in his eyes almost made her falter. Almost.

Then she turned and walked away, leaving him to the wolves.

He deserves it.

And this was only the beginning.

Julian’s mind was a tangled mess. After forcing himself to entertain guests alongside Nathan for a while, he finally slipped away unnoticed.

Nathan barely spared Julian a second thought—he’d only kept him around to discuss matters concerning Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Celeste stood quietly, watching as Edward and Penelope shamelessly boasted about Isabelle to their social circle, acting as if she didn’t exist. By now, their neglect barely registered—she’d grown numb to it.

But something else unsettled her. A heavy, lingering gaze burned into her skin, making her shift uncomfortably.

She glanced around, but the crowd was too dense to pinpoint the source. Uneasy, she retreated to the bathroom for a moment of solitude.

The Blackwood family had arranged luxurious restrooms at the end of the hall, segregated by gender.

Celeste had just reached the ladies’ room when a rough shove from behind sent her stumbling inside.

“Ah!” Her startled cry was muffled by a hand clamping over her mouth.

Before she could react, a man slammed her against the tiled wall.

Her breath hitched as she recognized him—a spoiled heir from some wealthy family. She’d seen him at events before but never exchanged more than passing glances.

Celeste glared, defiance flashing in her eyes.

The man smirked, fingers curling into the delicate fabric of her dress. “Playing hard to get, huh? I don’t care whose fiancée you are. Tonight, you’ll learn what happens when you cross me—”

A sickening tear echoed as her dress ripped.

Her vision blurred with tears. Disbelief and panic choked her. She thrashed, but his grip was iron.

Hot breath ghosted over her neck. A sob tore from her throat.

Then—

BANG!

The door crashed open.

“You’ve got a death wish?”

The weight crushing her vanished. Celeste collapsed to the floor, trembling. When she looked up, Julian stood there, gripping the man’s collar like a vice.

Rage darkened Julian’s face. His fist connected with a brutal crack, sending the man sprawling.

His gaze flicked to Celeste—her torn dress, the exposed skin of her thigh. He turned away instantly, jaw tight.

“Fix yourself.”

After his sharp words, Julian flung his coat toward Celeste and dragged the man out of the bathroom, his grip unyielding.

Rage burned through Julian like wildfire, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles cracked. The fury was overwhelming, but he managed to restrain himself—this wasn’t the place for a scene.

Instead, he hauled the man into the deserted garden, throwing him onto the grass before delivering several brutal kicks.

The man groaned, scrambling to his feet with a sneer. "Julian, have you lost your mind? You’re defending her when you’re already involved with her sister? You don’t even acknowledge her as your fiancée! What, did you come here to catch her cheating?"

Julian’s expression darkened like a storm. "Regardless of who she is to me, I won’t tolerate this kind of disgrace in the Blackwood estate. She clearly wasn’t willing—what the hell were you thinking?"

The man scoffed. "You don’t know a damn thing. That was just foreplay—she loves it rough!"

Julian froze, disbelief flashing across his face.

"What did you just say?"

The man wiped blood from his lip, smirking. "I didn’t make you a cuckold. That little witch seduced me, then tossed me aside after three months. You think I’d just let that slide?"

Something inside Julian snapped. He lunged forward, fingers closing around the man’s throat. "Say that again!"

The man choked out a laugh. "What, jealous? You don’t want her, so no one else can?"

Julian’s vision burned red—he was seconds from breaking the man’s jaw when Nathan suddenly appeared, gripping his arm.

"Enough," Nathan said sharply. "Julian, control yourself."

Nathan pulled the man away, sensing the danger in Julian’s silence. "The guests are waiting. Father’s looking for you."

Julian exhaled harshly, his pulse still roaring in his ears. When he turned, Celeste stood there, clutching his coat, her face ghostly pale.

He moved to walk past her, but she blurted out, "It wasn’t me!"

Julian paused, meeting her defiant gaze.

"It was Isabelle," Celeste insisted, her voice trembling. "She set this up—she wanted you to see—"

"Celeste," Julian growled.

The coldness in his voice made her flinch.

"Enough lies," he said, his tone dripping with disdain. "After everything, you still blame Isabelle?"

A bitter laugh escaped him. "She’s spent years feeling guilty over you, holding back because of our engagement. And for what? You’re not worth it."

Celeste’s breath hitched.

"I’ve only ever loved one woman," Julian said coldly. "The one who saved my life years ago. And that woman is Isabelle. Our engagement is over."

Celeste’s lips parted. "So… you knew. You knew how I felt."

Something twisted in Julian’s chest, but he ignored it. "Consider this a favor. But if you ever hurt Isabelle again—"

Before he could finish, Nathan and Evelyn arrived, frowning at the scene.

"What’s going on?" Nathan demanded. "We agreed to handle this privately."

Julian clenched his jaw. "It’s nothing."

Nathan’s gaze flicked to Celeste’s torn dress, his expression hardening. Evelyn noticed too, her eyes narrowing as she guided Celeste away.

But as she passed Julian, Evelyn muttered under her breath—just loud enough for him to hear:

"He thinks Isabelle saved him. Should I tell him it was actually Celeste? Nah. Let him suffer. He deserves it."

Julian’s blood ran cold.

Nathan caught his arm before he could react. "Enough."

Julian whirled on him. "Did you hear that? She’s lost her mind!"

Nathan studied him, unreadable. "Answer me this: If it was Celeste who saved you, not Isabelle, would your decision change?"

Julian recoiled. "What kind of question is that? Of course not!"

Nathan’s silence was damning.

Julian’s voice rose. "I was there—I know who pulled me out of that fire! The Cowells confirmed it, Isabelle confirmed it—even Celeste never denied it!"

Nathan exhaled. "The truth isn’t always what we remember."

Julian laughed, incredulous. "You’re seriously buying into Evelyn’s delusions?"

But Nathan didn’t answer. And that—more than anything—shook Julian to his core.

Julian's emotions were boiling over, his words tumbling out unchecked. "Are you suggesting Celeste can't handle the truth and is pretending she was the one who rescued me? Does she really believe that would make me choose her? Ha! Not a chance in hell!"

Nathan's voice remained icy. "Don't overcomplicate things. Evelyn knows something we don't. Whether it's a misunderstanding or not, we'll settle it face-to-face later. But ask yourself this—if there was a mix-up, who would you pick?"

"What I love about Isabelle is her purity, her goodness. Even if she hadn't saved me that night, I'd still choose her—without hesitation!"

A shadow crossed Nathan's face. I don't know Celeste well, but Isabelle is no angel. How can Julian be so blind?

Then it hit him. Evelyn had been right all along. Julian did deserve this for his mistake.

###Chapter 19

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone pressed tightly to her ear.

"Lillian, I need you to pull every record on Nathan Blackwood's past investments," she demanded, her voice sharp with urgency.

On the other end, Lillian Graves hesitated. "Evelyn, are you sure about this? If he finds out—"

"I don't care if he finds out," Evelyn snapped, her fingers curling into a fist. "He's hiding something, and I intend to uncover it."

The truth was, Nathan had been acting strangely ever since their last encounter—distant, distracted, his usual sharp wit dulled by something unspoken. It gnawed at her, this sudden shift, and Evelyn had never been one to let mysteries linger.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan stood in his office, staring at the encrypted file on his screen. His jaw tightened as he scanned the contents—documents that could unravel everything.

A knock interrupted his thoughts.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Victoria Hayes, his ever-efficient secretary, stepped in, her heels clicking against the hardwood. "Your sister, Sophia, is on line two. She says it's urgent."

Nathan exhaled sharply. Sophia never called unless it was serious.

He picked up the phone. "What's wrong?"

Her voice was strained. "It's about Daniel. He's been seen with Adriana again."

Nathan's grip on the receiver tightened. His brother-in-law's infidelity was an open secret, but Sophia had always turned a blind eye—until now.

"I'll handle it," he said coldly.

But as he hung up, his gaze flickered back to the file on his screen. The timing couldn't be worse.

Because buried in those documents was a truth that could destroy more than just his sister's marriage.

It could destroy him.

And if Evelyn got her hands on it first?

Nathan's phone buzzed—a message from an unknown number.

"I know what you're hiding."

His blood ran cold.

Someone else was already one step ahead.

When Celeste reappeared after changing her outfit, Evelyn Sinclair hesitated, her lips parting then closing as words failed her.

Having witnessed Celeste's heartbreaking past through the Whisper Network, Evelyn felt an unexpected tightness in her chest.

Orphaned since childhood, Evelyn had believed her own life was a tapestry of hardships. Yet nothing could have prepared her for the revelation that Celeste—despite her wealthy upbringing and living parents—endured a loneliness far deeper than Evelyn's own.

Twins by birth, Isabelle had been born fragile, her health hanging by a thread. Edward and Penelope Cowell had no choice but to whisk her away overseas for specialized treatment, dragging Celeste along like forgotten luggage.

Though physically present, Celeste became a shadow in her own family—overshadowed by the constant medical crises surrounding Isabelle. There were nights she'd been left behind at hotels, mornings when no one remembered her birthday.

Eleanor Cowell, the family matriarch, had intervened upon hearing of the neglect, bringing Celeste home to raise as her own. This separation from her parents at such a tender age left Celeste emotionally adrift, her grandmother becoming her only anchor.

Meanwhile, Isabelle grew up drowning in affection, her every whim indulged. The sudden appearance of a mirror-image sister threatened her universe of privilege.

From the moment the "perfect family" reunited under one roof, Celeste's smile became a rare artifact. Yet her unwavering focus on academic pursuits revealed a quiet resilience that astonished Evelyn.

As they descended the grand staircase together, Evelyn finally voiced the question burning in her throat. "You're really ending things with Julian?"

The Whisper Network had revealed Celeste's secret—she'd carried a torch for Julian Blackwood since age five. Evelyn couldn't fathom what her friend saw in that arrogant aristocrat.

Celeste's nod came swift and decisive, her usual hesitation absent.

Evelyn squeezed her hand. "Good riddance. That man never deserved you. Trust me, your future just got infinitely brighter without that emotional anchor dragging you down."

Celeste's eyes widened—Evelyn had somehow articulated the exact truth she'd been too afraid to admit.

Celeste had not only abandoned Julian but had also lost all faith in her parents and Isabelle. From that moment on, she vowed to seize every chance to sever ties with her family—permanently.

All she desired was a life untouched by Isabelle’s shadow.

“I’m certain I will. Thank you,” Celeste replied with a practiced smile.

As they stepped into the grand ballroom, the Cowell family was just stepping forward to offer their congratulations to Sophia.

The trio seemed to have entirely forgotten they had another daughter.

Edward and Penelope flanked Isabelle, their pride evident as they basked in the spotlight.

“What joyous news that Theodore has been found! May brighter days grace your family, Sophia. Congratulations!”

“Indeed, congratulations! When Julian mentioned this earlier, I was so moved I nearly wept. Truly, a kind soul like yours is blessed by fate. Oh, and Isabelle brought you a gift.”

Edward and Penelope worked tirelessly to keep Isabelle at the center of attention, but after their deceitful claim about being life-savers, the Blackwoods regarded them with thinly veiled discomfort.

“Hmm? Where’s Celeste?” Margaret inquired, her gaze sweeping the room.

Edward and Penelope froze, as if suddenly remembering Celeste’s existence.

“That girl has no manners. Who knows where she’s wandered off to?” Penelope muttered irritably, her disdain clear. To her, Celeste was nothing but an embarrassment.

From across the room, Isabelle watched Julian, noting the stormy expression he’d worn since returning earlier. She knew him well enough to recognize his foul mood.

Celeste must be the cause, she thought smugly. She probably threw herself at him again and got rejected. No wonder she’s hiding now.

Suppressing a smirk, Isabelle feigned concern. “Should I go look for my sister? She must be upset. I’ll bring her back.”

Her dutiful act only highlighted Celeste’s absence, painting her as the unreasonable one.

Then—

A voice cut through the murmurs.

Isabelle stiffened under the sudden scrutiny of the crowd, wishing the floor would swallow her whole.

Celeste approached, her expression unreadable. Isabelle forced a smile. “Oh, you changed your clothes. I thought you were angry with me, Celeste.”

A chill ran down Isabelle’s spine. Did Julian tell her about the proposal? Is that why she looks so furious?

She barely contained her triumphant grin as she shot Celeste a subtle, gloating look.

If this hadn’t been someone else’s event, Celeste would’ve unleashed her fury then and there. She was certain Isabelle had orchestrated the restroom incident, framing her for it.

Clenching her fists, Celeste sat down in silence, ignored by her family as they resumed their socializing.

Across the room, Julian’s distracted gaze snapped to Celeste the moment she appeared.

His face darkened with turmoil.

This can’t be. The person who saved me all those years ago was definitely…

“Tell me,” he muttered under his breath, “what are Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood’s full names?”

Julian turned sharply, his gaze landing on Evelyn who was murmuring something to Nathan.

The moment Nathan responded, an electric tension crackled through the Blackwood family—everyone except Theodore subtly straightened in their seats. Though they continued their polite conversations, their eyes gleamed with barely concealed intrigue, bodies unconsciously tilting toward Evelyn as if drawn by an invisible force.

What the hell is happening?

"I understand now," Evelyn said, her voice carrying just enough to be heard. "I couldn’t fathom how I’d mistaken my rescuer. Turns out, that entire family orchestrated an elaborate deception!"

The Blackwoods had suspected as much, but the pieces still didn’t quite fit. How could Celeste have been oblivious to it all?

Julian’s expression darkened again, his jaw tightening as he shot Evelyn a sidelong glare. He was itching to see how she’d twist this tale—and whether she’d dare implicate him in the process.

###Chapter 20

The penthouse elevator doors slid open with a soft chime, revealing Evelyn Sinclair gripping her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white. The screen displayed the latest tabloid headline: "Nathan Blackwood's Secret Affair with Assistant Confirmed!" accompanied by a grainy photo of him leaving a hotel with Lillian Graves at 2 AM.

"Damn it!" Evelyn hissed, stabbing the elevator button with more force than necessary. Her reflection in the mirrored walls showed smudged mascara - she'd cried all the way from the studio.

The penthouse was eerily silent when she entered. No classical music drifting from the sound system. No scent of Nathan's expensive cologne lingering in the air. Just the faint ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the foyer.

She found him on the terrace, silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline, a tumbler of whiskey in hand.

"You're home early," Nathan remarked without turning around. His voice held that infuriating calmness that always preceded a storm.

Evelyn slammed her phone onto the glass coffee table. "Care to explain this?"

Nathan finally turned, his emerald eyes scanning the headline with mild interest. "Photoshop. Obviously."

"Bullshit!" Evelyn's voice cracked. "Victoria Hayes sent me the security footage. You kissed her in that elevator!"

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw. "That was three months ago. Before we—"

"Before we what? Before you decided to stop sleeping with your entire staff?" Evelyn's laugh was bitter. "God, I'm such an idiot. All those late nights 'working'—"

"Enough." Nathan's glass shattered against the stone railing. "You want the truth? Fine. Lillian was a mistake. One I regretted the moment it happened."

Evelyn recoiled as if struck. The admission hurt more than the lie.

Somewhere in the building, a siren wailed. The city lights blurred through her unshed tears. "I need space," she whispered, grabbing her purse.

Nathan moved faster than she anticipated, blocking the doorway. "Running away won't solve anything."

"I'm not running. I'm surviving." Evelyn shoved past him, but his hand caught her wrist.

"Wait—" His thumb brushed over her racing pulse. "Just... wait."

In that suspended moment, Evelyn saw something raw in his gaze she'd never seen before. Not anger. Not lust. Fear. The great Nathan Blackwood was terrified—of losing her.

Her phone chose that moment to vibrate violently. Preston Whitmore's name flashed on the screen with the subject line: URGENT - Reshoot Schedule.

Nathan's grip loosened. "Go. Your career comes first. It always has."

The words hung between them like a guillotine. Evelyn opened her mouth—to protest? To beg? She'd never know, because her phone buzzed again. This time with a photo attachment that made her blood run cold.

It was Nathan. In their bed. With another woman.

And the timestamp read last night.

"If that's true, this would be the first time Isabelle has taken something that belonged to Celeste."

Julian's expression darkened as he stole a covert glance at Celeste.

Julian and Celeste had been classmates back in their homeland. Fate had twisted their paths when the country they visited for that disastrous summer camp happened to be where Isabelle was receiving treatment.

Even though Julian was only ten at the time, an arrangement between their grandmothers had already bound him as Celeste’s fiancé. Naturally, he was expected to meet the Cowell family.

That was Julian’s first encounter with Isabelle in the hospital ward—where she lay like a fragile porcelain doll, radiating an ethereal, delicate beauty.

"From the moment Isabelle saw Julian, she was spellbound. When she learned he was Celeste’s fiancé—exclusively her sister’s—she threw a tantrum, demanding time with him. Jealousy can poison even the purest heart! Despite being showered with her parents’ undivided love, Isabelle still craved what belonged to Celeste. In her mind, without Celeste, everything would have been hers by default."

Julian’s pulse stuttered at those words.

No. That’s not Isabelle. She isn’t like that.

Back then, Isabelle had caused a scene in the ward. But all Julian felt was pity for the sickly girl who seemed so lonely. And whenever he looked at her face—so eerily similar to Celeste’s—his chest tightened with sympathy.

But Evelyn claimed Isabelle had her parents’ unconditional love. What about Celeste? What did she have back then?

Me. Her fiancé.

The realization struck Julian like a physical blow, leaving his thoughts reeling.

"Originally, Julian and Celeste were supposed to attend the event together. But Isabelle, bedridden in the hospital, threw a fit—demanding she go with Julian instead, barring Celeste from attending. Since the event wasn’t open to last-minute changes, their parents asked Celeste to forfeit her spot. They sent Isabelle in her place, instructing Julian to watch over her."

Julian’s jaw clenched. At the time, he hadn’t questioned it. He’d agreed to Edward and Penelope’s request without considering Celeste’s feelings.

He’d assumed Celeste would yield to her sister. To him, it was natural—expected.

He couldn’t even remember Celeste’s expression that day.

The Blackwood family had praised Celeste for her selflessness, marveling at the sisters’ bond.

(Scene break: The Quirk family’s eavesdropping members exchange uneasy glances. One, hidden behind lush greenery, studies Celeste’s distant figure with dawning unease.)

Meanwhile, Julian’s personal guard—initially unnoticed—suddenly moved. His sharp eyes had caught Julian’s subtle signal.

The valley was treacherous, its depths swallowing all light. Yet Evelyn Sinclair pressed on, her determination unwavering as she searched for Julian Blackwood. When she finally found him unconscious among the scattered belongings, she didn’t hesitate—she hauled him onto her back and carried him out, step by agonizing step.

By the time they reached safety, Evelyn collapsed, her body wracked with fever. The strain of the ordeal had taken its toll. She was rushed to the hospital alongside Julian, leaving the Blackwood family in stunned silence.

But then… how did Isabelle Laurent come into the picture?

When Evelyn’s fever broke, she seemed to have no memory of what had happened. Julian, however, was certain he had seen Isabelle in the valley. The Cowells seized the moment, weaving a web of lies so convincing that even Eleanor, the family matriarch, believed it was Isabelle who had rescued Julian and fallen ill from exhaustion. The camp staff, too, assumed the girl who returned was simply overcome with worry. The deception was seamless.

Yet Julian couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Why would Edward and Penelope Cowell perpetuate this lie? Their relationship with Evelyn hadn’t been strained back then.

"It seems they had always intended to switch their betrothed," Nathan Blackwood murmured, his voice edged with bitterness. "It wasn’t just Isabelle’s fragile health—they saw Evelyn as strong, capable of handling any alliance. Isabelle, on the other hand, needed a family that could provide for her without question."

The Blackwoods finally understood. Few families were as prestigious and wealthy as theirs, and the Cowells had been scheming for years.

When Eleanor Cowell first arranged Evelyn’s engagement to Julian, Edward and Penelope had been furious. They accused her of favoritism, of neglecting Isabelle. Eleanor had fired back, "You only care for Isabelle while ignoring Evelyn. Shouldn’t I ensure her future while I still can?"

Now, with Eleanor gone, the Cowells’ true intentions were laid bare.

But Julian…

His gaze burned with betrayal as he stared at Nathan. Nathan exhaled sharply, unwilling to entertain his brother’s foolishness—but then he remembered something Evelyn had said earlier.

"You were taller than Theodore at ten, weren’t you?" Nathan muttered under his breath.

Julian froze.

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "Not many girls could carry you out of that valley."

Between a healthy Evelyn and a frail Isabelle… who could have possibly managed it?

Julian’s face paled.

Memories flashed through his mind—Evelyn, her hand crushed beneath a cabinet, sweat beading on her forehead as she refused to make a sound. Isabelle, on the other hand, had wept for hours over a twisted ankle.

Evelyn had once refused help moving heavy lab equipment, lifting it effortlessly despite her slender frame. Isabelle had barely lasted three seconds holding a child during a shoot before begging Julian to change the script.

The banquet ended in hushed whispers.

As the Cowells were ushered away to "discuss matters," Julian stood frozen, the truth settling over him like a storm.

The golden chandeliers cast shimmering reflections across the ballroom as Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her emerald-green gown. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood offered a polite but distant smile. "We have prior arrangements with the Blackwood family today," he informed the crowd smoothly, his voice carrying effortless authority. "Time is rather pressing."

Murmurs of disappointment rippled through the gathered guests. Every eye lingered on the striking couple, curiosity burning about how this high-society engagement drama would unfold. Yet none dared protest—when the Blackwoods requested privacy, even the most persistent socialites knew better than to interfere.

Just as the first guests began drifting toward the exits, the grand doors burst open with a dramatic flourish.

"Celeste! My darling Celeste!"

All heads swiveled toward the intrusion. A disheveled Vincent Holloway staggered into the room, his designer suit rumpled and tie askew. The scent of expensive whiskey preceded him as he lurched forward, arms outstretched.

"I heard you're breaking your engagement!" His voice slurred with intoxication yet carried startling conviction. "Then let me propose to your family right now. You belong with me—you've always been mine! I'll take responsibility!"

The ballroom froze.

Celeste Wentworth's porcelain complexion drained of color. Across from her, Julian Blackwood's knuckles whitened around his champagne flute. Their gazes locked on the drunken interloper—the same man who'd accosted Celeste in the ladies' lounge mere hours earlier.

Vincent swayed dangerously, his glassy eyes fixed on Celeste with possessive intensity. "No more games, sweetheart. Time to make an honest woman of you."

A teacup shattered somewhere in the stunned silence.

###Chapter 21
The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the length of her living room, her phone pressed tightly to her ear.

"Serena, I need you to handle this immediately," Evelyn demanded, her voice sharp with urgency.

On the other end, her agent, Serena Whitmore, sighed. "Evelyn, I understand your frustration, but pulling out of the gala last-minute isn’t going to help your image."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "I don’t care about my image right now. Not after what Nathan did."

The memory of last night’s argument with Nathan Blackwood still burned fresh in her mind. His cold dismissal, the way he had turned away as if she were nothing more than an inconvenience.

Serena hesitated. "Look, I get it. But the press is already speculating about tension between you two. If you don’t show up tonight, they’ll assume the worst."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around her phone. "Fine. I’ll go. But I swear, if Nathan so much as looks at me—"

A knock at the door interrupted her.

"Hold on," she muttered, striding toward the entrance.

When she swung the door open, she froze.

Nathan stood there, his dark eyes unreadable, his usual composed demeanor replaced with something far more unsettling—regret.

"Evelyn," he said quietly. "We need to talk."

Her pulse spiked. "You have five minutes."

Behind her, Serena’s voice crackled through the phone. "Evelyn? What’s happening?"

She didn’t answer. Instead, she kept her gaze locked on Nathan, her heart pounding in her chest.

Because despite everything, despite the anger and the hurt, a traitorous part of her still ached for him.

And that was the most dangerous thing of all.

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, but Evelyn Sinclair felt none of its warmth. Her fingers trembled around the stem of her champagne flute as she watched Nathan Blackwood across the room, his tall frame commanding attention even in the sea of elite guests.

Victoria Hayes, ever the viper in silk, leaned too close to him, her crimson lips brushing his ear as she whispered something that made his jaw tighten. Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She had seen the signs for weeks—his late nights, the hushed phone calls, the way he’d grown distant.

Serena Whitmore, her ever-loyal agent, nudged her elbow. "You’re glaring, darling. Breathe."

Evelyn forced a smile, but it felt brittle. "I’m fine."

She wasn’t.

The orchestra swelled into a waltz, and Nathan finally turned, his storm-gray eyes locking onto hers. He excused himself from Victoria and strode toward her, his steps deliberate. Every woman in the room tracked his movement, but Evelyn stood frozen, her pulse a frantic drumbeat.

"May I have this dance?" His voice was low, rough with something she couldn’t name.

She should refuse. But the part of her still in love with him—the foolish, hopeful part—nodded.

His hand settled at her waist, warm and familiar, yet it burned like betrayal. They moved in sync, their bodies remembering what their hearts no longer trusted.

"You’ve been avoiding me," he murmured.

Her laugh was sharp. "Funny. I was about to say the same to you."

His grip tightened. "Evelyn—"

"Don’t." She pulled back just enough to meet his gaze. "I know about Victoria."

A flicker of guilt darkened his expression before he schooled it into cool indifference. "It’s not what you think."

"Really?" Her voice cracked. "Then tell me, Nathan. What is it?"

The music crescendoed, drowning out his reply. But she didn’t need to hear it. The truth was in the way his eyes darted to Victoria, in the way he couldn’t hold her stare.

Evelyn stepped out of his arms, the weight of her engagement ring suddenly unbearable. With a deep breath, she slid it off and pressed it into his palm.

"We’re done."

The gasps around them were a distant hum. Nathan’s face paled. "You don’t mean that."

She turned before he could see her tears. "I’ve never meant anything more."

The crowd parted as she walked away, their whispers chasing her like shadows. But Evelyn didn’t look back.

Some vows weren’t meant to last.

The intruder was none other than Vincent Holloway, the infamous playboy of high society.

With nothing but a moderately handsome face to his name, Vincent was the epitome of a spoiled, worthless heir. His reputation was stained with countless scandals, and he was practically on first-name terms with the local police.

No rumor about him could shock anyone anymore.

But today, the Blackwood family was hosting the event. For Vincent to cause a scene here was nothing short of a deliberate insult.

His aunt and uncle, the Holloways’ representatives, immediately rushed forward to restrain him. "We allowed you to come, but we never permitted you to make trouble!" his aunt Daphne hissed. "Vincent had too much to drink. We’ll take him home immediately."

Vincent, however, shoved them aside. Still fuming from his previous humiliation at Julian’s hands—and Celeste’s public dismissal—he had just received another piece of infuriating news. Downing bottle after bottle of liquor, his rage only grew, until he stormed back into the venue, reckless with intoxication.

He strode straight toward the Cowell family, flashing a smug grin at the stunned Edward and Penelope. "Mr. and Mrs. Cowell," he slurred, "since you're reconsidering marriage arrangements, why not settle mine with Celeste tonight? Everyone’s already here."

His malicious gaze then locked onto Celeste.

For a moment, Celeste’s mind went blank. She didn’t look at Vincent. Instead, her eyes flickered to Isabelle, who was cowering behind her parents.

Isabelle’s face paled, her eyes darting nervously. The moment she noticed Celeste watching her, she flinched and looked away, guilt written all over her.

Just as Vincent reached for Celeste’s wrist, a strong hand intercepted his, gripping it tightly.

Drunk and reckless, Vincent glared at the man stopping him. "Back off, Julian," he sneered. "I don’t even mind taking your leftovers. You should be thanking me!"

"Have you lost your damn mind?" Julian snarled, his fist already flying.

His emotions were already a tangled mess, his frustration boiling over like a caged beast. And now, Vincent had the audacity to provoke him further. Without hesitation, Julian’s punch sent Vincent crashing to the floor.

He was about to strike again when Celeste grabbed his wrist, stopping him. Julian turned, his fury clashing with her icy indifference—as if she didn’t want his interference.

At that moment, her expression was frigid, her gaze locked onto Vincent with unsettling calm.

And in that instant, Julian felt something inside him twist painfully.

Though the Blackwood family was furious with Vincent's behavior, they couldn't simply stand by and watch their own be humiliated.

"What in the world are you doing? Vincent is clearly intoxicated. Resorting to violence—is this how the Holloways treat their guests?" Daphne, Vincent's aunt, snapped, her voice trembling with barely contained rage.

"We, the Holloways, have extended nothing but hospitality, yet you've turned our home into a spectacle. Is this how the Blackwoods conduct themselves as guests?" Margaret countered, her tone icy. "And let's not forget the disgraceful insults."

Daphne's face flushed crimson. "Mrs. Holloway, let's not dance around the issue. You want to call off Celeste's engagement, don't you? Then this matter should be between Vincent and Celeste. It was Julian who interfered. Besides, Vincent merely proposed—he hasn't done anything more!"

Margaret let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "Don't you think Vincent is being rather… presumptuous?"

Daphne faltered. After all, the engagement between the Holloway and Cowell families hadn’t been formally dissolved yet. If scrutinized, Vincent’s reckless proposal could be seen as an outright insult—a slap in the face to the Holloways.

"Now, now, we’re all friends here," Edward interjected smoothly, stepping forward as the mediator. "There’s no need for a little spat between the youngsters to ruin our relationships. Let’s all take a breath. This is entirely my daughter’s fault."

Penelope quickly chimed in, her expression shifting from confusion to a practiced smile. "Celeste should never have entertained Mr. Holloway while still engaged. But perhaps this is fate’s way of setting things right. Why don’t we all sit down and discuss this properly?"

The Cowells were in no position to offend either the Holloways or the Blackwoods.

They had assumed breaking off the engagement would be the end of it. But now, another marriage proposal had landed in their laps—this time from the Blackwoods.

It was an unexpected windfall. And a perfect opportunity to silence those who accused Edward and Penelope of favoring Isabelle over Celeste.

The lingering guests, who had been reluctant to leave, were now thoroughly invested in the drama of two sisters entangled with two powerful men.

But then, the situation took an even more unexpected turn.

"Seems fortune has smiled upon your family today," one guest remarked with a knowing smirk. "Since we’re all here, let’s have the three families bear witness. Don’t forget to send us invitations for the celebration!"

"Indeed," another added. "Everyone’s found their perfect match. Though you youngsters do love stirring up trouble—still, this is a blessing in disguise."

Celeste and Vincent, both notorious for their scandals, were now paired together. Meanwhile, Isabelle and Julian—both paragons of grace—made a flawless couple.

Everything had fallen into place.

And the guests? They were merely there to revel in the spectacle.

If this triple alliance succeeded, business strategies across the elite circles would need some… adjustments.

But beneath the surface, tensions simmered.

Because in high society, nothing was ever as simple as it seemed.

Having insider knowledge proved invaluable.

Nathan observed everything from the sidelines while Evelyn beside him was practically vibrating with excitement. Holy hell! This is scandalous gold!

Her outburst momentarily diverted the Blackwood family's attention. Still, they had to focus on Julian's life-altering situation.

Richard and Margaret exchanged glances before continuing the discussion. Protective as they were, they had no intention of creating an impasse.

The tension in the room had escalated, drawing every guest's rapt attention. It was crucial to resolve this immediately before rumors spiraled out of control.

Richard cleared his throat. "Since the truth is out, we won't conceal it any longer. The engagement was an old-family promise. But modern youth value autonomy in love. The Blackwoods won't force our son's hand."

Margaret added pointedly, "We only hope young people make choices they won't regret."

Their gazes lingered on Julian meaningfully.

After discovering the Cowells' deception, their disdain for Isabelle, Edward, and Penelope burned fiercely. Claiming credit for another's sacrifice? Disgusting.

Yet matters of the heart were personal. Julian knew the truth now. Whether he believed it was his choice. But how did Celeste get entangled with Vincent? A shame. No matter.

They left Julian to his thoughts, ears straining toward Evelyn's ongoing commentary.

Gasp! No way! You're kidding! Damn! This can't be real!

The Blackwoods mentally groaned. Stop teasing and just tell us already!

But Julian remained oblivious to Evelyn's theatrics, his mind in turmoil.

Edward and Penelope, however, swooped in cheerfully. "How progressive of the Blackwoods! Julian, darling, don't you agree?"

They shoved Isabelle forward, blind to her mortified expression.

Julian's lips parted, the burning question on his tongue—Who really saved me that night? But did it even matter now?

Gratitude isn't love. Maybe she lied because she loved me too much. Then why can't I speak?

His hesitation cast a pall over the room. Whispers erupted. A twist! How delicious!

Isabelle, unable to bear the silence, tugged Julian's sleeve desperately. "Julian..."

He blinked at her—the woman he'd adored for years—then at Celeste, so familiar yet suddenly a stranger.

Meanwhile, the Blackwoods, too engrossed in eavesdropping, missed Julian's inner turmoil.

His breath hitched as he noticed Celeste's retreating figure. Is she... leaving me?

An inexplicable ache bloomed in his chest—one he didn't understand.

"Celeste, don't be difficult," Edward snapped. "We'll handle the Holloways. Greed doesn't become you."

Penelope added coldly, "We know you resent Isabelle, but this is her happiness. The Blackwoods have spoken. Julian refuses to marry you. Must you humiliate yourself further?"

Their cruelty rolled off Celeste like rain off stone. Their words couldn't hurt her anymore.

"Today," she announced, voice steady, "I formally end our engagement." A weight lifted as she smiled. "Julian, I don't want you anymore."

The words struck like a physical blow. Julian swayed, a piece of his soul tearing away.

Julian stood frozen in place.

This was supposed to be the moment he had been waiting for—the end of his torment. Yet instead of relief, he felt trapped in a nightmare.

While the guests exchanged surprised glances, none dwelled on it too deeply. They assumed Celeste must have truly been involved with Vincent, which explained her decisive breakup.

Edward, Penelope, and Isabelle exhaled in relief.

Evelyn smirked inwardly. The Cowells are all hypocrites. They know exactly where Celeste’s heart lies, yet they pretend ignorance. They pressured her endlessly at Eleanor’s place, but she always refused. She let Isabelle take everything from her—except Julian. And now, she’s given him up too. She’s truly let go.

Julian is such a fool. He lost a diamond while chasing pebbles. He’ll regret this.

When the Blackwoods caught Evelyn’s thoughts, they stiffened. So Celeste still has feelings for Julian?

Julian’s lips trembled. That’s right. She loved me. But now, she’s moved on. Of course she has—she’s with someone else.

Yet the memory of Celeste’s shattered expression when she denied her involvement flashed through his mind.

A hand clapped his shoulder, snapping him back to reality.

Julian blinked, realizing the Cowells were staring at him expectantly—waiting for him to announce his engagement to Isabelle.

But he remained silent. Something felt wrong. A deep, gnawing regret twisted inside him.

Vincent, however, couldn’t hide his smug satisfaction. He sauntered toward Celeste, grinning. "Finally came to your senses, huh? From now on, you’re my fiancée."

Julian’s fingers curled into fists, his gaze snapping toward Celeste.

But she didn’t even glance his way. Instead, she fixed Vincent with an icy stare, lips curling in disdain. "Who the hell are you? Do I know you? Open your eyes—I, Celeste, have never met you in private. You’ve been spreading lies about us, and I will sue you for defamation."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Oh, this just got interesting.

The Blackwoods, initially confused, quickly pieced together Evelyn’s thoughts. Celeste is telling the truth. Wait—so Vincent fabricated everything?

Julian’s mind reeled. The scene in the garden replayed in his head.


The moment Julian saw the devastation in Celeste's eyes, his world tilted on its axis.

Her gaze held a depth of anguish so profound it stole his breath away. The engagement ring in his palm suddenly felt like a lead weight, its diamond catching the light with cruel irony. Sweat slicked his fingers as his grip tightened unconsciously.

A choked whisper escaped Celeste's lips. "You can't mean this."

Julian's throat worked, but no words came. The gilded walls of the Blackwood estate seemed to press in around them, the grandfather clock's ticking an ominous countdown to ruin.

Across the room, Isabelle stood frozen near the grand piano, her twin's distress mirrored in her own features. The scent of wilting gardenias from the centerpiece hung heavy between them.

"You promised," Celeste breathed, her voice fracturing like thin ice. The lace of her Valentino dress trembled with each shallow breath.

Somewhere downstairs, a door slammed. The sound jolted Julian into motion. He reached for her, but Celeste recoiled as if burned.

The movement sent his world crashing down.

###Chapter 22

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. The call from Preston Whitmore had come in just minutes ago, and her pulse still hadn’t settled.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. It’s urgent."

Those words alone were enough to send a chill down her spine. Preston never called unless it was serious.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered by the doorway, concern etched across her features. "Everything alright?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I don’t know yet."

Before she could elaborate, the elevator doors slid open, and Nathan Blackwood strode in, his tailored suit immaculate as always, though his expression was unreadable. His presence alone was enough to make the air in the room shift—charged, tense.

"You heard," Evelyn said flatly.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Preston called me too."

Lillian glanced between them, sensing the brewing storm. "Should I… leave?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Stay. Whatever this is, we’ll handle it together."

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "It’s about the project. There’s been a leak."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What kind of leak?"

"Someone got their hands on the script revisions. The press is already spinning it as 'creative differences' between you and Donovan Sharpe."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "That’s impossible. Only a handful of people had access—"

"Exactly." Nathan’s voice was low, dangerous. "Which means someone close to us betrayed us."

A heavy silence settled over the room. Evelyn’s mind raced through the possibilities—Victoria Hayes, her ever-scheming secretary? Or perhaps Marcus Donovan, Christopher’s agent, who had been unusually interested in the project’s details lately?

Lillian cleared her throat. "What do we do now?"

Nathan’s lips curled into a cold smile. "We find out who did this. And then we make sure they regret it."

Evelyn met his gaze, a spark of determination igniting in her chest. Whoever had crossed them had no idea what they’d just unleashed.

And she was going to make sure they paid.

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the glittering ballroom, she knew something was off. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her skin prickle. She adjusted the strap of her emerald-green gown, her gaze sweeping across the crowded room.

Nathan Blackwood stood near the grand staircase, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored tuxedo. His usual confident demeanor was replaced by something darker—something she couldn’t quite place.

Then she saw her.

Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, stood too close to him, her crimson lips curved into a smirk as she whispered something in his ear. Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Not again.

She forced herself to take a deep breath. This wasn’t the first time Victoria had tried to stake a claim on Nathan, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. But tonight felt different.

Before she could approach them, a familiar voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

"Evelyn, darling!" Serena Whitmore, her ever-dramatic agent, appeared beside her, clutching a champagne flute. "You look absolutely divine."

Evelyn barely managed a tight smile. "Thanks, Serena. What’s going on over there?" She nodded toward Nathan and Victoria.

Serena’s eyes gleamed with mischief. "Oh, you haven’t heard? Rumor has it Victoria’s been very cozy with Nathan lately. Some even say she’s the reason he canceled your last dinner date."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She had suspected as much, but hearing it out loud was another thing entirely.

Just then, Nathan’s gaze locked onto hers from across the room. His expression was unreadable, but the way Victoria’s hand lingered on his arm sent a clear message.

You’re not the only one in his life.

Evelyn turned away before he could see the hurt in her eyes. She wouldn’t give Victoria the satisfaction.

But as she reached for a glass of wine, a new figure stepped into her path—Vincent Holloway, the notorious playboy, his smirk as dangerous as ever.

"Evelyn," he purred, his voice dripping with false charm. "Fancy seeing you here alone."

She arched a brow. "I’m not alone, Vincent. I’m just choosing my company carefully."

His grin widened. "Then let me make this easy for you." He extended a hand. "Dance with me."

Evelyn hesitated. Glancing back at Nathan, she saw his jaw tighten as he watched them.

Good.

Maybe it was time he realized he wasn’t the only one with options.

With a slow, deliberate smile, she placed her hand in Vincent’s.

"Lead the way."

“Are they fighting?”

“But judging by Celeste’s expression, I don’t think she’s lying.”

“Even if Vincent is despicable, he’s still the heir of the Holloway family. Why would he make up such a ridiculous story?”

“Celeste already threatened legal action. How could there be any doubt?”

The murmurs in the crowd grew louder, the situation becoming more baffling by the second.

Vincent hadn’t expected Celeste to outright deny everything. His face twisted in fury. “How dare you lie to my face! No wonder you were so terrified of the Blackwoods finding out about us. You hid our relationship because you were ashamed, didn’t you? You never wanted anyone to know. Well, guess what? I won’t let you erase me that easily! Celeste, you should be grateful I’m even giving you a chance to save face. If I expose everything, you’ll have nothing left!”

Celeste didn’t flinch. Instead, she laughed, her voice dripping with disdain. “Go ahead. Say whatever you want. Let’s see who ends up humiliated.”

Her sharp gaze flicked toward Isabelle. Just as expected, her twin sister’s face paled.

“You—!” Vincent snarled.

Before the argument could escalate, Edward stepped in, gripping Celeste’s arm. His voice was low but urgent. “What’s gotten into you? Stop this nonsense. You might not care about your reputation, but the Cowells do!”

Penelope hurried forward, taking Celeste’s hand with a forced smile. “You’re ruining a perfectly good occasion. Who would ever want you if you keep acting like this? Apologize to Vincent now.”

She then turned to Daphne and her husband, her tone sickeningly sweet. “Our daughter has a bit of a temper, but she’ll grow out of it once she’s married. Please be patient with her.”

Daphne and her husband exchanged glances. Neither of them had any respect for Celeste, but Vincent’s reputation was even worse. At least they were equally matched in scandal.

“Celeste is… spirited,” Daphne said carefully. “But that’s fine. Marriage will smooth out her rough edges.”

Before the hollow pleasantries could continue, Celeste scoffed loudly.

“What, are we ignoring personal consent now? Is this the Dark Ages?” She yanked her hands free from her parents’ grasp as if breaking chains.

The room fell silent.

Celeste’s eyes burned with defiance. “If you think I’ll let you force me into this farce, you’re delusional.”

Vincent’s smirk faltered.

She wasn’t backing down.

And that changed everything.

The crowd gasped as Celeste's sharp words cut through the air like a blade.

"Well done! If you're going to act like fools, then don't pretend to understand human decency. How dare you dictate terms to me?"

The Blackwood family exchanged uneasy glances, silently agreeing that Edward and Penelope were being utterly unreasonable. Celeste had made her stance clear—she wanted nothing to do with Vincent. Yet, her parents persisted, shamelessly pushing her toward a man she despised.

The Cowell family, however, remained oblivious. Edward finally snapped, his face red with fury. "How dare you speak to us like that? You’ve grown increasingly disrespectful! Is this how you address your parents?"

Penelope’s voice trembled with feigned hurt. "You’re being irrational and ungrateful! We’re only thinking of your future. After everything Vincent has done for you, how can you refuse him? Sit down and settle this like an adult!"

Celeste let out a bitter laugh. "I am an adult. You don’t get to make my decisions anymore."

Her tone was icy, a stark contrast to her usual composed demeanor. Normally, she would humor their demands—but not this time. The Celeste standing before them now was defiant, unyielding, and it left Edward and Penelope stunned into silence.

"Have you lost your mind? We’re your parents!" Edward spluttered.

Celeste’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "Funny. I was starting to think you were Isabelle’s parents, not mine."

The barb struck deep. Penelope recoiled as if slapped, while Edward’s face darkened with rage.

"Shut your mouth!"

"What nonsense are you spewing, you rebellious brat?"

Celeste didn’t flinch. "Oh? Did I hit a nerve? I’m starting to wonder if you knew all along what Isabelle did—and still chose to trap me in this farce. Disgusting."

Even the Blackwoods shifted uncomfortably, sensing the truth in her words. But Celeste was done playing the obedient daughter.

"I’ve made myself clear. I don’t know this man. Yet you’d rather trust a stranger than your own daughter. Tell me—are you trying to ruin my life?"

Nathan’s presence alone commanded silence. The moment he spoke, doubt crept into the room.

Vincent, however, wasn’t about to back down. Seeing Celeste’s defiance, he smirked and snapped his fingers. "You brought this on yourself."

The screen behind them flickered to life—revealing a series of scandalous, uncensored photos.

Gasps erupted.

There, in full view, was proof of Vincent and Celeste’s past intimacy.

"Pathetic," Vincent sneered. "I’ve had you in every way possible, and you still deny it?"

But instead of crumbling, Celeste burst into laughter.

Julian’s gaze locked onto the images, his face paling with fury. Because he knew—that wasn’t Celeste.

The expression, the posture… none of it matched. If not her, then who?

His stomach twisted before he could finish the thought.

And then, Isabelle’s voice echoed in his mind, sealing the truth with brutal finality.

There would be no rebuttal. No defense.

Only betrayal.

What a shocking revelation! Isabelle's wild side in private is something I never saw coming. How could I have ever doubted her acting skills? My deepest apologies for that. Watching how flawlessly she portrayed the innocent angel without a hint of her true mischievous nature—she absolutely deserves her status as a top-tier actress. Isabelle is nothing short of extraordinary.

When Julian was buried in filming and unavailable, she refused to sit around waiting. Instead, she sought company elsewhere, expertly finding someone equally interested in a no-strings-attached fling. She assumed they could enjoy a brief, passionate affair before parting ways, each keeping their little secret. But fate had other plans—she never expected to get tangled up with a notorious rogue.

Look at her now. Her face has gone ghostly pale. And judging by her parents' expressions, they’re completely blindsided. Oh dear. I wonder if Vincent will drop an even bigger bombshell later. If he does, the scandal will be impossible to ignore.

Evelyn smirked, thoroughly enjoying the unfolding drama. The Blackwood family members exchanged bewildered glances, their minds racing. What else could possibly come to light?

Julian, meanwhile, felt his world shattering around him. He’d isolated himself for over three months without contacting Isabelle. If this was truly Isabelle’s doing, then she must have impersonated Celeste for her escapades, letting her sister take the fall. How low could someone sink to do something so despicable?

At that moment, Julian’s mind reeled. Had he been living a lie this entire time?

"These are all fake," Celeste declared, her laughter fading into cold defiance.

"Fake? You’re not seriously suggesting these photos are doctored, are you, Celeste? You’re really—"

"The pictures are real," Celeste cut in sharply, her gaze locking onto Isabelle. "But the face isn’t mine alone. Next time, Vincent, you’d better be absolutely certain who you’re sleeping with. Just because someone claims to be a certain person doesn’t mean they actually are!"

Vincent stood frozen, his mouth slightly agape.

A heavy silence fell over the room.

Celeste’s words implied the unthinkable—that Isabelle, the Cowell family’s cherished, seemingly innocent darling, was the woman in those scandalous photos.

Even Vincent, who had seen it all, hesitated for a split second.

Meanwhile, Edward and Penelope were on the verge of losing their minds.

###Chapter 23

The golden afternoon light streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting long shadows across the marble floors. She stood frozen in the doorway, her manicured fingers tightening around the designer handbag as her emerald eyes locked onto the scene before her.

Nathan Blackwood sat casually on her cream-colored sofa, his muscular frame dwarfing the delicate furniture. The scent of his expensive cologne mixed dangerously with the faint aroma of her jasmine candles. His storm-gray eyes held an intensity that made her pulse quicken against her will.

"You're late," he remarked, swirling the amber liquid in his crystal glass. The ice cubes clinked like tiny warning bells.

Evelyn's assistant Lillian Graves hovered nervously behind her. "Mr. Blackwood insisted on waiting inside. I tried to—"

"It's fine, Lillian," Evelyn interrupted, stepping forward with forced composure. The click of her stilettos echoed through the tense silence. "What do you want, Nathan? I have a photoshoot in two hours."

Nathan set down his drink with deliberate slowness. "We need to talk about what happened in Monte Carlo."

Her breath hitched. That weekend had been a mistake—too much champagne, the moonlight on the Mediterranean, the way his hands had felt tracing the scar along her ribcage...

"I remember signing an NDA," she said coolly, perching on the armchair opposite him. "Unless you're here to renegotiate terms?"

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "Always the businesswoman. But this isn't about contracts, Evelyn." He leaned forward, elbows on knees. "It's about why you ran."

The air between them crackled with unspoken words. Outside, Manhattan buzzed indifferently—honking cabs, shouting pedestrians, the relentless heartbeat of the city that never noticed personal dramas.

Evelyn's phone buzzed insistently in her pocket. Probably Preston Whitmore, wondering where his lead actress was for the Vanity Fair spread. She ignored it.

"I didn't run," she lied smoothly. "The shoot in Paris was moved up. You know how Donovan Sharpe is about schedules."

Nathan's gaze dropped to her left hand, where her thumb was unconsciously rubbing the spot where her Cartier watch usually sat—a tell she'd had since drama school. His eyes darkened with recognition.

"Liar," he murmured, almost fondly. Then louder: "You're afraid."

Evelyn shot to her feet. "Of what? You?" Her laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Please. I've dealt with worse than a Blackwood heir with daddy issues."

The insult hung between them like a grenade with the pin pulled. Nathan's expression didn't change, but she saw the muscle jump in his jaw.

Then, with calculated calm, he stood and closed the distance between them in three strides. Evelyn refused to retreat, even when his heat surrounded her, even when his breath ghosted over her lips as he whispered:

"Then why won't you look me in the eye when you say that?"

Her traitorous gaze flicked up—and instantly regretted it. The raw hunger in his eyes stole the breath from her lungs. The Monte Carlo memories came flooding back: tangled sheets, whispered promises, the way he'd said her name like a prayer...

The intercom buzzed, shattering the moment. "Ms. Sinclair? Your car is here."

Nathan stepped back, his mask of indifference sliding back into place. "Duty calls."

Evelyn smoothed her dress with trembling hands. "This conversation isn't over."

"Oh, it's just beginning," he promised, retrieving his suit jacket from the back of the sofa. At the door, he paused. "By the way, I bought the film rights to 'Midnight Whispers.' Thought you'd want to know before the trades announce it tomorrow."

Her blood ran cold. That book—her mother's story, the scandal that had destroyed their family. "You wouldn't dare."

Nathan's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Watch me."

As the door clicked shut behind him, Evelyn's knees finally gave out. She collapsed onto the sofa, Nathan's un whiskey staring accusingly at her from the coffee table.

Lillian rushed forward. "Should I cancel the shoot? You look—"

"Like hell, I know." Evelyn drained the glass in one burning swallow. "No cancellations. And Lillian?" She met her assistant's worried gaze. "Find out everything about this 'Midnight Whispers' deal. Now."

Because Nathan Blackwood had just declared war—and Evelyn Sinclair never lost a fight.

The weight of the world pressed down on Evelyn Sinclair's shoulders as she stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of Nathan Blackwood's penthouse. Her fingers trembled around the edge of the divorce papers she had just signed, the ink still fresh, the finality of it all carving a hollow ache in her chest.

She had fought so hard. Loved so fiercely.

And yet, here she was—alone.

The sound of heels clicking against marble snapped her attention toward the foyer. Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s ever-efficient secretary, stepped into view, her crimson lips curled in a smirk that made Evelyn’s stomach twist.

"Still here, Evelyn?" Victoria purred, her manicured fingers tapping against her tablet. "Nathan’s already left for the gala. I’d hate for you to embarrass yourself by lingering where you’re no longer wanted."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms, but she refused to rise to the bait. Not again. Not when every ounce of her energy was spent just keeping herself upright.

"I’m leaving," she said, her voice steadier than she felt.

But as she turned toward the elevator, a sharp pain lanced through her abdomen, so sudden and intense that she gasped, her knees buckling. She barely registered the cold floor against her skin before darkness swallowed her whole.

Nathan Blackwood had spent the last hour drowning in whiskey, the burn in his throat doing nothing to dull the gnawing guilt in his gut. The gala was in full swing around him—champagne flutes clinking, laughter ringing—but all he could see was Evelyn’s shattered expression when he’d walked away from her that morning.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Marcus Donovan, his brother Julian’s agent, appeared at his side, frowning. "You look like hell."

Nathan didn’t answer. His phone buzzed—once, twice—before he finally glanced at the screen.

Unknown Number: You might want to get to the hospital. Evelyn collapsed. She’s pregnant.

The glass slipped from his fingers, shattering against the floor.

And just like that, the world tilted on its axis.

"You insolent brat! How dare you speak like that? Have you lost your mind?" Edward roared, his face turning crimson with rage. He lunged forward, hand raised to strike Celeste.

But Celeste moved with feline grace, sidestepping just in time. The momentum sent Edward staggering forward, nearly toppling over.

When he finally regained his balance, his finger trembled as he pointed at her. "She's your sister! How could you accuse Isabelle of such things?" Penelope shrieked, clutching Isabelle protectively as if Celeste were some wild animal about to pounce.

Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. The favoritism was so blatant it was almost comical. When those scandalous photos first surfaced, Edward and Penelope had looked at Celeste with nothing but contempt, silently blaming her for bringing shame upon the family. But now that the truth was out—that it was Isabelle in those compromising positions—their reaction? Well, that was parental love for you. If not for their identical faces, one might seriously question if Celeste was even their biological daughter.

Evelyn's inner monologue made the Quirks exchange knowing glances. The disparity in how Edward and Penelope treated their daughters was staggering—one coddled like a precious gem, the other discarded like trash. What kind of parents behaved this way?

Celeste had long grown numb to their theatrics. She simply watched, her expression unreadable, as her parents spiraled into hysterics.

Look at her. She's used to this. It was clear this wasn’t the first time Edward and Penelope had acted so irrationally, as if they’d reserved all their brain cells exclusively for Isabelle’s benefit. Pathetic. The favored child never suffers—it’s always the overlooked one who gets hurt.

Nathan found himself lost in thought, memories resurfacing.

Time and time again, the same scene played out.

Celeste, standing rigidly to the side, her face an icy mask. Isabelle, tears streaming down her cheeks, playing the victim to perfection. Edward and Penelope shielding Isabelle while hurling accusations at Celeste—cruel, heartless, wicked.

Not once had they ever taken Celeste’s side.

How could someone who was constantly favored ever learn to compromise?

But in the past, Nathan had simply assumed Celeste resented Isabelle out of jealousy. Now, he wasn’t so sure. Everything he thought he knew suddenly felt like a lie.

Celeste’s gaze locked onto Isabelle, her voice sharp as a blade. "Isabelle, who exactly did you say that person was?"


Isabelle shrank back, trembling like a frightened doe as she buried herself deeper into Penelope’s embrace. Despite her fragile act, her voice was steady. "Celeste, what are you even talking about?"

"Just as I thought," Celeste said with a bitter laugh. "You’re beyond redemption."

Edward and Penelope looked ready to combust. Their precious daughter being spoken to like this? Unthinkable! They gasped for air between furious curses, lamenting Celeste’s defiance.

Vincent stormed forward, his expression thunderous. "Celeste," he spat, "you really don’t know when to quit, do you? Fine. Let’s see how you weasel your way out of this."

With a cold smirk, he tapped his phone once more.

The intimate photo on the screen dissolved, replaced by a series of hospital records. Image after image flashed by until finally, an abortion consent form filled the screen.

Name: Isabelle Cowell

"You carried my child," Vincent hissed, "and then you killed it behind my back. You owe me, Celeste. And I won’t let you escape this time."

Celeste’s eyes widened in shock, her gaze snapping toward Isabelle.

Isabelle was shaking violently, her face pale with fear—but only for a second. Just as quickly, she schooled her features back into that practiced innocence.

Julian’s face had gone deathly pale. His entire world tilted on its axis as he stared at that damning document.

Finally. The truth was out.

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

The Quirks finally understood—this was the scandal Evelyn had hinted at. And it was devastating. Now, it was just a matter of who had the guts to verify it.

The murmurs in the room grew louder, drowning out Isabelle’s brief moment of panic.

"Oh, I remember her now," someone whispered. "She was a senior at my college. There were always rumors about her... complicated love life. There was even a photo circulating of her at a clinic."

The crowd erupted.

"So it’s true then? And she still won’t admit it?"

"Honestly, what’s so bad about marrying Vincent? They were practically having a child together!"


"Didn't you claim she slept around? There could be multiple men involved!"

Vincent Holloway smirked victoriously, reaching out to grab Celeste's wrist.

Celeste stepped back, turning to face the man who called himself her junior. "You should know," she said coolly, "if those posts were spreading lies, our university forum would’ve deleted them. Why didn’t you mention that? Those posts vanished long ago—and the people who posted them were silenced."

Vincent choked on his words, shame forcing his gaze downward.

Pathetic. Evelyn Sinclair’s thoughts dripped with disdain. He pursued you, got rejected, and now he’s trying to ruin you. Probably the one fueling those rumors too. What a joke.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances, mentally noting which family this disgrace belonged to. Someone like him should be blacklisted.

Julian Blackwood’s sharp eyes locked onto Vincent’s face, memorizing every detail. A dangerous glint flashed in his gaze.

Vincent shivered, suddenly feeling like prey.

Celeste had no patience left. "I’ll say it again. Prove it was me. With an identical twin, impersonation isn’t exactly hard, is it?"

"You’re still denying it?" Vincent laughed bitterly, frustration boiling over.

"You got pregnant, committed that vile act, and framed your own sister?" Edward Cowell’s voice trembled with rage.

"Disgraceful!" Penelope Cowell clutched her chest. "How did I raise such a shameless daughter? Celeste, if you keep this up, we’ll disown you!"

As if that threat would reel her in.

Celeste scoffed. "I stopped wanting to be your daughter years ago."

The words froze Edward and Penelope mid-breath.

"...What did you just say?"

Bitterness seeped into Celeste’s voice. "What’s so great about being your daughter? You couldn’t even recognize me in a photo. Why act shocked? Haven’t you ever questioned it? Others might not know, but she’s spent her whole life stealing my name. One more lie shouldn’t surprise you."

The Cowells stiffened, as if her words had yanked buried memories to the surface. Their expressions twisted uncomfortably.

Panicked, they scrambled to divert the conversation.

Typical. Evelyn’s mental eye-roll was almost audible. They’re terrified she’ll expose the truth.

Every time the topic arose, the Cowells had never denied Isabelle’s false claims.

Celeste’s laugh was hollow. "Remember when you told me not to correct the media? ‘It’s filial piety,’ you said. ‘Chasing fame brings chaos.’" Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Was that really your belief? Or did you just want my hard work to polish her reputation? You couldn’t bear her suffering—but you had no problem sacrificing me for her ‘good name.’"

Edward flushed crimson. "Nonsense! It was for your grandmother! If Isabelle were healthier, she would’ve done it! You only stepped in because you were stronger!"

Holy hell. Evelyn’s nails dug into her palm. That’s the most twisted logic I’ve ever heard.

The Blackwoods and onlookers exchanged stunned glances. For the first time, the Cowells’ blatant favoritism was laid bare—and the crowd’s sympathy shifted toward Evelyn’s perspective.

"Ridiculous," Celeste whispered. "I did the work. I didn’t need praise. But I damn well deserved credit—not to have it stolen."

Yet Edward and Penelope remained stubborn, convinced that Celeste was simply being difficult.

Celeste pressed on, her voice steady. "So you admit Isabelle took my identity that day?"

The room fell silent as everyone snapped back to reality. Could this really be considered an old transgression?

Edward and Penelope quickly defended, "Isabelle never meant to do that! It was just an accident—"

"Then what about the hit-and-run?" Celeste cut in sharply. "She struck a child, leaving him permanently injured. Even when the family agreed to settle, she was terrified it would ruin her reputation before her big break. So during the investigation, she pretended to be me. Used my name." Her voice grew colder. "Afterward, she played the devastated victim, making me feel sorry for her—convincing me she only lied out of fear. But now I see it was all an act. And none of you spoke up. You just told me to keep quiet, promised you'd handle the child's situation. But in the end, you all forgot. Even Isabelle forgot."

A ripple of shock spread through the crowd. This had been one of the scandals that tarnished Celeste's name. Had she really been the scapegoat all along?

Julian's face darkened instantly.

That incident had been the moment he'd publicly condemned Celeste. The accident itself might have been unintentional, but abandoning the victim afterward? That spoke of character.

It was the turning point—when he'd started despising her.

Back then, he remembered Celeste looking like she wanted to say something, but Isabelle had pulled him away. The last thing he'd seen was the glimmer of unshed tears in Celeste's eyes.

Now, his jaw clenched. Had that... also been a lie?

"No—Celeste, why would you—?" Isabelle finally broke, sobbing uncontrollably.

Seeing her distress, Edward and Penelope immediately turned on Celeste, desperate to silence her.

But Celeste didn't flinch. "Do I need to show proof? That day, I was at an academic conference."

The couple froze, stunned by Celeste's defiance.

Isabelle hadn't expected this. Celeste had always backed down before, no matter how much she was pushed. Because for Celeste, their parents' approval and her sister's dependence had meant everything.

But now? It was like she'd cut all ties. Was she really willing to burn everything down just to expose the truth?

Before Isabelle could panic further, Celeste exhaled deeply—as if shedding the last of the chains that had bound her for years.

The air thickened with tension.

This wasn't just a revelation.

It was war.

The grand ballroom fell into stunned silence as Celeste's voice cut through the tension like a knife. "I was the one who organized the Cowell Foundation's relief efforts after the hurricane," she declared, her emerald eyes blazing. "Yet every donation receipt bore your name, Isabelle."

A gasp rippled through the crowd as she continued, her words precise as surgical incisions. "That scholarship you supposedly won at Juilliard? The audition you faked an injury to avoid? That was my performance they heard—my hands that played Chopin's Ballade No.1 when yours were trembling."

Isabelle's porcelain cheeks glistened with crocodile tears, but Celeste wasn't . "When you crashed the Maserati after that gala, who do you think the board blamed? The forged contracts with Blackwood Enterprises—signed in my handwriting but never by my hand." She gestured to the family portrait above the mantel, where their grandfather's stern gaze seemed to judge them all. "They revoked my inheritance rights over losses I didn't cause."

The revelation hit like thunder. Several society matrons clutched their pearls, remembering the scandalous rumors about Celeste's "erratic behavior" at Yale—now clearly Isabelle's handiwork.

"You've stolen my achievements and saddled me with your disasters." Celeste's voice cracked as she ripped the diamond pendant from her neck—their grandmother's matching heirloom, now tarnished by deceit. "I won't play the villain in your story anymore."

Isabelle reached out with trembling fingers. "Sister, please—"

"No." Celeste stepped back, the broken chain pooling at her feet like liquid silver. "The curtain's falling on your performance, Isabelle. This is one standing ovation you'll take alone."

###Chapter 24
The grand ballroom shimmered under crystal chandeliers as Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her Venetian mask. Across the crowded masquerade, Nathan Blackwood stood like a dark sentinel, his emerald eyes tracking her every move through the slits of his black domino mask.

"Stop fidgeting," Lillian Graves whispered, adjusting the sapphire pins in Evelyn's upswept hair. "You look exquisite. Like moonlight given form."

Evelyn's fingers trembled against her champagne flute. "He's watching me again."

"Of course he is," Serena Whitmore materialized at her elbow, her ruby mask catching the light. "You're the only woman here not throwing yourself at the Blackwood heir."

The orchestra swelled into a waltz just as Nathan began cutting through the crowd with predatory grace. Evelyn's breath hitched when his gloved hand captured hers.

"May I have this dance, Miss Sinclair?" His voice was velvet over steel.

Before she could refuse, Nathan swept her onto the dance floor. The heat of his palm at her waist burned through layers of silk. "You've been avoiding me since Paris."

Evelyn's mask slipped slightly as she tilted her head. "And you've been stalking me since New York."

His lips curved beneath the mask. "Coincidence."

"Six countries worth of coincidence?"

The music crescendoed as Nathan spun her into a shadowed alcove. "I have a proposition for you."

Behind them, Victoria Hayes's crimson gown flashed like a warning signal. Evelyn stiffened. "Your secretary seems distressed."

Nathan didn't turn. "She's irrelevant." His fingers traced the edge of Evelyn's mask. "I need you to pretend to be my fiancée for the season."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken crystal. "You're joking."

"Dead serious." His thumb brushed her jaw. "My father's will stipulates I must marry by year's end or lose controlling shares. You need protection from your stepmother's schemes. Mutual benefit."

The scent of his bergamot cologne wrapped around her as the clock struck midnight. Somewhere in the mansion, a glass shattered. Evelyn's pulse raced—not from fear, but from the dangerous glint in Nathan's eyes.

"Give me one good reason," she challenged.

Nathan's mouth hovered inches from hers. "Because you want to say yes."

A commotion erupted near the terrace doors. Margaret Blackwood's voice cut through the murmurs. "Alexander! What is the meaning of this?"

Nathan's grip tightened. "Decision time, darling. The wolves are at the door."

Evelyn's fingers curled into his lapels. "Three conditions."

"Name them."

"First, no real marriage. Second, I choose our public appearances. Third—" Her words died as Vincent Holloway staggered into view, blood dripping from his nose.

Nathan's body shielded hers instinctively. "Third?"

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "You tell me what really happened in Monte Carlo."

The clock struck its final chime as Nathan's smile turned feral. "Welcome to the game, fiancée."

The penthouse was eerily silent when Evelyn Sinclair stepped inside, her heels clicking against the marble floor like a ticking time bomb. The air smelled faintly of Nathan Blackwood's cologne—that intoxicating blend of sandalwood and spice that used to make her heart race. Now, it only made her stomach churn.

How did we get here?

She traced her fingers along the back of the leather sofa where they'd shared so many late-night conversations, whispered confessions, and stolen kisses. The memories burned like acid in her throat.

Victoria Hayes' smug face flashed in her mind—the way she'd smirked when she dropped the bombshell at the charity gala. "Did Nathan ever tell you about our little arrangement?"

Evelyn's hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. One text. That's all it would take.

To: Nathan Blackwood
We're done.

She hesitated, thumb hovering over the send button. A part of her still wanted to hear his explanation, to believe there was some misunderstanding. But the rational part—the part that had spent sleepless nights piecing together his lies—knew better.

The elevator dinged.

Her pulse spiked. He's home.

Nathan strode in, his tailored suit immaculate as always, but his usually composed expression was fractured. "Evelyn, we need to talk—"

"Save it." She held up her phone, the unsent message glaring between them. "I know everything."

His jaw tightened. "Whatever Victoria told you—"

"Is backed by evidence." She swiped open her tablet, revealing a series of damning emails and transaction records. "Three months. That's how long you've been funneling company funds to her offshore accounts."

The color drained from his face.

Evelyn took a shaky breath. "I trusted you with my company, my heart... and you used both."

Nathan reached for her, but she stepped back, the distance between them suddenly insurmountable.

"Get out," she whispered. "Or I'll call security."

For a heartbeat, he looked like he might argue. Then his shoulders slumped in defeat. As the elevator doors closed behind him, Evelyn finally let the tears fall.

Her phone buzzed.

Unknown Number: You made the right choice. But this isn't over.

Evelyn frowned. Before she could respond, her assistant Lillian Graves burst in, face pale.

"Evelyn—turn on the news."

The screen flashed with a breaking news banner: Blackwood Industries Under Investigation for Fraud.

And just like that, the game changed.


As Celeste  speaking, she drew a shuddering breath before continuing. "I stand by every word and can back it all with proof. I won't take blame for things I didn't do, nor will I let others steal credit for my achievements."

The room erupted in gasps. The revelations were simply too explosive.

The entire industry's perception of the twin sisters—both the praise and scorn—had been built upon those carefully constructed lies. If the truth came out, their reputations would be completely reversed.

"Why would you endure this for so long? Don't you realize how badly this has damaged your image?" someone from the crowd blurted out, unable to contain their shock.

Celeste's laugh was hollow, edged with years of pent-up bitterness. Even she couldn't explain how she'd fallen so deep into this twisted farce.

Perhaps the illusion of a perfect family had been too seductive. Or maybe the loneliness had gnawed at her until she became a willing participant in her own tragedy.

This wasn't her story to bear.

Now, reclaiming her voice, she was finally cutting ties with the Blackwoods.

"Maybe I was just a fool," she murmured.

All eyes swiveled toward the trio—Edward, Penelope, and Isabelle—who stood frozen under the weight of sudden scrutiny. The whispers and judgmental stares were relentless.

Edward's face darkened. "We're family! How could you humiliate us like this?"

Penelope clutched Isabelle's trembling shoulders. "Look what you've done to your sister! Those were just childish mistakes! Do you really think any family with multiple children can be perfectly fair?"

Celeste's smile turned razor-sharp. "Oh, I used to believe that lie too."

The Quirk family exchanged knowing glances. Poor girl—she'd been drowning in the delusion of familial love. Had they not pushed her to the brink, she might have kept sacrificing herself forever. Thank heavens she'd finally awakened.

Nathan Blackwood's relatives nodded in approval. Given recent events, Celeste had proven herself both brilliant and compassionate. They wouldn't let this family drag her down again.

What a pity certain people were too blind to recognize the gem they'd discarded.

The members of the Blackwood family turned their attention toward Julian in silent unison.

At that moment, Julian could only stare at Celeste in stunned silence. His expression was a pitiful mix of shock and devastation.

Richard and Margaret exchanged a glance, sensing this was the perfect opportunity to address certain matters.

Margaret spoke first, her voice firm. "That's an unfair statement, Mrs. Cowell. Our family has four children, and while we may not achieve absolute fairness, we strive for balance. I've never witnessed such blatant favoritism toward one child."

The Cowells hadn't expected the Blackwoods to intervene, and panic rippled through them. The engagement hadn't even been finalized yet.

"No, it's just that our daughter is too headstrong—"

Isabelle burst into tears, turning desperately to Julian. "Julian, do you think I'm a terrible person too? I'm not! I can explain everything! I never realized how much this meant to my sister! I know it's my fault, but I didn't mean to hurt her!"

"Then answer me this," Julian cut in before his mother could respond. "Were you really the one who saved me that day?"

The question sent a shockwave through the Cowell family. They hadn't anticipated him bringing this up now.

The onlookers watched with rapt attention. After all, the entire reason for switching the engagement had been based on that supposed act of heroism.

Celeste, who had remained composed until now, stiffened in disbelief. She turned to her family, her eyes wide with realization.

She had never known the truth.

Because of that fabricated debt, Celeste had been forced to surrender her engagement without protest. Though she was never one to back down, this deception had left her powerless.

Now, hearing that Isabelle had stolen her credit yet again, fury ignited within her.

"It was you… all of you!" Celeste's voice trembled with betrayal. "I was delirious with fever—I couldn’t remember! And you lied to me? Just so your precious Isabelle could take what was mine? How could you do this?"

The Cowells' expressions shifted uncomfortably. There was no excuse for this. How could they admit they had schemed to give their eldest daughter’s fiancé to the younger one simply because they favored her more?

They had kept it hidden from Celeste, never expecting the truth to surface.

But now, with so much exposed, they couldn’t twist the facts. Their past deception hadn’t been flawless—if the Blackwoods investigated, the evidence would be undeniable. They had never imagined being caught, so they hadn’t bothered to cover their tracks.

And now, their lies were unraveling before everyone’s eyes.

The tension in the room was suffocating. No one dared to speak, their breaths shallow as if afraid to disturb the storm brewing before them.

"It was me, not my sister! Julian, you have to believe me!" Isabelle's voice trembled, her eyes wide with desperation. Seeing the skepticism in Julian's gaze, she clutched at straws. "I—I can’t remember clearly! I was ill back then! And you told me—you said you liked me, that it had nothing to do with the past!"

A flicker of crimson flashed in Julian's eyes, his voice colder than winter frost. "Then tell me—was it you I fell for? Or just the mask you wore?"

Isabelle paled, tears cascading down her cheeks like a broken dam. But Julian had no patience left for her theatrics. His gaze shifted to Celeste—only for her to turn away, her expression unreadable.

The truth had been laid bare, yet it meant nothing to her now. If anything, it only deepened her disgust for the three people who had betrayed her.

Julian’s chest tightened painfully as Celeste deliberately avoided his eyes. It felt like something precious had slipped through his fingers, lost forever.

Vincent Holloway’s mind reeled in chaos. "What the hell is going on?!" he roared, jabbing a finger at the Cowells. "Someone better explain! Which one of your daughters was with me for those three months? Who’s responsible for my child’s death? I won’t be made a fool of!"

Before Edward and Penelope could gather their wits, Celeste turned to Vincent, her voice steady. "After everything I’ve said, can’t you figure it out?"

Vincent’s gaze snapped from Celeste to Isabelle. In a flash, he lunged, grabbing Isabelle’s wrist. "Was it you? From May to July, you were in my bed almost every night. If it wasn’t you, then where the hell were you?"

Isabelle shrieked, scrambling behind her parents. "It wasn’t me! I was home! I swear!"

Edward and Penelope exchanged a panicked glance before Edward blurted, "Isabelle was home the entire time! We can vouch for her!"

Vincent’s eyes narrowed, flicking back to Celeste.

The room buzzed with disbelief. Who could have imagined parents would go this far to sacrifice one daughter for another?

Celeste’s stare was glacial, freezing the air around her.

"False statements?" she echoed, her voice dripping with venom. "You want me to take the blame for her? Again?"

Penelope stepped forward, gripping Celeste’s wrist. "Enough! If you have grievances, air them at home! Must you drag your sister down with you?"

Celeste laughed—a hollow, broken sound. "Ah, yes. Because defending myself is ‘talking back.’ Because not surrendering everything to Isabelle is ‘hurting her.’"

Julian’s chest ached as memories flooded him—each one an arrow piercing his heart.

"Reckless?" Celeste’s voice was steel. "I don’t need your forgiveness. Or your compensation. All I want is the truth."

Edward paled. "Celeste—"

She cut him off, turning to Vincent. "I’ll go to any hospital with you. Let them examine me. Let’s see if I’ve ever had a miscarriage."

Silence.

Then—uproar.

Isabelle gaped, horrified. She never expected Celeste to go this far.

Vincent’s gaze locked onto Isabelle like a predator scenting blood.

"You’ve lost your mind!" Edward shouted. "We won’t allow this!"

Penelope sobbed. "How could you humiliate yourself like this?"

Celeste’s lips curled. Humiliation? No. This was liberation.

"Since I’m so worthless in your eyes," she said, voice steady, "from this moment on, I sever all ties with you. I am no longer a Cowell. And I want nothing to do with any of you."

The words hung in the air—final, irrevocable.

The Cowells stared, stunned.

But Celeste was already walking away, her back straight, her heart finally free.

###Chapter 25

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her coffee, the warmth of the mug seeping into her fingers. She had barely slept, her mind still reeling from the confrontation with Victoria Hayes yesterday. The woman’s sharp words had left invisible cuts, but Evelyn refused to let them fester.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

Frowning, she set her cup down and padded across the marble floor. Through the peephole, she saw Nathan Blackwood standing there, his dark hair slightly disheveled, as if he had rushed over.

Her breath hitched.

She hadn’t expected him—not after their last argument, not after the way he had walked out without looking back.

Evelyn hesitated, then pulled the door open.

Nathan’s piercing gaze locked onto hers, his expression unreadable. "We need to talk."

Her pulse quickened. "About what?"

"About us," he said, stepping forward, his presence filling the doorway. "About what you said to Victoria."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "If you're here to defend her—"

"I'm not." His voice was firm, cutting her off. "But I need to know—did you mean it?"

She swallowed. "Mean what?"

"That you still love me."

The air between them thickened, charged with unspoken emotions. Evelyn’s heart hammered against her ribs. She hadn’t planned for this. Hadn’t planned for him to show up and demand answers she wasn’t sure she was ready to give.

Before she could respond, Nathan took another step closer, his fingers brushing against her wrist. "Because I never stopped loving you, Evelyn. Not for a second."

Her breath caught.

Then, from behind him, a familiar voice cut through the tension.

"Well, isn’t this touching?"

Evelyn’s stomach dropped as Victoria Hayes stepped into view, her crimson lips curled into a smirk.

Nathan stiffened. "What are you doing here?"

Victoria’s gaze flickered between them, her smile sharp. "Oh, I just thought I’d drop by and see how my favorite exes were doing." She tilted her head. "But it looks like I interrupted something… interesting."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

Victoria had planned this.

And now, whatever fragile moment she and Nathan had shared—was gone.

The game had just gotten more dangerous.

The grand ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers as Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her emerald-green gown. Across the crowded space, Nathan Blackwood stood like a storm cloud in his tailored tuxedo, his piercing gaze locked onto her. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Victoria Hayes materialized at Evelyn's elbow, her crimson lips curling. "Darling, you look positively desperate," she purred, swirling champagne. "Though I suppose that's understandable, given tonight's... revelations."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her clutch. "Whatever game you're playing, Victoria—"

"Oh, but the game's already over." Victoria's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "Did you truly think Nathan would choose a nobody over family legacy?"

A sudden hush fell as Margaret Blackwood ascended the podium, her silver-streaked hair gleaming. "Ladies and gentlemen," she announced, "the Blackwood Foundation is proud to announce—"

Nathan's voice cut through like thunder. "Mother."

Every head swiveled as he strode forward, his jaw set. "There's been a change in tonight's program." He extended a hand toward Evelyn. "Come here, darling."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Victoria's champagne flute shattered on the marble floor.

"You see," Nathan continued, pulling Evelyn against him, "Ms. Sinclair isn't just our newest philanthropist. She's my fiancée."

Evelyn's breath caught as he produced a velvet box. The diamond inside winked under the lights, its intricate filigree unmistakable—the Blackwood heirloom ring last worn by Nathan's grandmother.

Margaret's face drained of color. "You wouldn't."

"I did." Nathan slid the ring onto Evelyn's finger. "Three weeks ago, in fact."

A commotion erupted near the entrance. Sophia Blackwood burst through, dragging a weeping Adriana Prescott by the wrist. "Brother! Tell them what Daniel's been—" She froze, spotting Evelyn's hand. "Oh. Well. This complicates things."

Lillian Graves chose that moment to stumble in, clutching a manila envelope. "Evelyn! The lab results—" She blanched at the scene. "I'll just... leave this here."

The envelope slid across the floor, spilling its contents—DNA test results bearing the Blackwood crest. Nathan's eyes locked onto one particular page, his expression turning glacial.

"Interesting timing," he murmured, lifting the document. "It seems my father had another child no one knew about." His gaze found Evelyn's. "And she's standing right beside me."

Victoria's scream shattered the silence as Evelyn's knees buckled. The last thing she saw before darkness claimed her was Nathan's arms reaching out, his voice ragged with emotion:

"Welcome to the family, sister."

A suffocating silence engulfed the grand hall. The guests had gorged themselves on revelation after shocking revelation, leaving them breathless.

By severing ties with the Cowell family and calling off her engagement, Celeste was effectively cutting all bridges.

Society had grown accustomed to illegitimate children clawing their way into elite circles. But a privileged young woman voluntarily relinquishing her status? That was unheard of.

The sheer determination behind Celeste's words sent shivers down spines.

Yet given the Cowell family's track record, who knew what schemes they might have dragged her into had she stayed?

"Y-You ungrateful child!" Edward sputtered, veins bulging at his temples.

Tears streamed down Penelope's face. "After everything we've done for you, Celeste! Is this how you repay us?"

"You gave birth to me, but you never raised me." Celeste's voice was ice. "If I'd had a choice, I'd have chosen different parents. At least then I wouldn't have been groomed as Isabelle's personal stepping stone."

The Cowell patriarch and matriarch gaped at their daughter as if seeing her for the first time.

"Stop this madness!" Isabelle suddenly lunged forward, her manicured nails digging into Celeste's wrist hard enough to leave crescent marks. "Even if you're angry, you can't say such horrible things! Do you want to give our parents heart attacks?"

Isabelle's pallor matched her ivory gown as she clung to Celeste like a drowning woman. "Listen," she choked out, "if you don't want to marry Vincent, fine. Break up if you must. But must you create such a spectacle? I admit I was wrong before—taking things that were yours. I understand your resentment, especially since you're fond of Julian and don't want to end the engagement. But can't we discuss this privately?"

Classic Isabelle. Even cornered, she fought dirty. Had Celeste really indulged them so much that they believed she'd back down now?

"Are you deaf, Isabelle? I've proven my innocence. Now it's your turn." Celeste wrenched free with a sharp twist.

Isabelle's face contorted grotesquely. "How dare you demand that of a Cowell heiress!" she shrieked, eyes wild. "Are you trying to kill our parents with grief? Or is this your twisted way of humiliating me? I'm innocent! I don't even know him! If you push me further, I'll—"

With dramatic flourish, Isabelle grabbed crab scissors from the buffet and pressed them to her throat. "My blood will prove my innocence!"

Gasps erupted.

Edward and Penelope descended into hysterics.

"Look what you've done!" Penelope wailed, striking Celeste's shoulder. "Are you trying to murder your sister?"

Edward turned purple with rage. "Happy now? Is this what you wanted? Apologize to Isabelle immediately! We all know it was you with Vincent—why can't you admit it? Must you drive your sister to suicide?"

Celeste's bitter laugh cut through the chaos.

Always the same script. No matter how much pain she endured, Isabelle's theatrics erased everything. The golden child could never be at fault.

Why? Why was she always the sacrificial lamb?

The suffocating injustice stole her voice.

As guests recoiled in shock, the Blackwoods' expressions darkened. Then—

CRACK!

A silver tray connected with Isabelle's head, sending her sprawling. The scissors clattered across marble.

All eyes swiveled to Evelyn Sinclair, who calmly set down her impromptu weapon.

"Thank heavens I anticipated her little performance," Evelyn drawled. "Playing victim? Shifting blame? Emotional blackmail? Please. Celeste finally breaks free, and this viper tries to drag her back? Over my dead body."

Had Isabelle drawn even a drop of blood, Celeste would've borne the stigma forever—the cruel sister who drove her twin to suicide.

Nathan Blackwood signaled sharply. Security swarmed in, pinning the dazed Isabelle.

"Unhand her!" Edward roared.

Nathan's smile was arctic. "Given your daughter's... instability, we're ensuring everyone's safety until your departure."

The crowd exhaled collectively, praising Evelyn's quick thinking.

Isabelle thrashed against her restraints. "Julian! Help me!"

But Julian's gaze remained fixed on Celeste, who stood motionless, staring at the fallen scissors with unsettling intensity.

Vincent chuckled darkly. "At least I never impersonated anyone to manipulate feelings. Or threatened suicide when caught." He produced his phone with a flourish. "Shall we compare more... intimate photos? Surely you twins aren't identical everywhere?"

The threat sent horrified whispers through the crowd.

"Liar!" Isabelle screamed.

Celeste remained eerily still. The contrast was damning.

Realization drained the color from Isabelle's face.

"Got you." Vincent smirked. Turning to Celeste, he added, "My apologies. Your sister fooled me too."

"It wasn't me!" Isabelle's shrieks turned feral. "Julian, look at me! Mom! Dad! Tell them it was Celeste!"

When no one moved, she snarled at Celeste, "Just take the blame like always! Haven't you done it a hundred times before?"

Celeste tilted her head. "Why would I?"

The quiet question hung like a guillotine.

Pitying glances turned toward Celeste while disgusted ones raked over Isabelle—and her parents.

One could almost see them in a hospital nursery years ago, blaming infant Celeste for "stealing nutrients" from her sickly twin. Some patterns never changed.

Edward and Penelope looked shell-shocked. Their perfect daughter's venomous core had been exposed.

Celeste's laugh was hollow. "All those times you 'defended' me... you were actually feeding the rumors, weren't you? You don't just want their love—you want me destroyed."

Isabelle might not even love Julian. Stealing him was simply another way to obliterate Celeste.

Isabelle trembled with rage. "If you don't confess, you'll regret it!"

Evelyn's scoff echoed the room's sentiment. What kind of monster had the Cowells raised?

Then—

"Never again."

Celeste snatched up the scissors and slashed toward her own face.

A hand intercepted the blade.

Julian stood before her, blood dripping from his palm where the scissors had bitten deep.

(Evelyn had seen Celeste's intention and gasped—giving Julian that crucial second to react.)

Celeste stared blankly at Julian's bleeding hand. "Let go," she whispered. "I'm done being her scapegoat. Done having my life stolen. If disfiguring myself is the only way out, so be it."

Her voice broke on the last word, the sound of a soul pushed beyond endurance.

###Chapter 26

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced nervously by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Her fingers trembled slightly as she scrolled through her phone for the tenth time that hour. Still no reply from Nathan Blackwood.

"Stop torturing yourself," Lillian Graves chided, placing a steaming cup of chamomile tea on the marble counter. "The man clearly needs space after what happened at the gala."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. The memory of Vincent Holloway's drunken advances still burned fresh in her mind—how Nathan had intervened with that dangerous glint in his eyes, how his knuckles had turned white around his champagne flute.

A sharp knock at the door startled them both.

"Expecting someone?" Lillian arched an eyebrow.

Evelyn's pulse quickened as she smoothed her silk robe. "Not unless..." Her breath hitched. Could it be him?

But when she swung the door open, it was Preston Whitmore standing there, his usually immaculate suit rumpled, dark circles under his eyes. "We have a situation," the director said without preamble.

Behind him, Donovan Sharpe shifted uncomfortably, avoiding Evelyn's questioning gaze.

Preston thrust a tablet into her hands. The screen displayed a gossip column with a damning headline: Blackwood Heir's Dark Secret Exposed - Is Evelyn Sinclair His Latest Victim?

Evelyn's stomach dropped as she skimmed the article detailing Nathan's alleged involvement in a high-profile corporate scandal years ago—one that had ruined several families. The accompanying photo showed a younger Nathan leaving a courthouse, his expression unreadable behind dark sunglasses.

"This changes everything," Preston said grimly. "The studio's getting cold feet about your project together. Sponsors are pulling out."

Lillian snatched the tablet, her eyes widening. "This has to be Victoria Hayes' doing. That woman's been after Evelyn's roles for years."

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists. The timing was too perfect—right after Nathan had publicly defended her honor. "Where is he now?" she demanded.

Donovan cleared his throat. "Word is he's holed up at the Blackwood estate. No one's seen him since last night."

A notification pinged on Evelyn's phone. Her heart leapt—but it was just Serena Whitmore, her agent: Emergency meeting in 30. Wear something devastating.

Evelyn stared at the message, then at the tablet's damning revelations. The man she'd started falling for had hidden this from her. But as betrayal coiled in her chest, another emotion fought its way to the surface—determination.

"Tell Serena I'll be there in twenty," Evelyn said, already striding toward her closet. "And someone get me Nathan Blackwood's private number. If he thinks he can ghost me after everything, he's got another thing coming."

Lillian exchanged glances with Preston. "What are you planning?"

Evelyn selected a crimson power dress from her rack, the color of warning and war. "I'm going to get answers. And then?" She met their worried gazes with steel in her own. "We're going to destroy whoever did this."

The moment Evelyn Sinclair opened her phone, her heart skipped a beat.

Nathan Blackwood had blocked her.

She stared at the screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard, as if waiting for some kind of glitch—some mistake that would prove this wasn’t real. But the cold, hard truth stared back at her. No profile picture. No last seen. Just a blank space where his name used to be.

Her chest tightened.

Why?

Had she done something wrong? Said something she shouldn’t have? The last time they spoke, everything had been… fine. Or so she thought.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Fine. What a joke.

She tossed her phone onto the couch, running a hand through her hair. This shouldn’t hurt. She shouldn’t care. But the sting was sharp, undeniable.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, walked in, holding a stack of scripts. "Evelyn, we need to go over—" She stopped mid-sentence, taking in Evelyn’s expression. "What happened?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Nathan blocked me."

Lillian blinked. "Wait. Nathan Blackwood? The guy who couldn’t take his eyes off you at the gala? The one who sent you flowers last week?"

"That’s the one."

Lillian frowned, setting the scripts down. "That makes no sense."

"Tell me about it." Evelyn picked up her phone again, as if it would magically unblock itself. Nothing.

Then, a thought struck her.

She opened her messages, scrolling through her conversation with Victoria Hayes—Nathan’s secretary and, coincidentally, the woman who had made it clear she despised Evelyn.

Had Victoria done this?

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. It wouldn’t be the first time someone had interfered where they shouldn’t.

But before she could spiral further, her phone buzzed.

An unknown number.

Her breath hitched as she read the message:

"We need to talk. It’s not what you think."

Her pulse raced.

Because even without a name attached, she knew.

It was him.

And whatever this was… it was far from over.

"Darling, you've got it all wrong," Evelyn Sinclair sighed in exasperation, her voice laced with frustration. "The point was to ruin her face, not your own. What were you thinking?"

The Blackwood family exchanged bewildered glances, their expressions a mix of horror and disbelief. Why was Celeste the one hurting herself when Isabelle was the one who deserved retribution?

But of course, they couldn’t actually condone physical harm—not when Celeste was the innocent one, the one who had fought so hard to reclaim her dignity. She didn’t deserve to stain her hands—or her reputation—with violence.

Nathan and Margaret Blackwood stared at Celeste, their faces drained of color, as if they might collapse from the sheer absurdity of the situation. The day had already been a relentless storm of shocks, and this was the final gust threatening to knock them over.

Isabelle, however, was seething, her crimson eyes locked onto Celeste and Julian with venomous intensity.

Celeste was at her breaking point. No matter how she altered her appearance, Isabelle always found a way to copy her. It was maddening. She had run out of options, out of patience—out of hope.

Seeing the devastation in Celeste’s eyes, Julian’s chest tightened painfully.

"You walked away from everything to start fresh," Julian said, his voice rough with emotion. "So why are you destroying yourself over people who don’t matter? Wasn’t the whole point to heal? What are you doing?"

Well, well. Julian finally speaks sense. Has he finally shaken off that naïve delusion of his?

Ignoring Evelyn’s biting sarcasm, Julian turned to his family with a silent plea. He knew Celeste wouldn’t listen to him—not after he had just opposed her.

Evelyn stepped forward, resting a comforting hand on Celeste’s shoulder. "You’ve done enough. Don’t punish yourself for her sins."

"She’s right, sweetheart," Margaret chimed in gently, while Sophia moved to steady Celeste’s trembling hands. "Theodore told me how stunning you are—that’s something no one can steal from you."

"And from now on, we will tell you apart," Richard declared firmly. "No more confusion. No more games."

Surrounded by their reassurances, Celeste felt a warmth spread through her chest, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

The others, unable to bear her distress any longer, rushed to console her.

"We know the truth now," Sophia said softly. "If anyone dares to twist things again, we’ll investigate. We were blind before, but we see clearly now."

Seizing the moment, Julian swiftly snatched the scissors from Celeste’s grip and hurled them aside.

The sharp clang of metal hitting the floor echoed through the room—a final, decisive end to the madness.

Celeste inhaled sharply, her voice steady despite the storm inside. "Thank you, but I let my emotions get the best of me."


Truthfully, she wasn’t reckless—just wounded. The shock had shattered her composure, but now, clarity returned like ice water. She wouldn’t self-destruct. Not for them.

Her gaze swept over the trio. "It’s settled. We’re done."

"Celeste, wait—" Penelope reached out, desperation threading her tone.

"I meant what I said," Celeste replied, frost lacing every syllable. "I’m no longer your daughter."

"Enough." Edward’s voice cracked like a whip.

Their blind defense of Isabelle made her stomach churn. No matter how she pleaded, they’d never see the truth. They mistook her resolve for a tantrum, oblivious to how years of neglect had eroded her love. This wasn’t impulse—it was emancipation.

"Don’t call. Don’t visit. If you insist on forcing this farce, sue me. I’ll pay whatever the court orders. Not a cent more."

Her words were precise, rehearsed. She’d mapped this exit long ago.

Edward and Penelope paled, finally grasping her sincerity. Their smug certainty crumbled, leaving hollow panic. How could their obedient girl walk away?

She always endured everything! All we asked was for her to help Isabelle—just a little sacrifice. Was cutting ties really necessary?

But Celeste denied them even regret. Turning to the Blackwoods, she bowed. "My apologies for disrupting your evening."

"The event was winding down," Julian interjected swiftly. "No harm done."

Celeste met his gaze, detached. "I’ll be leaving now."

"Let me drive you!" Julian blurted.

A glacial pause. "No."

She strode away, the crowd parting like the Red Sea. This wasn’t an exit—it was a rebirth.

Behind her, Edward and Penelope’s cries twisted between fury and grief. Useless. She didn’t glance back.

When they turned, Isabelle lay in a dramatic heap, unconscious.

Sympathy had long abandoned Evelyn Sinclair.

As the humiliated Edward and Penelope hastily departed with Isabelle in tow, Vincent Holloway scrambled after them like a desperate puppy.

Daphne and her husband offered profuse apologies to the Blackwood family, their faces burning with secondhand embarrassment. "This is entirely Vincent's doing. That boy has brought nothing but disgrace upon our family name."

"Indeed, we're victims in this farce," Margaret Blackwood replied through clenched teeth. "Who would've thought the Holloways would stoop so low?"

"Let's pretend this never happened," Daphne simpered, forcing a smile. "Who knows? Our families might still become connected someday."

The matriarchs exchanged hollow pleasantries, their words dripping with insincerity.

Daphne added awkwardly, "We could never accept a woman like that into our family. Honestly, I can't tell if Vincent genuinely cares for Isabelle or if he's just trying to spite Julian. Your children are far superior, especially... your youngest daughter."

Margaret's expression darkened instantly. Just as she prepared to unleash her wrath, Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like a knife.

"Why do you think Vincent pursued Isabelle so relentlessly? It's simple—he's practically sterile." Evelyn popped a grape into her mouth with theatrical nonchalance. "At first, he probably just wanted a rebound. Then he discovered Isabelle could actually bear his child. Suddenly, the playboy wants commitment. Pathetic, really."

Margaret's face twisted with conflicting emotions—the urge to mock Daphne warring with her need to maintain decorum. Behind her, Sophia pretended to cough while Julian snorted derisively.

Nathan, however, remained the picture of composure, though his gaze toward Evelyn held a mixture of exasperation and reluctant amusement. What trashy tabloids had his fiancée been reading?

"To future family alliances," Richard Blackwood said icily, raising his wine glass in a mock toast.

The Holloways could bear no more. They fled with the remaining guests, their tails between their legs.

All eyes kept drifting toward Julian, who sat stiffly in his chair.

"Spit it out already," Julian finally snapped under the weight of their stares.

"Do you have feelings for Celeste?" Margaret asked bluntly.

Julian's head whipped toward Evelyn, his expression caught between embarrassment and frustration.

Richard finally took pity on his son. With a wordless pat on Julian's shoulder, he guided his wife upstairs, leaving the younger generation to their drama.

Noticing Evelyn had  her fruit, Nathan stood. "Evelyn, my study. We need to talk."

Soon, only Julian remained at the dining table, nursing his wounded pride.

Just as he considered retreating, Genevieve's voice came through his phone: "What a shame. I always thought Celeste would become my sister-in-law. She's the woman you've known longest, after all."

Julian froze. "Is that... true?" Why didn't he remember any of this?

"Of course! Childhood sweethearts, practically destined. You always preferred her company—even made me play your daughter in childhood games while she got to be your wife. You swore you'd marry her someday."

"You promised to marry Celeste when you grew up," Genevieve said softly, her voice tinged with nostalgia. "You told her you'd build a life together. You even kissed her cheek that day. It was after our grandmothers witnessed that moment they decided to arrange your engagement."

Julian froze.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

So, it was me. I was the reason for our engagement. A childhood promise—one I made to her, swearing we'd have a future together. How could I have forgotten something so important? What kind of man does that make me?

"Julian… are you crying?" Genevieve's voice was laced with surprise.

He wiped his face roughly with the back of his hand, his voice rough. "You remember so much. Tell me more about us back then."

"Hmm? Honestly, I don’t recall much. We weren’t even in the same grade." She sighed. "After you started school, you barely spent time with Celeste—or with me. You said boys should only play with boys. Then, one day, your classmates found out about the engagement and teased you mercilessly. You were so embarrassed you lashed out. After that… Celeste stopped coming over. And suddenly, all you cared about was Isabelle."

Julian clenched his jaw. Because I owed her for saving my life.

He remembered the years that followed. His family constantly reminded him to visit the Cowells, given the engagement.

But in truth, it had only been a verbal agreement—no ceremony, no formal commitment. To Julian, it had always felt flimsy, more like an obligation than a real bond. He never saw it as binding, never treated it as something sacred.

So when he fell for Isabelle, he didn’t think twice. He didn’t feel guilty. He didn’t believe he was betraying Celeste. Most of his visits were just to check on the sickly Isabelle.

Yet every time he was there, Edward and Penelope would sing Isabelle’s praises while criticizing Celeste. And Celeste? She just stood there, silent, absorbing every word without protest.

How many times had she been wrongly accused? How many times had he confronted her on Isabelle’s behalf, only for her to remain quiet, never defending herself?

Before he arrived, she had already failed to make her parents see reason. And when she saw how devoted he was to Isabelle, she gave up trying. All she could do was wear that blank, unreadable expression.

Julian wondered—if she had just explained herself, just once, would he have listened? Would he have questioned things, sought the truth, and believed her?

Yes. At least in the beginning, he would have.

But she never did. She let his misunderstandings pile up, let his trust in Isabelle grow unchecked. Until, without realizing it, he had been conditioned to believe every word against her.

He couldn’t blame her for his blindness. He had failed to see her pain, failed to recognize the truth.

And now, he had lost her.

What a fool I’ve been.

A wave of regret crashed over him. I messed up. I should never have let her walk away. The realization hit Julian like a punch to the gut. He couldn’t bear the thought of losing Celeste—not now, not ever.

His fingers trembled as he dialed her number, his pulse racing with each unanswered ring. Why isn’t she picking up? Desperation clawed at him. He should’ve insisted on driving her home earlier. Screw pride. I should’ve fought harder.

When the call went to voicemail, he typed out a message, his thumbs moving frantically across the screen:

"Do you have somewhere safe to stay? Let me know if you need anything. I still owe you for saving my life, and I haven’t repaid that debt yet. Just… tell me you’re okay."

Silence.

He waited, his breath shallow, eyes glued to his phone. Nothing.

Swallowing hard, he tried calling again—only to be met with an automated voice. "The number you are trying to reach is unavailable—"

His stomach dropped.

A cold sweat broke across his skin as he attempted to send another text. This time, a glaring red exclamation mark flashed back at him.

His heart stopped.

She blocked me.

The truth settled like ice in his veins.

Celeste was gone.

And it was entirely his fault.

###Chapter 27

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her where Nathan Blackwood had been just hours before. The scent of his cologne still lingered, a tantalizing reminder of their stolen moments.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Lillian Graves' name flashed across the screen. "Evelyn, we have a situation," her assistant's voice was clipped, urgent. "Victoria Hayes just leaked photos of you and Nathan to the press. They're everywhere."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She scrambled out of bed, nearly tripping over the silk sheets in her haste to grab her tablet. The headlines screamed at her: Evelyn Sinclair's Secret Affair with Married Billionaire Nathan Blackwood! Accompanying the article were grainy but unmistakable photos of them leaving a private hotel together last week.

Her hands trembled. This wasn't just a scandal—it was a carefully orchestrated attack. Victoria had been waiting for this moment, biding her time to strike.

The intercom buzzed. "Ms. Sinclair? Mr. Blackwood is here," the doorman announced.

Nathan stormed in moments later, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled. "Evelyn, we need to—"

"Damage control?" she interrupted bitterly. "It's a little late for that, don't you think?"

He ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident. "This isn't just about us. My board is already calling for an emergency meeting. If this affects the merger—"

"Of course," Evelyn scoffed. "Always the business first." She turned away, wrapping her arms around herself. The warmth of last night felt like a cruel joke now.

Nathan's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and grimaced. "It's Margaret."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Nathan's mother had never approved of their relationship, and this would only fuel her disapproval.

As Nathan stepped out to take the call, Evelyn's own phone rang again. This time, it was Preston Whitmore, the director of her upcoming film. "Evelyn, the studio is panicking. They're talking about recasting your role if this scandal doesn't die down soon."

Her career, her reputation—everything was crumbling because of one vindictive woman.

Nathan returned, his expression grim. "We need to make a statement. Together."

Evelyn met his gaze, her resolve hardening. "No. I'll handle this my way." She picked up her phone and dialed Serena Whitmore, her agent. "Serena, I need you to set up an interview. Today."

Nathan's eyes widened. "Evelyn, what are you planning?"

She gave him a small, determined smile. "If Victoria wants a war, she's going to get one."

Evelyn Sinclair found herself unemployed after her previous manager was blacklisted.

Even though she had decided to take a break and enjoy life, doing so indefinitely was proving far too dull.

After Theodore left for school, Sophia Blackwood was instructed by Richard to refamiliarize herself with the operations of the family’s hospital.

Margaret, meanwhile, spent her afternoons sipping coffee with old friends. That left Evelyn—friendless, jobless, and utterly bored.

After some thought, she decided it was a waste of her striking looks. Why not return to the entertainment industry and carve out a name for herself?

Not only would she get front-row seats to all the drama, but she’d also be surrounded by gorgeous men and women. It was the perfect way to scout her next romance while effortlessly padding her bank account. She could even stash away a divorce fund—just in case Nathan eventually left her for his first love.

Pleased with her plan, she mentioned it to Nathan.

He had promised to help her find a new agency, but Evelyn never expected him to let her interview potential managers herself.

Unfortunately, no serious candidates showed up. She was still a newcomer, after all.

And the entertainment industry? A notorious den of scandals. Finding someone with integrity was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Even if they tried to hide their true nature, Evelyn could see right through them.

The interviews were a complete disaster. Not a single promising candidate.

She worried Nathan might lose patience, but he remained silent, watching as no one stepped forward.

Finally, he sent her to Julian’s agency.

When she arrived, Evelyn was completely baffled.

The office held only two people.

Julian lounged lazily on the couch, scrolling through his phone. He glanced up when she entered, acknowledging her with a nod.

Surprisingly, since the incident, his attitude toward her had improved dramatically.

Ah, the trials of love—nothing like heartbreak to force maturity.

Julian’s movements were stiff, as if he were wrestling with his emotions.

At the conference table sat his manager.

Evelyn blinked.

This was going to be interesting.

"Good afternoon, Ms. Sinclair. I'm Marcus Donovan, Mr. Blackwood's agent. I've also received direct instructions from Mr. Nathan Blackwood himself. Starting today, I'll be guiding your career in the entertainment industry. Here's your contract. Once signed, you'll officially become the second artist under my management."

Marcus adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses with a practiced smile. The middle-aged man radiated warmth, but those familiar with the industry knew better—he was a shark in a tailored suit.

Evelyn's gaze flickered from Marcus to Julian Blackwood standing several feet away. The man practically vibrated with barely contained irritation.

"You agreed?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Weren't you vehemently opposed to this arrangement last week?"

She wasn't about to let him backtrack later if this was some reluctant concession.

The muscle in Julian's jaw twitched. "What happened before... stays in the past. As my sister-in-law now, having you under my agency will give Nathan peace of mind."

"Really?" Evelyn suppressed a shiver. "Since when did you care about Nathan's peace of mind?"

Julian's expression darkened.

Marcus cleared his throat awkwardly. Nathan had warned him about their history—how Julian had threatened to walk out if Evelyn joined the agency. Their animosity was legendary.

Truthfully, Julian owed Evelyn for the Celeste incident. Without her intervention, he'd still be making a fool of himself. But years of hostility couldn't dissolve overnight.

When Nathan proposed this arrangement again, Julian acquiesced. With Evelyn's true identity needing protection in the industry, his agency could provide both shield and guidance.

Evelyn tapped the contract with a manicured nail. "Even as agency head, I won't blindly follow your directives. I choose my projects. Do we have an understanding?"

"Of course," Marcus said smoothly. "The contract reflects that. Please review clause 12-B."

Evelyn scanned the document—then froze. Her breath caught at the numbers staring back at her.

Evelyn had the freedom to choose any job she wanted—no restrictions, no strings attached. She could take breaks whenever she pleased, and the best part? Full profit sharing.

Back in her old agency, they’d taken a brutal 70-30 cut. But here? Julian was letting her keep everything. It was almost as if Marcus was working for free.

“Don’t you want a cut?” Evelyn blurted, baffled.

Marcus chuckled. “Oh, don’t worry. Mr. Blackwood covers our salaries.”

To him, this wasn’t strange at all. Just Julian looking out for his sister-in-law.

When the realization hit, Evelyn’s eyes widened, darting to Julian in disbelief.

Julian, assuming she had nothing left to say, kept his gaze fixed on his phone.

But then—

He’s really been destroyed by heartbreak. He doesn’t care about anything anymore.

Julian’s fingers stilled. He exhaled sharply. “Are you signing or not?”

Obviously, she wasn’t about to refuse free money. Evelyn snatched the pen and scribbled her signature.

Outwardly, she remained composed. Inwardly? A full-blown victory dance.

Her mental soundtrack was loud—completely off-key, but she didn’t care. She even threw in some improvised lyrics.

For someone like Julian, whose ears were trained for perfection, it was torture.

Marcus accepted the contract with a polite smile. “Ms. Sinclair, what kind of work interests you? From my research, you’ve mostly done print campaigns.”

Evelyn waved a hand. “Forget my past. Right now, I just want something easy with big paychecks.”

Marcus’s smile faltered. Julian’s expression flatlined.

Born into wealth, Julian couldn’t relate—but he also couldn’t be bothered to argue.

“Fine. High pay, low effort,” he muttered. Then, as an afterthought, “And no singing.”

Marcus, ever the professional, smoothed his expression. “Of course. I’ll find something suitable.”

He turned to Evelyn. “Unless you have objections?”

Julian gave her a weary glance. Arguing took energy—energy he’d lost that night.

Should I tell him Celeste is leaving the country?

No. Regret had no cure. Late affection meant nothing. Chasing lost love? Nearly impossible.

With no connections in Celeste’s circle, Julian was stuck. All he could do was obsessively refresh her social media, desperate for updates.

Same city, yet they might as well be oceans apart. If she left? Hopeless.

A flicker of panic crossed Julian’s face. He stood abruptly.

This time, he’d camp outside her lab if he had to. He needed to see her. There was so much left unsaid.

As Julian turned to leave, Marcus hesitated. “About tonight’s wine-tasting event… will you…?”

For Marcus, this was bittersweet. The upside? No more cleaning up Isabelle’s messes. Even as a non-manager, she’d dragged him into disasters—always with sweet words and zero remorse.

The problem was clear—Julian's golden goose had stopped laying eggs, hopelessly tangled in the web of love. A sentimental soul like him could take ages to recover, leaving his manager Marcus utterly exasperated.

As for the upcoming red wine tasting event, Marcus knew Julian wouldn’t attend. The original plan had been to accept the invitation to help Evelyn Sinclair expand her connections. Now, there was no reason for Julian to bother with such things.

Yet, just moments ago, Marcus had a sudden stroke of inspiration. "I think it would be beneficial for Ms. Sinclair to attend," he suggested. "There’s no immediate financial gain, but it could open doors for her future. Strictly speaking, she’s still a newcomer to our agency and needs industry recognition. That’s the only way offers will come in. Otherwise, if we’re always chasing opportunities, our options will be limited. I initially hoped you’d accompany her, but since you’re not interested, I’ll go with her instead. The event is out of town, so we might have to stay overnight."

Julian turned to Evelyn. "It’s your call. Just let Nathan know your decision—I’m busy right now. If you want to go, Marcus will take you."

Evelyn flashed an 'OK' sign with a playful grin.

With that, Julian turned and strode toward the door.

Curious, Evelyn asked Marcus, "Where’s the venue?"

Marcus chuckled. "The Silvinubis Hotel."

"That name sounds familiar..."

"Of course! It’s a five-star luxury resort."

But that wasn’t why it rang a bell. Oh—right! The scientific research sponsorship event Celeste had posted about on Instagram was being held there.

BANG!

Both Evelyn and Marcus jolted at the sudden noise, whipping around to see Julian caught halfway through the door—one foot out, the other still inside. The door had slammed shut on him before he could fully exit, an absurd sight for someone usually so composed.

Evelyn burst into laughter. "Pfft—!"

Marcus, on the other hand, barely managed to stifle his amusement.

"Ahem... you alright, Julian?" Marcus asked, bewildered.

"Uh... forgot something," Julian muttered, rubbing the red mark on his forehead as he shuffled back toward the couch. His gaze kept flickering toward Evelyn.

Wait... Evelyn can see Celeste’s Instagram posts? When did they even follow each other?

Nathan and Sophia didn’t have Celeste’s contact info, and Genevieve—after defending Julian a few times—had been promptly blocked by her.

How in the world had Evelyn pulled it off?

It was like having a golden ticket right under your nose but failing to see it.


The two women had swapped numbers when Evelyn lent Celeste a dress weeks ago. Since Evelyn had never reached out first, Celeste simply forgot to block her.

The event link had been shared casually—Celeste never imagined anyone would actually notice it.

Meanwhile, Marcus was still discussing hotel arrangements with Evelyn. "Think of it as a mini getaway, Ms. Sinclair. The place has endless activities. You won’t even feel tired."

Let me check… Just as predicted, Celeste and her classmates had already left for their fundraising trip. They’d probably stay at the hotel overnight—the perfect chance to invite her out. I’ve taken quite a liking to her. Thankfully, Julian isn’t tagging along. Otherwise, there’d be no way I could ask Celeste out. Sigh, it’s not that I don’t want to help, but you two are fated to cross paths, not to be together!

Julian was utterly speechless.

###Chapter 28

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the grand ballroom, all eyes turned toward her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the room, but none of it compared to the way she carried herself—graceful, poised, and effortlessly radiant.

Nathan Blackwood stood near the balcony doors, a glass of whiskey in hand, his sharp gaze tracking her every move. He hadn’t expected her to attend tonight’s event, not after their last heated argument. Yet here she was, dressed in a midnight-blue gown that clung to her curves, her dark hair cascading over one shoulder like a silken waterfall.

Victoria Hayes, his ever-watchful secretary, leaned in with a smirk. "She looks stunning, doesn’t she?"

Nathan didn’t respond, but his fingers tightened around his glass.

Across the room, Evelyn felt the weight of his stare. She refused to glance his way, focusing instead on the conversation with Serena Whitmore, her agent.

"You’re making quite the entrance," Serena murmured, sipping her champagne.

Evelyn smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. "I’m here for the charity auction, not for him."

Serena arched a brow. "Then why did you wear that dress?"

Before Evelyn could retort, the host announced the start of the auction. The first item—a rare diamond necklace—was displayed, and bidding began.

Nathan’s deep voice cut through the murmurs. "Fifty thousand."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. Of course he’d do this—flaunt his wealth, remind everyone of his power. She raised her hand. "Sixty."

His eyes locked onto hers, a challenge burning in them. "Seventy."

The room held its breath.

Evelyn’s pulse raced. This wasn’t just about the necklace anymore. It was about pride, about proving she wouldn’t back down.

"Eighty," she countered.

A slow, dangerous smile curved Nathan’s lips. "One hundred."

Silence.

Then, the host stammered, "S-Sold to Mr. Blackwood!"

Evelyn turned away, her cheeks flushed with frustration. She didn’t see Nathan’s expression darken as she strode toward the exit.

But he wasn’t done.

Before she could leave, his hand caught her wrist, pulling her into a secluded alcove.

"What do you think you’re doing?" she hissed.

Nathan’s voice was low, rough. "You wanted the necklace?" He reached into his pocket and pulled out the glittering diamonds. "Take it."

She recoiled. "I don’t want your pity."

"It’s not pity." His thumb brushed her pulse point, sending a shiver down her spine. "It’s an apology."

Evelyn froze.

For the first time, she saw something raw in his eyes—regret.

The moment stretched between them, charged and uncertain.

Then, footsteps approached.

Victoria’s voice rang out, sharp and impatient. "Nathan, they’re waiting for you."

He didn’t move, his gaze still locked on Evelyn.

She stepped back, her heart pounding. "Go."

Nathan hesitated, then finally released her. But as he walked away, he left the necklace in her palm.

Evelyn stared at it, her emotions in turmoil.

This wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

The studio lights burned brighter than usual that afternoon, casting harsh shadows across Evelyn Sinclair's face as she stood frozen behind the velvet curtains. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as she watched the scene unfold on set - Nathan Blackwood leaning dangerously close to Seraphina Delacroix, his fingers brushing a stray lock of hair from her shoulder with practiced ease.

"Cut!" Preston Whitmore's voice cracked through the tension like a whip. "Let's reset for take twelve."

Evelyn's assistant Lillian Graves materialized at her elbow, pressing an iced latte into her trembling hands. "You look like you've seen a ghost," Lillian murmured. "Should I call your agent?"

Before Evelyn could respond, a commotion erupted near craft services. Sebastian Hart, Seraphina's notoriously volatile ex, had just stormed onto set, his designer sunglasses doing little to conceal the fury twisting his handsome features.

"Interesting timing," Nathan's brother Julian remarked, appearing suddenly at Evelyn's other side. His smirk was all sharp edges. "Just when the tabloids started running those photos of you and my brother at the gala last night."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She'd seen the headlines - "Blackwood's New Muse?" splashed across every entertainment site that morning. The staged paparazzi shots had been Serena Whitmore's idea, part of some convoluted PR strategy for Nathan's upcoming film.

Across the soundstage, Nathan finally noticed her presence. His gaze locked onto hers with startling intensity, even as Seraphina whispered something that made him laugh. The sound grated against Evelyn's nerves like sandpaper.

"Five minutes!" the assistant director called.

Lillian squeezed Evelyn's arm. "You okay to do this scene?"

Evelyn straightened her shoulders, channeling every ounce of her Juilliard training. "Darling," she said with a brittle smile, "I was born ready."

But as she stepped into the blinding lights, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another scene. The air crackled with unspoken tensions - between her and Nathan, between Sebastian and Seraphina, between the carefully constructed facades and the messy truths lurking beneath.

Somewhere in the shadows, a camera flash went off. Evelyn forced her lips into a flawless smile. Let them take their pictures. The real drama was just beginning.

After sending Nathan a quick text, Evelyn slipped into the sleek black SUV arranged by the agency.



Within minutes, Marcus Donovan arrived with the new assistant, Lillian Graves, and the styling team at the luxurious Silvinubis Hotel in the neighboring city.

The fanfare surrounding Evelyn’s arrival was so extravagant that onlookers might have mistaken her for Julian Blackwood himself. When an industry acquaintance approached to greet them, their jaw nearly dropped at the sight of the breathtaking woman beside Marcus.

Those in the know were aware that Julian had recently ended things with Isabelle. No one expected him to replace her so swiftly—and with a woman escorted by his personal team, no less. This was gossip gold.

Sharp-eyed attendees might have recognized Evelyn from Quirk Group’s billboards and magazine spreads, making her sudden appearance with Julian’s entourage even more intriguing.

"Marcus, long time no see! Where’s Mr. Blackwood been hiding lately? And who’s this stunning companion?"

"This is Evelyn Sinclair, our agency’s newest talent. I trust everyone will give her a warm welcome."

"Come on, Marcus, don’t hold out on us. What’s her connection to Julian?"

"Purely professional. She comes from high society—this is just a passion project for her."

Marcus emphasized the point to avoid unnecessary rumors. Besides, anyone with half a brain would uncover her background soon enough.

At the exclusive red wine tasting, Marcus handled all the networking. Evelyn simply followed his lead, sipping her wine with practiced grace and memorizing names with a polite smile.

The level of protection Marcus provided only heightened the room’s curiosity about her status.

The entire event unfolded with Marcus skillfully maneuvering through conversations while Evelyn observed, thoroughly amused by the spectacle.

Still, with more staff than celebrities present, the gossip remained contained.

Just as boredom began to creep in, Evelyn turned—and nearly spilled her drink.

Isabelle was striding straight toward them.


Evelyn finally understood why Celeste had once wanted to disfigure herself. That face—when it appeared—could truly make one's mind go blank for a moment. The sheer revulsion it stirred in Celeste was palpable.

But more importantly—what was she doing here?

Isabelle had come specifically for Marcus. From across the room, she'd spotted Marcus and assumed Julian would be with him. Instead, it was Evelyn standing by his side.

She hesitated, not daring to offend Evelyn directly. "Marcus," she asked anxiously, "is Julian here?"

Marcus forced a professional smile despite his irritation. "No."

Isabelle's eyes narrowed. "Or is he avoiding me?"

Though she didn't raise her voice much, the commotion drew curious glances from nearby guests. Marcus's jaw tightened. If the press caught wind of this, it would trend within hours. The previous rumors about them were headache enough.

As an agent, letting his client face such scandals was unacceptable. Knowing Isabelle wouldn't listen to reason, Marcus had to redirect. "Ms. Isabelle, perhaps we should continue this conversation elsewhere?"

"Fine. Take me to Julian."

Marcus's expression froze as he glanced at Evelyn.

Evelyn was equally exasperated. Celeste's luck truly had run out. If the twins crossed paths now, she feared the unhinged Isabelle might cause a scene.

Seeing Marcus's look, Evelyn said, "I'm tired anyway. I'll take a walk around—just Lillian with me is fine."

Marcus nodded, swiftly exiting with his team, leaving behind disappointed onlookers craving more drama.

The Silvinubis Hotel comprised three wings: one for dining and leisure, another for accommodations, and the third for events.

After parting with Marcus, Evelyn returned to her suite to change. Simultaneously, she texted Celeste:

"At Silvinubis for an event. Thought I saw you—are you here too?"

No reply.

Evelyn wasn't sure if Celeste hadn't seen the message or was deliberately ignoring her. After all, as Julian's sister-in-law, she might be someone Celeste wanted to erase from her life completely.

The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken tensions, as Evelyn stepped out into the gilded hallway—unaware of the storm about to break.

Despite her best intentions, Evelyn Sinclair gave Celeste a subtle warning. "By the way, I spotted Isabelle at the event earlier. I hope you don’t run into her."

When Celeste remained silent, Evelyn could do nothing more.

With Lillian Graves by her side, she made her way toward the entertainment zone.

As they reached the first-floor lobby, they noticed a crowd had gathered, their steps slowing as they watched the unfolding spectacle with keen interest.

How could I possibly miss this?

Without hesitation, Evelyn and Lillian rushed forward to get a closer look.

The scene was nothing short of dramatic. A young man knelt on the floor, clutching a woman’s leg desperately. Both appeared to be in their early twenties.

The man’s voice cracked with emotion. "Vivienne, I love you! I can’t live without you. If you reject me, I swear I won’t survive!"

Tears welled in the woman’s eyes. "Dominic, stop this! Everyone is watching!"

"Vivienne, I’m sorry! I only acted that way because I love you too much! Seeing you with that other man drove me insane!"

"Don’t twist things—you knew he was my professor! You always jump to conclusions… Forget it. We’re done. I don’t want to argue anymore. I—"

"I don’t want to be done!" His voice rose, raw with desperation. "Please, give me one more chance. I’m begging you!"

Vivienne exhaled sharply, frustration lacing her words. "You’ve done this before—acted irrationally jealous, humiliated me in front of everyone. My friends say it’s a psychological issue, something you can’t change. They told me to leave you. And I did give you another chance—but you turned violent again. I’m done."

"Those people don’t understand! As a woman, you don’t see what men are really thinking—but I do. I was just trying to protect you!"

"That’s ridiculous! I should’ve listened to them and never looked back."

"I was wrong, I swear! If you forgive me, I’ll do anything—anything! I’ll even punish myself!" With that, he began slapping his own face, the sharp cracks echoing through the lobby.

The crowd murmured in shock.

Vivienne hesitated—then, unable to bear it, she grabbed his wrists, her voice breaking. "Stop! This isn’t the issue!"

"I know you’re still upset about her—but I swear, there was nothing between us! I cut all contact!"

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Lillian. This is worse than I thought.

The tension thickened, the air charged with unresolved emotions—and the promise of even more drama to come.

"Yet my best friend swears she saw you two together again. She warned me you were playing me, begging me not to take you back."

The man's expression twisted. "Lies! Tell her to show proof! Didn't you say your friend's love life is a train wreck? She's just jealous of what we have."

"She’s not like that. Vivienne is kind, brilliant, and successful. Don’t you dare speak about her that way! Every time we fought, she was the one who took me in, who comforted me!"

"If she truly cared, why would she poison your mind? Yes, I lost my temper, but it was only because I love you madly. Can you deny that? Did she ever acknowledge my feelings for you? She just can’t stand seeing you happy!"

"It’s not… It’s not true!" Though she protested, uncertainty flickered in her eyes.

"After all these years together, you’d trust an outsider over me? Fine, maybe I’m flawed, but my heart has always been yours. We were perfect until she got involved. You used to adore me, but now everything I do is wrong. She’s the one twisting your thoughts, whispering lies until you believe them."

"No, she made valid points. You’re suffocating me. I can’t even choose my own clothes. Others noticed too—I was just blind to it," the woman murmured, her face torn.

"Those are petty details! I only wanted to protect you! And there’s something you don’t know—your friend has feelings for me!"

"Every time I visited, she’d watch me, pushing you to leave me. If that’s not obsession, what is? She’s desperate to break us apart. But I’d never want her—I made sure she knew it!" His voice dripped with false righteousness.

The woman staggered back as if struck.

"But she’s stunning… like a Hollywood star. Why wouldn’t you—"

"I’ll confront her. If she admits it, I’ll forgive you. But if she denies it… we’re done. I won’t let you break me again!" With a shove, she fled before he could react, his numb legs failing him.

"WHAT ARE YOU ALL GAPING AT? SCRAM!" he roared at the gawking crowd.

Evelyn Sinclair and Lillian Graves slipped away, exchanging glances.

"Evelyn, do you think they’ll reconcile?" Lillian nibbled her crepe.

"You believe that man’s act?" Lillian frowned. "He reeks of manipulation."

"Whether he lied or not, that woman’s hesitation says it all. Reconciliation is inevitable." Evelyn sighed. "If he’s telling the truth, fine. But if he’s lying? That poor friend of hers."

Lillian blinked. "Huh?"

Evelyn popped a candied fruit into her mouth. "Worst part? The woman blamed her friend, making her the villain. If they reconcile, that friend loses everything. That’s toxicity, Lillian. Remember: steer clear of people like that."

As Evelyn turned, she spotted Vivienne—the woman from the fight—entering a café. The glass walls revealed four scholars deep in discussion.

"Our project’s too avant-garde for local investors. Overseas funding might be our only hope."

"Even collaborating abroad, the professor insists we retain control. That’s why we’ve struggled to secure domestic backing."

A voice cut in abruptly. The trio stiffened, glancing at Celeste.

"Apologies, I spoke out of turn," the speaker backpedaled.

Celeste, sporting a sleek boyish haircut and black-rimmed glasses, merely smiled. "No harm. Let’s brainstorm alternatives."

Dressed in a crisp white blouse, she bore zero resemblance to her starlet twin, Isabelle.

"Mind if I join? Your research intrigues me. I’d like to invest."

A tall figure loomed over them—hat, sunglasses, black mask. He hooked a finger under the mask, revealing sculpted lips. "May I sit?"

The group gaped at Celeste.

Her ex-fiancé, superstar Julian Blackwood, was infamous among her peers. Rumors swirled that he’d been closer to Isabelle than to Celeste.

When Celeste returned, resolved to leave for research abroad, she’d coldly severed ties with her family and broken their engagement.

Now, here he was—disguised, offering investment?

Clearly, this was about Celeste.

The stoic researchers barely suppressed their gossipy glee.

The woman beside Celeste bolted to the opposite seat. The others clutched their coffees, mute.

Julian’s pulse raced at Celeste’s new look. Not his usual type, yet he’d never been more certain: he was utterly smitten.

"Celeste, I—" he stammered.

"Mr. Blackwood, celebrity status won’t cover the sums we need," Celeste said flatly, avoiding his gaze.

Julian recovered swiftly. "Quirk Group will back you. I’m here as their rep, not a star."

The team brightened. Quirk Group was an unexpected boon.

"Then discuss terms with our professor. Not us." Celeste turned to a colleague. "Escort him, please."

Julian panicked. "No, I need to talk to you!"

Celeste finally met his eyes—impatience flashing. The sting of her gaze nearly undid him.

Tears threatened. "Please. Just five minutes."

"Using money to pressure me? How original."

Julian paled. "I’ll go. The investment stands." Defeated, he rose.

Celeste froze. The Julian she knew never backed down. This meek surrender reminded her of the boy who’d once adored her.

Flustered, she gulped her coffee.

Julian lingered, then gasped—staring past the glass.

The group followed his gaze.

Two girls stood outside, laden with shopping bags. The breathtaking one stared straight at them, eyes wide with curiosity.

"Is she… Julian’s fan?" someone whispered.

Celeste locked eyes with Evelyn.

"That’s his sister-in-law."

###Chapter 29

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. The text from Nathan Blackwood had been brief but explosive: "We need to talk. Now." Her stomach twisted. After weeks of radio silence following their explosive argument at the gala, why was he reaching out now?

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered near the doorway. "Your 10 AM with Preston Whitmore is in thirty minutes. Should I cancel?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No. Whatever Nathan wants can wait." But even as she said it, her fingers itched to reply.

The Blackwood Enterprises lobby was all sleek glass and steel, but Evelyn barely noticed as she strode past the receptionist. Nathan's secretary, Victoria Hayes, stood abruptly from her desk, her crimson lips curling into a smirk. "Mr. Blackwood is in a meeting—"

"Move," Evelyn snapped, brushing past her.

She threw open the conference room doors without knocking. The room fell silent. Nathan sat at the head of the table, his dark eyes widening momentarily before his expression shuttered. Around him, executives gaped.

"A word," Evelyn demanded.

Nathan stood slowly, his tailored suit emphasizing his broad shoulders. "Everyone out."

As the room cleared, he crossed his arms. "You have five minutes."

Evelyn tossed a glossy tabloid onto the table. The headline screamed: "Blackwood's Secret Fiancée? Inside His Midnight Rendezvous with Socialite Seraphina Delacroix!" Below was a blurry photo of Nathan leaving a hotel with the stunning actress.

"Care to explain?" Her voice was ice.

Nathan didn't flinch. "Not that it's your business, but it was a charity event. Nothing more."

"Funny timing," she shot back. "Right after you swore you were done with games."

His jaw tightened. "This isn't about her. It's about us. You walked away, Evelyn. You don't get to interrogate me now."

The raw edge in his voice made her breath hitch. Before she could retort, her phone buzzed. Lillian's name flashed with a message: "URGENT. Check your email."

Evelyn swiped open the attachment—and froze. It was a scanned document, stamped CONFIDENTIAL. The heading made her blood run cold: Blackwood-Sinclair Merger: Termination Clause.

Her head snapped up. "You're backing out of our deal?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "I didn't send that."

"Then who—?"

A sharp laugh cut her off. Victoria leaned in the doorway, her manicured fingers tapping a tablet. "Oops. Looks like the cat's out of the bag."

Nathan's voice dropped dangerously. "What did you do?"

Victoria smirked. "Just moving things along. You two are terrible for each other." She sauntered forward, dropping another file on the table. "Besides, Evelyn has bigger problems."

Evelyn snatched it open. Inside were photos—her meeting with Sebastian Hart last week, the actor whose lawsuit threatened to derail her studio's latest film. The caption read: "Sinclair's Secret Pact: Sabotaging Blackwood's Investments?"

Nathan's gaze locked onto hers, stormy with betrayal. "Is this true?"

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears. This wasn't just a confrontation anymore.

Evelyn instructed Lillian to take the shopping bags back to the car while she slipped into the café to join the lively scene.

Three researchers lounged in plush chairs, sipping their drinks with eager anticipation, while across from them, Celeste, Evelyn, and Julian occupied a sleek bench. Evelyn didn’t hesitate to plant herself right in the middle—exactly where Celeste had subtly intended.

"Fancy meeting you here!" Evelyn chirped, her voice dripping with warmth. "Shopping really takes it out of me, so I popped in for a coffee. Imagine my surprise when I spotted you all!" Her playful grin lingered on Julian a beat too long, eyes twinkling with mischief.

Ah, the dramatic lengths one goes to win back an ex. Classic.

Julian’s jaw tightened as Evelyn’s inner monologue reached him.

Still, her interruption had given him a moment to collect himself before Celeste could dismiss him entirely, and for that, he was grudgingly grateful.

Celeste, ever the diplomat, greeted Evelyn warmly. "I didn’t realize you two came together?"

Evelyn waved a hand. "Oh, I texted you, but you must’ve missed it. I’m here representing Nathan’s agency as their newest artist. As for him?" She shot Julian a pointed look. "He refused to escort his dear sister-in-law, yet here he is. Suspicious, no?"

Her tone carried just enough playful accusation to make the three researchers exchange exaggerated glances. When Julian stayed silent, their curiosity only deepened. So he really did come for Celeste?

Celeste pretended not to catch the implication, pulling out her phone. "Ah, my bad. I had it on silent for meetings."

Then her expression shifted. Evelyn sipped her coffee, unfazed—she’d expected this.

Julian, despite his obstructed view, noticed immediately. "What’s wrong?"

Celeste’s brow furrowed as she glanced at Evelyn.

The latter chuckled lightly before leaning toward Julian, whispering just loud enough for everyone to hear: "Oh, nothing major. Just ran into Isabelle at the event. Thought I’d warn Celeste."

The café’s ambient chatter seemed to hush.

Julian’s face darkened. "I had no idea she’d be here. I blocked her everywhere."

Celeste’s gaze flicked away, indifferent. "That’s between you two. No need to explain."

Evelyn, ever the instigator, added fuel to the fire. "She was looking for you, but Marcus intercepted her. Want to handle it?"

Julian shot her a glare, already typing a message to Marcus. "Not necessary. He knows I won’t see her. He’ll make sure she leaves."

Wow, suddenly he’s a gentleman? Where was this energy before?

Julian stole glances at Celeste, but her expression remained unreadable. His chest ached.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s interest piqued as she probed about their meeting. I thought Julian was just being stubborn, but now he’s investing? Spending a fortune just to stay close to her?

Celeste, noticing Evelyn’s knowing look, cut in coolly, "Our project isn’t short-term profitable, and it doesn’t align with Blackwood Group’s interests. If Nathan’s truly interested, he can discuss it directly. No need to trouble Julian."

Evelyn shot Julian a sympathetic glance—only to find his face ashen.

Yikes. She’s not playing hard to get. She’s genuinely done.

Julian’s heart twisted further as Evelyn’s thoughts stabbed at him. Still, he wasn’t one to give up. Discreetly, he tugged Evelyn’s dress hem, eyes pleading.

What now? A sudden eye spasm?

Julian gritted his teeth. I need her help. Play along.

"If Nathan reviews your proposal, he’ll follow protocol," Julian interjected smoothly. "But if you let me assess it first, I can fast-track things. As a board member, I can cut through red tape. Time-sensitive, right?"

Celeste’s gaze flicked to Evelyn, seeking confirmation. "Is that true?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her chocolate. Oh, this is rich.

Julian, panicking, blurted, "Evelyn, your phone’s buzzing!"

She checked it—then blinked at the notification: Transfer: $500,000. Note: Stay out of it.

Half a million for this? Money really does grow on trees for him.

Julian exhaled in relief—until he heard her internal laughter.

Free money! Nathan and I are barely even married—how would I know their company policies? Julian’s such an easy mark!

Realization struck Julian like a slap. I panicked. Forgot they’re not actually close.

Meanwhile, in his office, Nathan suddenly felt his ears burn.

Celeste, uninterested in Julian’s motives, just wanted distance—but fate seemed determined to keep them entangled.

Desperate to keep her from involving the professor, Julian turned to the researchers. "I won’t understand the technical details anyway. But this overseas plan—how much funding do you need?"

At "overseas," Celeste visibly relaxed. Finally, an escape.

The trio obliged with vague answers.

Julian’s face fell. "So… the whole team’s relocating for at least five years?"

Try forever. She’s never coming back.

His eyes darkened with regret. This is my fault.

One researcher, misreading his despair, added, "But sometimes people change their minds!"

Celeste shot her a warning look.

Then she caught Julian’s devastated expression—and froze. Since when does he make faces like that?

But Julian, ever resilient, locked eyes with her, intensity burning.

Celeste’s breath hitched. This… this is the Julian I remember.

Just then, an excited voice cut through: "Wait—you’re Julian Blackwood?!"

He’d removed his sunglasses and mask for conversation, and now recognition dawned on the newcomer.

One researcher quickly hushed her. "Keep it down! He’s here on business!"

"But—it’s him!"

Julian offered a polite smile. "Hello."

Evelyn, finishing her dessert, nearly choked again. Unbelievable timing.

"Vivienne, why’s your face wet? Were you crying?" a researcher asked.

Vivienne didn’t respond, too starstruck.

Evelyn’s quiet snicker, however, caught Celeste’s attention.

What’s so funny?

###Chapter 30 
The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. Nathan Blackwood had been avoiding her calls for days, and the silence gnawed at her like an open wound.

"He wouldn’t just disappear without a word," she muttered, her nails digging into her palms.

A sharp knock at the door startled her. Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant, stood there with an unreadable expression. "Ms. Sinclair, you need to see this." She handed over a tablet, the screen displaying a breaking news headline:

"Billionaire Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Ex-Fiancée at Private Estate—Reconciliation Rumors Swirl."

Evelyn's breath hitched. The accompanying photo showed Nathan standing close to Cassandra, his first love, their bodies almost touching as they stepped into a secluded villa. The caption beneath mocked her: "Old flames rekindled?"

Her stomach twisted. This couldn’t be real.

Lillian hesitated before speaking. "There’s more. Victoria Hayes leaked this to the press. She’s been working behind the scenes to sabotage you."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Victoria, Nathan’s scheming secretary, had always resented her. But this? This was war.

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood family estate, Nathan stared at the same article in disgust. "This is bullshit," he growled, tossing his phone onto the desk.

His mother, Margaret, arched a brow. "Then why were you with Cassandra?"

Nathan exhaled sharply. "She ambushed me, claiming she had information about Evelyn’s past—something dangerous. I went to hear her out, but it was a setup."

Margaret’s lips thinned. "And now Evelyn thinks you’ve betrayed her."

Nathan’s jaw clenched. "I need to fix this before she does something reckless."

But as he reached for his car keys, his phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number:

"If you want the truth about Evelyn’s real identity, meet me at midnight. Alone."

The screen flashed with a single name: Vincent Holloway.

Back in her penthouse, Evelyn slammed her fist against the glass balcony railing. The city lights blurred as tears threatened to spill.

"I trusted him."

Her phone chimed. A video file from an anonymous sender. With trembling fingers, she pressed play.

The footage showed Nathan and Cassandra in what looked like a heated argument. Then, abruptly, Nathan grabbed Cassandra’s wrist—

"You’re lying. Evelyn would never—"

The video cut off.

Evelyn’s heart pounded. What wasn’t she seeing?

A new message popped up:

"The real game begins now. -V.H."

Her breath came in short gasps. Vincent Holloway, the notorious playboy with a vendetta against the Blackwoods, was pulling the strings.

And Evelyn? She was done playing the pawn.

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the penthouse, the scent of betrayal hit her like a slap. Perfume—expensive, cloying, unmistakably not hers—lingered in the air, clinging to the velvet drapes and the leather couch where Nathan Blackwood lounged, his tie loosened, his expression unreadable.

Her fingers curled into fists. "Who was here?"

Nathan didn’t flinch. "Victoria."

Victoria Hayes. His secretary. His problem.

Evelyn’s laugh was sharp enough to cut glass. "Of course. Did you two have a productive meeting?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "It wasn’t like that."

"Then what was it like?" She strode forward, heels sinking into the plush carpet. "Because from where I’m standing, it smells like desperation and bad decisions."

His gaze darkened. "You’re overreacting."

"Am I?" She snatched the half-empty wineglass from the coffee table—lipstick smeared on the rim, red, like a warning. "Then explain this."

Silence.

Nathan exhaled, running a hand through his hair. "She came to discuss the merger. That’s all."

"At midnight?" Evelyn’s voice cracked. "In our home?"

A muscle twitched in his cheek. "I didn’t invite her."

"But you didn’t send her away either." The accusation hung between them, thick and suffocating.

Nathan stood abruptly, closing the distance between them. His hands framed her face, warm and familiar, but she stiffened. "Evelyn," he murmured, "you’re the only one I want."

She wanted to believe him. God, she wanted to.

But trust, once broken, was a stain that never fully washed out.

Pulling away, she wiped her cheek where his thumb had brushed her skin. "Prove it."

His eyes flickered. "How?"

"Fire her."

Nathan went still. "You’re asking me to—"

"I’m telling you." Evelyn backed toward the door, her pulse roaring in her ears. "Until Victoria’s gone, don’t bother coming home."

The elevator doors slid shut between them, sealing his stunned expression behind cold metal.

Outside, rain began to fall, washing the city in shades of gray.

But some stains, Evelyn knew, ran too deep to fade.

"My face was a mess, so I stopped by the restroom here to freshen up first. That's why." Vivienne offered a vague explanation, still reeling from her unexpected encounter with an A-lister moments ago.

Celeste noticed the details immediately. The redness around Vivienne's eyes betrayed recent tears. Memories of past incidents flashing through her mind, Celeste asked with genuine concern, "Tell me the truth, Vivienne. Did he come after you again?"

Her words hung heavy in the air. The three researchers present turned toward Vivienne with expressions torn between worry and unease.

The two male colleagues frowned deeply, their faces darkening as if recalling unpleasant experiences of their own.

A chill ran down Vivienne's spine at Celeste's question. Her expression twisted with conflict before she finally spoke. "Celeste, you—"

Ugh. This filth is making me nauseous.

Julian, the only one who could hear Evelyn's internal commentary, shot her a puzzled glance at the abrupt and cryptic remark.

Meanwhile, Vivienne's defensive tone drew clear disapproval from Celeste and the others. The two men hesitated to speak up—after all, they'd been accused and even assaulted before. They knew better than to provoke another scene.

The female researcher, however, stepped forward. "Viv, did he chase you down and put on another dramatic act? Don't fall for it again. A man like that doesn’t deserve your kindness."

"But…" Vivienne lowered her head, her voice barely above a whisper. "We’ve been together for years. It’s not easy to just walk away. Maybe this time he really will change. He seemed different… more sincere."

Celeste’s frown deepened. "Vivienne, you know his behavior shows violent tendencies. He’s paranoid—hostile to anyone who even looks at you. If you give up your chance to study abroad for him, then honestly—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn suddenly gripped her wrist, cutting her off mid-sentence.

Celeste blinked in surprise. She didn’t even need to glance at Evelyn to feel the tension radiating from Vivienne across from her.

"Celeste, how dare you talk about Dominic like that? Do you expect me to see him as some kind of monster? I’ve known him since we were kids. I understand him better than anyone. What you’re saying… is just wrong."

Even though two people had spoken up, Vivienne directed her anger solely at Celeste. Julian didn’t need Evelyn’s silent commentary to react sharply.

"How can you say that? Celeste was only trying to help. Even if you disagree, you should at least have the decency to be civil."

The Blackwood family was fiercely protective, and Julian was no exception—Celeste had always been his Achilles’ heel.

He wouldn't tolerate anyone disrespecting her—not a single soul.

The sudden shift in his demeanor from warm and approachable to downright hostile sent chills down Vivienne's spine. She barely knew Julian Blackwood, and the intensity in his gaze made her tremble.

"N-no, I didn’t mean any harm," she stammered.

"Neither did Celeste."

Confusion flickered across Vivienne’s face, her lips parting slightly as if silently questioning his words.

"Why… why are you defending her? You don’t even know the full story," Vivienne argued, her voice laced with wounded pride.

But her words only deepened Julian’s irritation.

He wanted to snap back, If I don’t defend her, should I defend you instead? What kind of logic is that?

"I’m happy to do it. You’re—"

"Julian!"

Celeste’s sharp interruption cut him off. Though her tone was firm, the way she dropped the formal "Mr. Blackwood" and simply called his name sent an electric jolt through him. His entire body tingled, craving more. It had been so long since she’d spoken to him like this—so intimately.

Julian turned to her instantly, his expression softening into something dangerously close to devotion. Call me again. I’ll listen. I’ll do anything.

Evelyn, standing awkwardly between them, shuddered at the intensity of his reaction.

Celeste had only stopped him out of necessity. Vivienne was still part of their research team, and it wasn’t Julian’s place to reprimand her.

"Vivienne, we’re leaving for the international conference soon. You need to get your personal issues in order," Celeste said, exhaustion creeping into her voice. She’d given the same advice too many times. If not for Vivienne’s erratic behavior—her disheveled appearance, her tear-streaked face—Celeste wouldn’t have gotten involved at all.

And now, being blamed for it? That was the final straw.

Vivienne’s gaze wavered, still holding a trace of skepticism even as Celeste confirmed their upcoming trip.

"Forget it. Let’s not discuss my personal affairs anymore. I’m sorry for making everyone uncomfortable," Vivienne murmured, her voice barely audible.

The tension eased slightly. The group quickly shifted topics, filling the silence with forced chatter.

Only then did Vivienne dare to voice her curiosity. "So, Mr. Blackwood, you’re here to invest? Why would a celebrity like you consider—"

A heavy silence fell.

While the others had carefully avoided the subject, Evelyn, ever the blunt one, had no such reservations.

"First of all, I hate the word former," Julian said coldly. "Second, don’t stir trouble, Evelyn. Bringing this up will only upset her."

He couldn’t figure out Evelyn’s angle, so he shot her a warning look before discreetly texting her under the table. Behave, or no more funding for your projects.

Then it hit him.

Is Evelyn… targeting Vivienne?

When Vivienne first appeared in Celeste’s circle, Julian had already stepped back from her life. Her research colleagues, aware of the situation, had made sure never to mention him. So by some twisted coincidence, Vivienne remained clueless about the history between the two people in front of her.

Her eyes darted between them in disbelief. "You two… aren’t together?"

Julian’s expression twisted in disgust.

"I was once the prospective sister-in-law of Celeste’s family, and now I’m his actual sister-in-law," Evelyn clarified, smirking.

Vivienne’s face paled. Not only had Celeste’s ex-fiancé shown up, but he’d brought family to see her. Were they here to pressure her into something?

Uncomfortable, Celeste interjected, "We don’t have any ties anymore. He just happened to be passing by, overheard our discussion, and expressed interest in the project."

Julian shot her a wounded look but wisely kept his mouth shut.

Then Evelyn spoke again, her tone dripping with amusement. "That’s right. Julian couldn’t hold onto Celeste’s heart and got dumped. Now he’s reduced to accidentally running into her."

Everyone stared at her in shock.

Even if it was the truth, she hadn’t been this brutally honest earlier.

Julian was utterly bewildered. Huh? Though he didn’t find anything particularly scandalous about the situation, what was her deal? It almost seemed like she was deliberately flaunting something.

Despite Vivienne’s face turning ashen, Evelyn paid her no mind. Instead, she turned to the stunned Celeste with a dazzling smile. "Oh, you're such an accomplished female researcher—and so stunning, too. I wonder what kind of extraordinary man could ever catch your eye. He’d have to be far more handsome, capable, wealthier, and better-connected than Julian, don’t you think?"

An unexpected barrage of criticisms rained down on Julian.

Hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you doing?

The trio of researchers couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

"Absolutely. Celeste is exceptional. Countless men have pursued her, but she’s never given any of them the time of day."

Julian’s expression darkened instantly at the remark.

As for Celeste, she stared at Evelyn with a mixture of exasperation and confusion.

But Evelyn had already shifted her attention back to Vivienne, whose face was now a shifting canvas of fury and humiliation, as if she wished the ground would swallow her whole. "So, whatever nonsense your ex-boyfriend spewed earlier must be complete rubbish. Celeste wouldn’t spare a second glance at a superstar like my brother-in-law, let alone harbor some pathetic secret crush on him."

Her words struck like lightning, leaving everyone stunned—so much so that they questioned whether they’d heard correctly.

"What?" the researchers gasped in unison.

Who was accusing whom of having a secret crush?

Vivienne trembled with humiliation, her eyes welling up with unshed tears.

Celeste stared at Vivienne in disbelief.

As for Julian, his expression had turned thunderous.

How dare you even think of comparing your worthless ex to Celeste? The audacity to fantasize about her harboring feelings for him—and you were foolish enough to believe it, doubting Celeste’s genuine intentions to help you. Honestly, even zombies wouldn’t bother with hopeless romantics like you.

###Chapter 31

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. The text from Nathan Blackwood had arrived an hour ago—just three words that sent her pulse racing: We need to talk.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered near the doorway, concern etching her features. "You've been staring at that message since it came in. What aren't you telling me?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her manicured nails tapping against the phone's screen. "It's Nathan. He knows."

"Knows what?" Lillian's eyes widened. "About the contract with Holloway Media? Or—"

"Everything." Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper. "The non-compete clause, the hidden shares, even the... other arrangement with Vincent Holloway."

A beat of silence. Then Lillian swore under her breath. "How?"

"Victoria Hayes." The name tasted like poison. Nathan's scheming secretary had always been a thorn in Evelyn's side, but this? This was war. "She's been digging through my old files at Blackwood Holdings."

Downstairs, the intercom buzzed. Nathan's driver announcing his arrival.

Evelyn's reflection in the floor-to-ceiling windows showed a woman on the edge—flushed cheeks, wild curls escaping her updo, the emerald-green silk dress she'd chosen for battle clinging to her curves. She squared her shoulders. "Cancel my afternoon. And call Preston Whitmore—tell him the documentary deal is on hold."

"Evelyn—"

"No time." She snatched her clutch from the sofa. "If Nathan's here to confront me, I need leverage. Get me everything you can on Sophia Blackwood's pharmaceutical startup. Her husband's offshore accounts, the FDA violations, anything."

Lillian nodded, fingers already flying across her tablet. "And if he's not here to fight?"

Evelyn paused at the elevator, her smile razor-sharp. "Then he's here to negotiate. Either way..." The doors slid open, revealing the mirrored interior where her reflection multiplied into infinity. "...today changes everything."

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the dimly lit kitchen, her pulse spiked. Something was off. The air smelled faintly of bergamot and steel—Nathan Blackwood’s cologne, and something sharper. Blood?

Her fingers trembled as she yanked open the cutlery drawer. Empty.

Where was it?

The obsidian-handled dagger—her last gift from her late father—was gone.

A shadow shifted in the doorway. Nathan leaned against the frame, his emerald eyes glinting with something unreadable. "Looking for something?" His voice was velvet over gravel.

Evelyn’s nails bit into her palms. "You know exactly what."

He pushed off the doorframe, closing the distance between them in three strides. The heat of his body pressed against her back as he reached past her, his breath warm on her neck. "Maybe you misplaced it."

She whirled around, shoving him back. "Don’t play games with me, Blackwood. That blade is mine."

Nathan’s smirk faded. "It’s also the only weapon that can kill a Holloway." His gaze flicked to the fresh scar on her collarbone—courtesy of Vincent Holloway’s last ambush. "You think I’d let you walk into another trap unarmed?"

Evelyn’s laugh was brittle. "So you stole it to protect me? How noble." She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Or is this about control?"

A muscle jumped in his jaw. Before he could retort, Lillian Graves burst in, her tablet clutched to her chest. "We have a problem." She thrust the screen toward them. A security feed showed Vincent lounging in his penthouse—flipping Evelyn’s dagger between his fingers.

Nathan’s phone buzzed. A text from Marcus Donovan: "He’s calling for a trade. Evelyn for the blade."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Nathan’s grip on her wrist tightened. "You’re not going."

She wrenched free, snatching her car keys from the counter. "Watch me."

The door slammed behind her. Nathan’s roar of frustration shook the walls.

Somewhere across the city, Vincent Holloway smiled.

Evelyn had always been an observer of drama, never expecting to witness such a spectacle firsthand.

The Celeste she knew was resilient and courageous—a woman who battled her demons alone, striving to break free from every chain to carve out a new life.

Yet, the way others perceived and described her was entirely different.

Recalling the conversation between those two made Evelyn’s stomach churn with disgust.

She replayed the scene in her mind, her thoughts dripping with sarcasm as she mocked the absurdity of what she’d just witnessed. Though no one else could hear her silent derision,

Julian, standing beside her, grew increasingly tense. His glare at Vivienne could have burned holes through steel.

Nothing enraged him more than the thought of someone fantasizing about the woman he loved.

If Vivienne had been a man, Julian would have already thrown a punch.

“A misunderstanding?” the female researcher scoffed, disbelief lacing her tone. “How could Dominic even entertain such thoughts?”

She wasn’t defending Vivienne or questioning Evelyn—just struggling to process the sheer absurdity of the situation.

“He—he’s lying! I know he is!” Vivienne’s cheeks flushed crimson, her expression a mix of panic and guilt. Somewhere deep down, she still knew right from wrong.

Evelyn feigned shock. “Oh, so you knew all along. That explains it. When you were arguing downstairs, pretending to doubt Celeste while saying you’d ask her later, I thought you genuinely misunderstood her. That’s why I stepped in to clarify.” She smirked, sharp as a blade. “Glad to see you didn’t actually believe him.”

Her words were a deliberate grenade, lobbed without care for the explosion of awkwardness that followed.

The room fell silent, every pair of eyes locked on Vivienne in stunned disbelief.

Now, they remembered Vivienne’s earlier attitude toward Celeste, and their expressions darkened.

Compared to Dominic’s fabrications, what left them speechless was Vivienne’s own suspicions.

Vivienne hadn’t expected Evelyn to expose her like this. She stared at Evelyn, shock and venom warring in her gaze, as if Evelyn had personally betrayed her.

Celeste’s face had gone deathly pale. “You actually thought I would ever—”

She was too revolted to finish the sentence.

Vivienne couldn’t meet her eyes. Head bowed, she stammered, “I didn’t! I was just trying to calm him down.”

Celeste let out a sharp, humorless laugh. Words failed her.

A male researcher scoffed, "Just appeasing her? Shouldn't you have shut it down completely? Like how Celeste always shuts you down whenever you come crying about your ex? If you hadn’t dragged her into your messy love life, she wouldn’t even know Dominic existed!"

Another chimed in, voice dripping with sarcasm, "I’ve heard of wishful thinking, but this? Vivienne, does your ex-boyfriend need a reality check? Or do you?"

Vivienne’s eyes welled up, her lower lip trembling like a dam about to break.

"Dominic sounded so sure back then—I just—"

Julian cut her off with a derisive laugh. "Sure? I couldn’t get Celeste to glance my way even after groveling, and you think she’d pine for your washed-up ex? What’s his secret? Delusion in bulk?"

Evelyn nearly choked. Since when had Julian added his own fanfiction to the mix?

Celeste, who’d been seething moments ago, went rigid. The anger drained from her face, replaced by something far worse—panic.

"And you," Julian snarled, advancing on Vivienne, "ever heard the term ungrateful snake?"

How am I supposed to face anyone after this?

Celeste hadn’t even exposed half the truth yet. She’d held back to spare Vivienne’s dignity—proof that kindness did exist in this world. But some people trampled on it like dirt.

Yet the moment Vivienne opened her mouth again, bile rose in Celeste’s throat.

One researcher muttered, "This girl’s a walking red flag. Every fight with her ex, she trauma-dumps on the entire lab and her long-distance friends. Like she’s outsourcing her trash boyfriend’s emotional labor. Then she runs back to him, all lovey-dovey. Being her friend must be karma for war crimes."

Another hissed, "Damn right! She took ages in the bathroom earlier because she was texting some friend about ‘suspecting’ Celeste. Of course, the friend only heard Vivienne’s sob story and called Celeste a ‘homewrecking b*tch.’ Vivienne even replied with that fake-innocent ‘Really? 🥺’ emoji. I need a bleach shower."

The first one gasped. "Wait—the friend said if ‘someone like Celeste’ couldn’t steal Dominic, it proved Vivienne’s charm. And Vivienne sent back the blushing-smug emoji! Oh my god, she believes this crap? What kind of ego—"

"Then the friend said as long as Vivienne doesn’t dump Dominic, she’ll always be the ‘legal wife,’ and other girls are just ‘mistresses.’" A pause. "Mistresses?! They’re calling Celeste—"

A deafening CRACK silenced the room.

Evelyn jerked her head toward the sound. Julian had slammed his fist into the table, his expression murderous. His glare pinned Vivienne, who was mid-whimper, her face sheet-white.

"You—" Julian’s voice was pure venom.

"Julian!" Celeste snapped.

He froze like a Rottweiler yanked by its chain. His jaw worked, but no words came out—just a wounded, frustrated noise.

"She insulted you," he gritted out.

Celeste blinked. That… wasn’t why she’d stopped him.

"You’re causing a scene," she said flatly. "Want to trend on Twitter?"

True enough, half the café was already filming.

Evelyn squeezed Julian’s arm, signaling him to cool it. She didn’t fully get his outburst, but his protectiveness was clear.

Still, she agreed wholeheartedly with the term insult.

Some people didn’t deserve an ounce of respect.

###Chapter 32 

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake, her mind still foggy from the restless night. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood slept soundly, his strong arm draped protectively over her waist. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked—so unlike the ruthless CEO the world feared.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. A message from Lillian Graves, her assistant:

"Evelyn, urgent. The press has caught wind of your engagement. Victoria Hayes is behind the leak. She’s spinning it as a business arrangement, not love."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Victoria Hayes—Nathan’s scheming secretary—had been a thorn in her side since day one. The woman had made it clear she wanted Nathan for herself, and now she was weaponizing the media to undermine their relationship.

Nathan’s phone rang next, jolting him awake. He frowned at the caller ID—Marcus Donovan, his brother Julian’s agent.

“What?” Nathan growled, his voice rough with sleep.

Marcus’s frantic voice crackled through the speaker. "Nathan, turn on the news. Now."

Evelyn grabbed the remote, flipping to a gossip channel. A headline blared across the screen:

"Blackwood-Sinclair Engagement: A Calculated Merger or True Love?"

Beneath it, a grainy photo of them at a gala—Nathan’s hand resting possessively on Evelyn’s lower back. The caption insinuated their relationship was a PR stunt to boost Sinclair Media’s failing stocks.

Nathan’s grip on the phone tightened. “Who the hell leaked this?”

Marcus hesitated. "Rumors point to Victoria. But there’s more. Someone dug up old photos of you and Cassandra."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Cassandra—Nathan’s first love, the woman who had shattered his heart years ago.

The screen flashed to an image of a younger Nathan, his arms wrapped around a smiling Cassandra. The headline taunted:

"Blackwood’s Past Haunts Present: Is Evelyn Just a Replacement?"

Nathan swore, throwing the phone onto the bed. “This is sabotage.”

Evelyn forced a steadying breath. “We need damage control. Serena Whitmore can draft a statement—”

“No.” Nathan cut her off, his gaze darkening. “We’re not playing defense. We’re ending this.”

He snatched his phone back, dialing a number. When the line connected, his voice was ice.

“Victoria. My office. Now.”

Evelyn watched as he stormed into the walk-in closet, already barking orders to his legal team. She knew that tone—someone was about to pay.

But as she scrolled through the flood of notifications, one anonymous message stood out:

"You think you know him? Ask Nathan about the night Cassandra disappeared."

Her blood ran cold.

What secret was Nathan hiding?

And why did she feel like the real game had only just begun?

Evelyn smiled sweetly, seizing the moment to interject, "Julian just has a short fuse. I was there when it happened. You were caught off guard—anyone would freeze in that situation."

Vivienne blinked in surprise. She hadn’t expected Evelyn to defend her.

Her throat tightened, tears welling up.

Wasn’t she the one who started this? Did she suddenly grow a conscience?

But then Evelyn continued, her tone light but razor-sharp, "After all, anyone with half a brain and working eyes knows Celeste would never be interested in someone like that. She doesn’t have bizarre tastes—her standards are perfectly normal. If even A-list celebrities don’t meet her expectations, why would she ever look twice at some delusional, violent nobody? And she certainly doesn’t have a masochistic streak. If a man so much as raised his voice at her, she’d be halfway across the country by sundown. So, Vivienne, deep down, you know Celeste wouldn’t touch your ex with a ten-foot pole. Sure, they say birds of a feather flock together, but you and Dominic are fundamentally different. He gets off on imagining other men stealing his girlfriend, while you get off on imagining other women stealing your boyfriend. The problem lies with him. You? You’re perfectly fine."

Vivienne stood frozen, her face draining of color. Then, like a dam breaking, she burst into tears.

"Oh dear," Evelyn cooed, tilting her head. "Why the waterworks? Wasn’t I defending you? Or is your brain so waterlogged it’s leaking? Besides, if anyone should be crying, it’s Celeste! She tried to help, only to get dragged into your toxic little fantasy. Poor thing—completely innocent."

The research team exchanged bewildered glances. The two male researchers failed to stifle their snickers.

"Ms. Sinclair, you’re... brutally honest," the female researcher muttered, casting nervous glances around, hoping they wouldn’t draw a crowd.

Evelynn shrugged, all innocence. "Some truths need to be said outright. Bottling things up just festers. You’re all too close to say it. As an outsider, I don’t mind."

Dealing with people like Vivienne required a sledgehammer, not a scalpel. Private resolutions? Pointless. She had to shatter Vivienne’s self-righteous delusions, force her to confront the absurdity of her own narrative. No more excuses, no more imaginary rivals to prop up her crumbling ego.

Evelyn had no doubt Vivienne was exactly the type to spin such tales.

"Celeste," Evelyn suggested lightly, "maybe you should make your stance crystal clear. Just to be safe."

Celeste studied the sobbing Vivienne, her expression cool. Slowly, she said, "To avoid future misunderstandings, don’t ever mention you and Dominic in front of me again. The only emotion I have for your ex is disgust. Rest assured."

The words landed like a slap.

Something in Vivienne snapped. "Is this really necessary? Ganging up on me just because Dominic misunderstood? Just because I had doubts? Celeste is some high-society princess, but what am I? Trash? Is that why you’re all humiliating me like this?"

Her voice cracked. "Celeste, this was just a misunderstanding! We could’ve talked it out. Why drag outsiders into it? Why let them humiliate me? Aren’t we friends?"

"Not anymore." Celeste didn’t hesitate. Since her rebirth, she’d vowed to prioritize herself. No more compromises. "I don’t keep people who betray me close."

Vivienne’s face went blank. Then, with a choked sob, she turned and fled.

The others shifted uncomfortably.

"Vivienne crossed a line, but... we’re still a team. How do we move forward?" one researcher murmured.

"Is she irreplaceable in your project?" Julian cut in, icy.

"Not really. She’s just an assistant."

"Then cut her loose." His tone left no room for argument. "Keeping someone like that around is nothing but trouble."

The team wavered. They’d worked together for years.

But Julian had already decided. As the project’s primary investor, didn’t he have the final say?

No way was he letting that toxicity near Celeste again.

Ah, the perks of capitalism.

Too far to hear clearly, they caught Vivienne’s shrill voice: "Because of your stupidity, Celeste cut me off! How am I supposed to stay on the team now? They’re right—you’re obsessed! You want to isolate me, control me! We’re done!"

With that, she sprinted away, oblivious to their stares.

Julian’s jaw tightened. That look—like prey spotting a predator—sent him lunging forward, but Dominic bolted before he could reach him.

"Honestly, without Vivienne, we’d never have had to deal with him," someone grumbled as they entered the elevator.

"Which floor?" the button-pusher asked.

Celeste shot Julian a wary glance.

Guilt flickered in his chest. (He’d absolutely researched the hotel beforehand.) But he nodded, deadpan. "Seventeenth. Only floor with vacancies."

Evelyn hesitated when they turned to her—until Julian interjected, "Same for her."

A calculated move. If Evelyn played along, maybe Celeste wouldn’t reject him outright.

The team marveled at the coincidence.

Evelyn arched a brow but stayed silent.

Julian, fearing she’d expose him, whipped out his phone. "Marcus just texted. Your room had plumbing issues. They moved you to the seventeenth too." He shoved the screen in her face.

A bank notification glowed: $500,000 transferred.

Nathan had mentioned Evelyn’s weakness for money. This should guarantee her cooperation.

(What Nathan actually meant: Evelyn appreciated direct gestures. Cash was the simplest gratitude.)

Sure enough, Evelyn beamed. "What a coincidence! Seventeenth floor for me too. Since we’re all here, how about supper later?"

Julian exhaled—just as Evelyn’s sly chuckle sent chills down his spine.

What an easy mark! I was gonna say seventeenth anyway. Now I get to watch him grovel and a fat paycheck? Two birds, one stone.

Julian swallowed hard, tasting blood.

How could I forget? Evelyn Sinclair thrives on chaos.

The polished steel doors of the elevator slid shut with a soft chime, sealing Evelyn Sinclair inside the mirrored cubicle. Just as the mechanism engaged, a blur of movement caught her eye through the narrowing gap. Someone had sprinted across the marble lobby, their designer heels clicking frantically against the floor.

Victoria Hayes skidded to a halt mere inches from the closed elevator, her manicured fingers hovering over the call button. Through the narrow glass panel, Evelyn watched her rival's perfectly contoured face twist in frustration. The assistant's crimson lips moved soundlessly as she glared at the ascending numbers above the door.

Evelyn allowed herself a small, victorious smirk as she leaned against the elevator's handrail. The mirrored walls reflected her satisfaction from every angle - the way her emerald green dress hugged her curves, the subtle lift of her chin, the knowing glint in her hazel eyes. She'd timed her exit perfectly.

Victoria's reflection disappeared as the elevator passed the third floor. Evelyn's phone buzzed in her clutch - a message from Nathan Blackwood that simply read: "My office. Now." The commanding tone sent an involuntary shiver down her spine, though she'd never admit it.

The elevator continued its smooth ascent, each floor passing with a soft ding that echoed in the confined space. Evelyn adjusted the diamond pendant at her throat - a gift from Nathan that felt more like a collar some days. She could still see Victoria's furious expression burned into her memory. That woman had been gunning for her position since day one, but Evelyn Sinclair didn't rise to become Blackwood Industries' top executive by being an easy mark.

As the elevator approached the executive floor, Evelyn squared her shoulders. Whatever Nathan wanted, she was ready. The game was afoot, and she held all the best cards. The doors slid open to reveal the plush carpet of the executive suite, her stilettos sinking into the thick pile as she stepped forward with calculated confidence. Behind her, the elevator doors closed with finality, leaving Victoria Hayes stranded thirty-eight floors below where she belonged.

###Chapter 33 

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her coffee, the warmth barely touching the chill in her chest. Last night’s argument with Nathan Blackwood still echoed in her mind—his sharp words, the way his storm-gray eyes had darkened with frustration.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant: "Meeting with Preston Whitmore moved to 11 AM. He wants to discuss the script changes before lunch."

Evelyn sighed. The director had been relentless about tweaking her character’s arc, insisting on more "emotional depth." As if she hadn’t poured her soul into the role already.

Before she could reply, another notification flashed—Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary.

"Mr. Blackwood requests your presence at the office. Urgent."

Her grip tightened around the phone. Urgent? After the way he’d dismissed her concerns last night?

Nathan’s office was as immaculate as ever, the scent of leather and sandalwood lingering in the air. He stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn kept her voice cool, though her pulse betrayed her.

He turned, his gaze piercing. "We need to talk about the press leak."

Her stomach dropped. "What leak?"

"The one where someone told the media about our relationship." His jaw clenched. "Care to explain?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "You think I did this?"

"Who else would benefit from the publicity?"

The accusation stung. She stepped closer, her heels clicking against the marble. "If I wanted attention, Nathan, I wouldn’t have kept us a secret for months."

A flicker of doubt crossed his face, but Victoria chose that moment to stride in, her crimson lips curled in a smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, the board is waiting."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. Convenient timing.

Nathan exhaled sharply. "This isn’t over."

As he walked out, Victoria lingered, her voice a venomous whisper. "He’ll see through you eventually, darling."

Evelyn smiled sweetly. "Funny. I was about to say the same to you."

Outside, the city buzzed with life, but Evelyn barely noticed. Her phone rang—Serena Whitmore, her agent.

"Evelyn, turn on Channel 7. Now."

The screen flashed to a paparazzi shot of her and Nathan leaving a restaurant last week, the headline screaming:

"Blackwood’s New Muse: Is Love in the Script?"

Her stomach twisted. Someone had set her up.

And she had a very good guess who.

To avoid being discovered, Julian tapped into his acting skills, effortlessly boosting his charm by proposing a late-night gaming session and supper with two male researchers.

Celeste, of course, declined and retreated to her room alone.

The others exchanged knowing glances. It was obvious Julian was just looking for an excuse to spend more time with Celeste.

With the main leads gone, everyone else prepared to return to their own rooms.

Surprisingly, Julian actually intended to treat them all to supper.

The trio of researchers was taken aback and initially tried to politely refuse.

Julian insisted, "I should’ve treated you all to a meal a long time ago."

Years ago, he had failed in his duties as a fiancé, but now he wanted to make up for it by treating Celeste’s friends. Too little, too late.

With nowhere else to go, Evelyn couldn’t resist adding a sarcastic remark under her breath.

Julian’s smile stiffened at the thought.

The researchers felt awkward too. Celeste’s retreat to her room made it clear she wanted nothing to do with Julian personally. Though they thought the two were a perfect match, they respected boundaries and didn’t want to pressure her.

They could be kind, but they wouldn’t guilt-trip anyone.

Seeing their hesitation, Julian smoothly shifted the topic. "Actually, I wanted to get to know your team better—so I can invest wisely and pay attention to the finer details in the future."

Even if it was just an excuse, refusing now would risk offending their benefactor.

And so, swept up in the moment, they all ended up in the researchers’ room for supper.

Julian ordered an extravagant feast, instantly dissolving any lingering tension. He even indulged them with autographs and photos. Even if they weren’t fans, he was still a top-tier celebrity—posting about this would rack up insane likes on social media.

Before long, Julian contacted Marcus to arrange two rooms on the same floor.

Cleverly, he chose the one directly across from Celeste’s.

Marcus and Lillian arrived soon after, smoothly covering for him.

However, once Marcus pulled Julian aside for a private chat, it became clear the issue was Isabelle. Julian wanted nothing to do with her anymore.

With Julian’s stance now firm, Marcus loosened up and cut off all resources previously allocated to Isabelle.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Lillian enjoyed skewers together. Julian approached them and whispered, "Later, come with me to bring food to Celeste."

Is he using me as a buffer because he’s too scared to go alone?

Evelyn refused outright.

She had never considered playing matchmaker for Julian and Celeste.

Julian gritted his teeth. "I just transferred a million—freshly wired."

Evelyn stood her ground. "A deal’s a deal. This is a separate price."

Julian choked, staring at this shamelessly greedy woman who had just taken his money. She had conned him before—how could she have no guilt?

In the end, he had no choice but to transfer more.

He muttered, "If this keeps up, I’ll develop a reflex."

Every time he asked for help, he’d have to pay.

Evelyn smiled as she accepted the money.

As expected, he’s turning over a new leaf! But is he stupid? Anyone else here would be a better buffer for delivering food. Yet he chose me. Is this his way of giving me front-row seats to the drama? I’ve never met someone so eager to throw money around. Hah, my opinion of Julian is really improving.

Julian heard her inner monologue and felt numb. Why did I pick Evelyn? Did I actually consider her family ties?

The thought sent a chill down his spine.

Forget it. At least I’ll have company.

He carefully selected food for Celeste. Evelyn suggested, "The grilled eggplant is great."

"She doesn’t eat eggplant."

Evelyn blinked. "You still remember her preferences?"

"Yeah." Julian replied casually.

Evelyn was surprised. Given how distant he had been from Celeste before, she had assumed he only remembered things about Isabelle.

They reached Celeste’s door, and Julian knocked.

A moment later, Celeste’s cool voice came from inside. "Who is it?"

Julian answered, "It’s me and Evelyn. We brought you supper."

Silence.

Clearly, Celeste was hesitating. Finally, the door opened.

If Evelyn hadn’t exposed Vivienne and Dominic, Celeste would still be in the dark. She had wanted to thank Evelyn, but Julian’s constant presence had made it impossible. Now was her chance.

Evelyn continued, "When you first advised her to break up and she agreed but then went back, you should’ve realized she doesn’t take advice. Some people just want validation, not guidance. When you meet someone like that, step back. Respect their choices, or you’ll end up hurt because of them."

Julian was taken aback, even impressed by Evelyn’s sudden wisdom. Did gaining the ability to see through people enlighten her?

Celeste’s expression remained icy. "Thanks for the food. Goodnight."

She moved to close the door.

"Wait!" Julian instinctively reached out.

A muffled grunt escaped him as his hand got caught in the door.

Startled, Celeste released the handle.

But before she could shut it again, Julian had already braced his arm against the door, refusing to let her.

"Celeste, we need to talk!" His voice was urgent, his gaze intense.

Celeste felt suffocated under the weight of his presence. His aura pressed down on her, making her skin prickle with discomfort.

She frowned, meeting his eyes with frosty indifference—enough to unsettle him. Yet he stubbornly held his ground.

Oh, persistence won’t work on Celeste. How clueless.

Julian stiffened. How am I still hearing Evelyn’s thoughts? Didn’t she leave?

Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the neighboring door slightly ajar—multiple shadows visible through the gap.

They’re eavesdropping.

His face burned. He was used to respect, to pride—never humiliation. But now, he had no choice but to push forward. He couldn’t afford to lose this chance.

Just as he was about to speak, Evelyn’s commentary floated over.

This won’t work.

Julian nearly choked. I haven’t even started! Don’t jinx it!

Being humble isn’t enough to erase the past. Celeste is waiting for him to say the right thing—to end it properly. If he messes this up, he’s .

Julian paled as he took in Celeste’s icy expression. He knew it wouldn’t be easy—but he hadn’t expected it to feel nearly hopeless.

It was like a death row inmate’s final plea before sentencing. His throat tightened with nerves.

But he couldn’t back down. He still owed Celeste three sentences.

###Chapter 34 

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, casting dancing reflections across the marble floors. Evelyn Sinclair adjusted the silver mask perched on her face, her emerald gown whispering against her legs as she moved through the sea of masked guests.

Nathan Blackwood stood near the balcony, his dark suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His golden mask did little to hide the intensity of his gaze as it locked onto Evelyn. She felt the weight of his stare like a physical touch, sending a shiver down her spine.

Victoria Hayes, ever the viper in silk, slithered through the crowd, her crimson dress a deliberate contrast to Evelyn’s elegance. She leaned in close to Nathan, whispering something that made his jaw tighten.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists. Not tonight.

Serena Whitmore appeared at her side, her own mask a delicate lace. "You look stunning, darling. But you’re glaring daggers at Victoria. Careful—she thrives on attention."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "She’s playing games again."

Serena smirked. "Then play better."

Music swelled, a waltz beginning. Before Evelyn could react, Nathan was before her, his hand outstretched. "Dance with me."

It wasn’t a request.

The moment his fingers closed around hers, heat flared between them. They moved in perfect sync, his grip firm, her steps light. The world blurred around them, leaving only the two of them in their own private universe.

"You’re avoiding me," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

Her pulse stuttered. "You’re engaged."

His grip tightened. "Not by choice."

Victoria’s laughter cut through the moment like shattered glass. She stood with Marcus Donovan, Christopher’s agent, her smirk sharp enough to draw blood.

Evelyn pulled back slightly. "This isn’t the place."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "Then where is?"

Before she could answer, a crash echoed through the ballroom. Glasses shattered as a masked figure stumbled into the center of the dance floor—Sophia Blackwood, Nathan’s sister, her face pale, her dress torn.

"Someone help her!" Evelyn gasped, breaking free from Nathan’s hold.

But Sophia’s next words froze the room.

"He’s here."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

Nathan’s expression turned lethal. "Who?"

Sophia’s voice was barely a whisper.

"Daniel Prescott."

The name hung in the air like a death sentence.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Because Daniel Prescott wasn’t just Sophia’s husband.

He was the man who had disappeared—along with five million dollars—two years ago.

And if he was back…

Nothing would ever be the same.

With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Julian's gaze hardened with determination.

Celeste seemed to sense the shift in his demeanor and fell silent.

"What did you want to say?" she asked quietly.

Julian's voice was deep, weighted with emotion. "Thank you."

Celeste blinked, clearly taken aback. She hadn’t expected those to be his first words.

"I mean it," Julian continued. "Thank you for coming to find me that day. For carrying me out. You saved my life. I owe you everything."

Celeste hesitated, her resistance wavering. "I accept your gratitude, but honestly... I don’t remember any of it. So, you don’t owe me anything. It’s all in the past."

But I don’t want it to be in the past.

A sharp pang of pain shot through Julian’s chest, but he kept his voice steady. "A simple 'thank you' isn’t enough. If my investment in your project makes you uncomfortable, think of it as repayment. No strings attached."

Celeste exhaled slowly. The project was too important to let personal feelings interfere. Still, his words made it easier to accept.

Finally, she nodded. "Fine. Consider it settled."

Relief washed over Julian. "There’s something else. I need to apologize."

Celeste’s expression tightened. "You didn’t do anything wrong—not from your perspective, at least."

Sorrow flickered in Julian’s eyes. "I know my apology means nothing after the damage I caused. I don’t deserve your forgiveness. But what I regret most is breaking my promise to you when we were young. I should have stood by you. I should have believed in you. I failed you, Celeste. I’m so sorry."

An unreadable emotion flashed in Celeste’s gaze. She inhaled sharply, about to speak, but Julian beat her to it.

"And one last thing—I love you. Please, give me another chance. This time, I won’t let you down."

Celeste stiffened, her breath catching. When she turned to face him, her eyes locked onto his—and for the first time ever, she saw tears glistening in them.

Her heart stuttered. Julian never cried. Never.

"N-No, you don’t," she said, her voice shaky at first but steadying as she continued. "You think you love me because you regret what happened. But don’t drag me into this just to ease your guilt."

"I’m not—" Julian’s voice cracked.

Celeste admitted his confession had shaken her. Once, she would have given anything to hear those words. But not anymore.

She smiled faintly. "Even if you mean it, my answer is no. I don’t love you anymore, Julian. You’re incredible—you’ll find someone better. And when you do, I’ll be happy for you. As a childhood friend. Let it go."

With that, she turned and closed the door behind her.

Julian stood frozen in the hallway, his heart shattering.

Meanwhile, Evelyn shut the door and turned to find everyone looking grim.

Their disappointment was understandable—they’d expected drama, not heartbreak.

"I’ve never seen Julian like this," Marcus muttered, rubbing his temples. "This is bad. He’s not going to recover anytime soon."

"That’s Celeste for you," Vivienne, the female researcher, sighed. "Once she makes a decision, she never wavers."

An awkward silence settled over them. Once they confirmed Julian had retreated to his room, they dispersed.

Vivienne shared a room with Celeste. When she entered, she found Celeste sitting by the floor-to-ceiling window, lost in thought.

"You still care about him, don’t you?" Vivienne asked softly. "After loving him for so long, you can’t just stop overnight."

Celeste turned and smiled—but said nothing.

Vivienne quickly backtracked. "Forget I said anything. A woman like you? You’ll have suitors lining up overseas. You’ll find someone better."

Marcus, meanwhile, was debating whether to check on Julian. Evelyn had planned to take Lillian back to rest, but Marcus stopped her.

"Ms. Sinclair, he’s practically family, right? Aren’t you going to check on him? I’ve never dealt with a heartbroken Julian before. What if he drinks himself into a stupor? Or worse—what if he does something reckless?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You and your imagination."

Still, she decided to humor him. Fine. He’s a client, after all. If he does something stupid, I’ll call an ambulance.

Marcus had the key card. He knocked first, but when there was no answer, he let himself in.

Only after confirming everything was fine did Evelyn step inside.

Julian was hunched over his phone, fingers flying across the screen.

"Julian, what are you—?" Marcus edged closer, only to see him researching Celeste’s project, her destination country, and the institute she’d be working at.

Evelyn arched a brow. Well, well. He’s not giving up.

Julian barely registered their presence, his focus unshaken. His expression was calm, almost detached—as if nothing could deter him now.

Evelyn sighed inwardly. Too bad Celeste’s made up her mind. Unless he pulls off a miracle, it’s over. Some chances don’t come twice.

Then—

A tear fell. Then another. Julian’s breath hitched as his vision blurred.

Marcus’s eyes widened. "Uh, we’ll just... go now." I am not staying to watch my boss cry.

Evelyn was stunned. He was fine a second ago!

A man like Julian, reduced to tears?

Now that was a sight.

Later, as Evelyn settled into bed, her phone buzzed.

Nathan: Did you make it back to the hotel?

Evelyn: Yeah. Your brother’s here too. Came to win Celeste back—got rejected. Hard.

Normally, she wouldn’t chat with Nathan, but tonight’s drama was too juicy to keep to herself.

Nathan: Hm. Doubt he’ll give up.

Evelyn: He cried.

Silence. Then—

Nathan: ...He what?

Evelyn smirked. Marcus is worried, so he asked me to keep an eye out in case Julian does something stupid tonight.

Typical brotherly concern.

Amused, she transferred the day’s earnings to Nathan, then turned in for the night.

Lillian, wide awake, made Evelyn envious. Youth.

A soft knocking came from the neighboring room.

Evelyn frowned. Who’s visiting at this hour?

Her curiosity got the better of her. Instead of opening the door, she peeked through the crack.

Isabelle stood there, desperation in her eyes.

"You doubt me too?" Julian’s voice was icy. "Just looking at you makes me sick. After all your lies, the only thing I feel for you is disgust. Leave, or I’ll call security."

Isabelle hesitated. "Have you been drinking?"

"That’s none of your business."

"Do you love her now? Not me?"

"Yes."

In a swift motion, Isabelle yanked off her coat, revealing a sheer nightgown that clung to her curves.

"Then let me be her for tonight. Just hold me, Julian. Please."

Evelyn had to admit—Isabelle was scarily good at mimicking Celeste. Her voice, her mannerisms—perfect.

But the act only enraged Julian further.

His hands clenched into fists.

This wasn’t going to end well.

When Isabelle threw herself at Julian with open arms, he reacted instantly—shoving her away with such force she stumbled backward. "Stay the hell away from me!"

"Ouch!" Isabelle cried out, clutching her elbow where she'd hit the wall.

Julian wasn't the type to lay hands on women—except when pushed beyond all limits.

And right now? He'd reached his breaking point.

The scene naturally drew attention.

Within seconds, doors from the researchers' quarters flew open—only to slam shut again as their occupants caught sight of the unfolding drama. One female researcher had just opened Celeste's door when the sight of half-dressed Isabelle made her gasp. She immediately tried to retreat.

"Celeste! How could you?" Isabelle wailed dramatically, tears streaming down her face. "First you steal Julian's heart, now you're trying to seduce him into your bed? Have you no shame?"

Julian's fists clenched, ready to intervene—until a startled gasp echoed in his mind.

The sound—inaudible to anyone else—froze him mid-step. Whirling around, he spotted Evelyn peeking from behind a pillar, her wide eyes darting between him and Isabelle.

Before he could question her presence, her panicked thoughts flooded his consciousness:

Oh god! Isabelle has an STD! Vincent gave it to her! Please tell me Julian didn't—not after all this time! How do I even—thank heavens Celeste didn't—

Julian's blood ran cold. In his shock, he forgot these were merely Evelyn's unspoken fears. Meeting her horrified stare, then Celeste's confused expression across the hallway, he blurted out the words that would haunt him forever:

"I never touched her! For fuck's sake, I'm still a virgin!"

Dead silence swallowed the corridor.

###Chapter 35
The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her phone pressed tightly to her ear. "Victoria, I need those contracts reviewed by noon," she demanded, her voice sharp with urgency.

On the other end, Victoria Hayes sighed, flipping through the thick stack of papers on her desk. "I'm working on it, Evelyn. But these clauses are—"

"I don't care about the clauses," Evelyn interrupted, her fingers tightening around her phone. "Just get it done."

She ended the call abruptly, tossing the device onto the plush velvet couch. The weight of the upcoming merger pressed heavily on her shoulders, but failure wasn’t an option. Not when Nathan Blackwood was watching her every move.

Speaking of the devil…

Her phone buzzed again, Nathan’s name flashing on the screen. She hesitated for a fraction of a second before answering. "Nathan."

"Evelyn," his deep voice resonated through the line, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine. "We need to talk. In person."

Her grip on the phone tightened. "About?"

"The merger. And other things." There was an edge to his tone, something unreadable that made her pulse quicken.

"Fine. Your office in an hour."

"Make it thirty minutes." The line went dead before she could protest.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, running a hand through her dark waves. Nathan always had a way of throwing her off balance, and she hated it. Hated how his presence alone could unravel her carefully constructed composure.

She grabbed her blazer from the back of a chair, slipping it on as she headed for the door. The elevator ride down to the lobby was agonizingly slow, her mind racing with possibilities. What did he want to discuss? The merger was straightforward—at least, it should have been. But with Nathan, nothing was ever simple.

Her driver, Marcus, held the car door open as she slid into the backseat. "Blackwood Enterprises, please. And step on it."

The city blurred past the tinted windows as the car sped through the streets. Evelyn’s fingers drummed restlessly against her thigh, her thoughts a tangled mess.

When they arrived, she didn’t wait for Marcus to open her door. She strode into the sleek, glass-and-steel building, her heels clicking sharply against the polished floors. The receptionist barely had time to greet her before Evelyn was marching toward the private elevator, swiping her access card with practiced ease.

The doors slid open to reveal Nathan’s office—spacious, immaculate, and suffocatingly familiar. He stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad silhouette framed against the skyline.

"You’re early," he remarked without turning around.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Cut the small talk, Nathan. What’s this about?"

Finally, he faced her, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Sit down."

"I’d rather stand."

A flicker of amusement crossed his features before his expression hardened again. "Suit yourself." He moved to his desk, retrieving a folder and sliding it toward her. "Take a look."

Evelyn hesitated before stepping forward, flipping open the folder. Her breath caught as she scanned the contents—financial discrepancies, unauthorized transactions, all traced back to someone within her company.

Her head snapped up. "What is this?"

"Evidence," Nathan said coolly. "Someone’s sabotaging the merger from your side."

Her mind reeled. "That’s impossible. My team is vetted—"

"Everyone has a price, Evelyn." His voice was low, dangerous. "Even people you trust."

A cold knot formed in her stomach. If this was true…

She met his gaze, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "Who?"

Nathan’s lips curved into a humorless smile. "That’s what we’re going to find out."

The air between them crackled with tension, unspoken words hanging heavy. Evelyn knew one thing for certain—this was far from over.

And the real game had just begun.

The hallway froze into stunned silence. Whether peeking through cracked doors or shamelessly eavesdropping, every resident was rendered speechless by Julian Blackwood's outburst.

At first, the crowd dismissed it as a desperate lie—just Julian trying to salvage his dignity after Isabelle's brazen ambush. After all, how could someone like him, Hollywood's golden boy with a reputation for charm, still be... untouched? Even Celeste had assumed he and Isabelle had crossed that line ages ago. Their constant alone time had fueled enough rumors for her parents to gently suggest she "accept reality."

So when Julian blurted out that confession, credibility wasn't exactly on his side.

Realizing his slip, Julian's face burned crimson. He wanted the floor to swallow him whole. But Celeste's skeptical stare sent panic surging through him. This isn’t just about pride anymore—if she doesn’t believe me, she might think I’m hiding some... condition!

Dignity be damned. Ignoring Isabelle’s venomous glare from the floor, he lunged toward Celeste—only to trip spectacularly, skidding to his knees at her doorstep.

Celeste instinctively reached to help, but Julian seized her wrists before she could retreat. His gaze burned with frantic sincerity. "We were engaged back then! You think I’d betray you with her? I swear on my life, I’ve never—never—been with anyone! No diseases, no lies—just you! Believe me!"

The hallway collectively gaped. Holy hell. He’s kneeling while saying this. Either he’s Oscar-worthy, or... The image of Julian Blackwood, A-list heartthrob, being a virgin shattered every assumption.

No freaking way, Evelyn Sinclair thought, biting her lip to stifle laughter. Mr. "I-Date-Supermodels" is a virgin*? The tabloids would pay millions for this clip!*

Julian’s eye twitched at her mental cackling, but he couldn’t afford distractions. His grip on Celeste tightened, his voice raw. "I stayed faithful. To us."

Celeste, meanwhile, short-circuited. A man on his knees, swearing his... purity? Heat flooded her cheeks as she yanked her hands back. The absurdity was too much.

But Julian wasn’t done. "Test me. Anything," he rasped. "I’ll prove it."

Somewhere, a phone camera discreetly clicked. Tonight’s gossip just went nuclear.

Evelyn Sinclair, who had finally severed ties with their toxic relationship, couldn't take another second of it. She yanked her hand away and slammed the door shut behind her.

Her voice trembled with uncharacteristic panic. "T-That's none of my business!"

She bolted down the hallway, heart pounding.

Julian Blackwood rapped his knuckles against the door urgently. "But I'm serious! You have to believe me!"

"Julian Blackwood!" Isabelle shrieked, her eyes blazing with fury as she rounded on him. "Are you blind to anyone but that witch? Was everything we shared just a lie? You're utterly heartless!"

Julian finally turned to face her, his previously tender gaze icing over in an instant.

"Why did you come here tonight?" Suspicion laced his voice as he studied Isabelle's motives.

Isabelle stiffened, a flicker of guilt flashing across her features before she masked it.

So that's how it is! Watching the drama unfold, Evelyn seized the moment to dig up the scandalous truth.

Isabelle had been avoiding Vincent Holloway for weeks. But recently, she'd received devastating news—Vincent had contracted an STD. Panicked, she got tested and discovered she was infected. Blaming Julian for her predicament, she convinced herself that his constant rejection had driven her into Vincent's arms. In her twisted logic, if Julian had just loved her properly, none of this would have happened. Now that he was abandoning her, she was determined to drag him down with her. Pathetic.

Julian's expression darkened with cold rage. Cutting off any further excuses, he pulled out his phone and summoned Marcus Donovan to handle the situation.

Isabelle panicked. "So this is it? You'd really throw away everything we had? Even if I'm willing to be Celeste's replacement?"

Julian scoffed. "You could never measure up to her."

"But Celeste doesn't want you anymore!" Isabelle spat desperately. "You know how stubborn she is—she won't change her mind. At least with me, you'd have some comfort!"

Julian's voice turned glacial. "To me, you and Celeste have always been worlds apart—except for that one time I mistook her for you when I was dying. Don't degrade her just because you have no self-respect."

Isabelle trembled violently, not from fear, but from pure, seething hatred.

Marcus had shown her courtesy earlier for the sake of appearances, but now, her reckless behavior infuriated him. What if someone had snapped photos?

Surprisingly, Isabelle didn’t resist as Marcus escorted her away. But the venomous glare she shot over her shoulder made it clear—this wasn’t over.

Julian frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Evelyn groaned. "You should’ve told me sooner. I already posted it in the group chat."

Julian paled. "What group chat?"

"Um… the Blackwood family group."

His momentary relief vanished. Great. Now my whole family witnessed that train wreck.

He checked his phone frantically but found no messages in the main family chat.

"It’s… a smaller group I made," she admitted sheepishly.

Before bed, Nathan Blackwood hadn’t been the only one to reach out. Margaret, Richard, and Sophia had all—

Evelyn's phone buzzed incessantly as her concerned friends checked on her for staying out alone. Each notification carried the same worried question: Are you okay?

Replying individually felt exhausting. With a mischievous grin, she created a group chat—The Inner Circle—and typed a single message to address them all. Then, unable to resist, she dropped the explosive gossip she hadn’t shared with Nathan.

Richard, Margaret, and Sophia’s reactions were priceless. Evelyn smirked, promising to update them the moment she got fresh intel.

Killing two birds with one stone—gossip and peace of mind. Who could sleep with this kind of tea left unsipped?

Julian glanced at Evelyn just as she sheepishly turned her phone toward him. "Too late," she admitted. "They’ve all seen it. No take-backs." She shrugged. "Didn’t expect them to be night owls…"

The chat log was minimal but devastating. At the top was Evelyn’s video upload, captioned:

HOT GOSS ALERT! A-list heartthrob caught on his knees outside his fiancée’s door at midnight, screaming he’s a—

The video had already been viewed.

Below it, Richard, Margaret, and Sophia’s responses were a chaotic flood of:

!!!
WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. HELL.
Evelyn Sinclair, EXPLAIN. NOW.

The dark screen of Julian’s phone reflected his handsome face—now twisted in horrified disbelief.

###Chapter 36

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of a thousand crystal chandeliers. Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her emerald-green mask, her heart pounding as she scanned the sea of masked guests. The masquerade was in full swing—an event orchestrated by Nathan Blackwood himself, though his motives remained as enigmatic as the half-hidden faces around her.

"Enjoying the spectacle?" A deep voice murmured near her ear.

Evelyn turned to find Nathan standing beside her, his black tuxedo accentuating his broad shoulders, his own mask a sleek silver that only heightened the intensity of his gaze.

"It’s... overwhelming," she admitted, her fingers tightening around her champagne flute.

Nathan smirked. "Then you haven’t seen the best part yet."

Before she could question him, the orchestra’s melody shifted—a haunting waltz that sent a shiver down her spine. Nathan extended his hand. "Dance with me."

It wasn’t a request.

Evelyn hesitated, but the challenge in his eyes was irresistible. She placed her hand in his, and in an instant, he pulled her onto the dance floor. The room blurred around them as he guided her effortlessly, his grip firm yet gentle.

"You’re full of surprises, Mr. Blackwood," she murmured, struggling to keep up with his commanding presence.

His lips curved. "And you, Miss Sinclair, are far too cautious for your own good."

The music swelled, and suddenly, Nathan spun her into a dip so low her breath caught. The crowd erupted in applause, but Evelyn barely noticed—her entire world narrowed to the heat of his body against hers and the unspoken promise in his eyes.

When he pulled her upright, she barely had time to steady herself before a familiar voice cut through the moment.

"Ah, there you are."

Victoria Hayes materialized beside them, her crimson gown and gold mask making her look every bit the predator she was. Her smile was sharp as she addressed Nathan. "Your mother is looking for you. Something about urgent family matters."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t release Evelyn’s hand. "Tell her I’ll be there shortly."

Victoria’s gaze flicked to Evelyn, her smirk widening. "Of course. Though I doubt she’ll appreciate being kept waiting... again."

The barb struck true. Nathan exhaled sharply before reluctantly letting go. "Don’t wander too far," he murmured to Evelyn before striding away.

Left alone with Victoria, Evelyn braced herself.

"Charming, isn’t he?" Victoria purred, swirling her wine. "But then, you already knew that."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "Is there something you wanted?"

Victoria leaned in, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Just a friendly warning. The Blackwoods play for keeps. And you, darling, are way out of your league."

Before Evelyn could retort, Victoria vanished into the crowd, leaving behind the faintest trace of her expensive perfume—and a gnawing sense of unease.

Evelyn exhaled, her fingers curling into fists. She wouldn’t be intimidated. Not by Victoria, not by the Blackwoods, and certainly not by whatever game Nathan was playing.

But as the music swelled once more, she couldn’t shake the feeling that the real masquerade had only just begun.

I never imagined Evelyn would be so skilled at managing social media accounts to spread gossip. Julian was utterly devastated.

Evelyn offered a sheepish smile. "I'm sorry! We're all family here, and they're just concerned about your situation with Celeste. Besides, think about it—if you and Celeste do end up together, this video might become a treasured keepsake."

Wow. Just wonderful. Julian was speechless.

Even though I know they won’t last, I’ll just tell a little white lie to get myself out of this mess.

Julian was furious. Damn it! She’s not even sorry!

"Right, about Isabelle..." Evelyn noticed Julian’s dark expression and quickly changed the subject. How do I explain this? It’s life or death. But how do I justify where I got this information?

Julian shot her an irritated glance but gave her an out. "There’s something off about Isabelle. Marcus just warned me to stay away from her in case she does something reckless."

He kept his thoughts to himself. Neither Marcus nor Evelyn would suspect anything.

Evelyn was surprised they already knew. A weight lifted off her shoulders.

She grinned. "Thank goodness you managed to... ahem... dodge a bullet."

"Go to sleep!" Julian’s face darkened. The sight of Evelyn irritated him so much he wanted her to vanish.

Evelyn shrugged. Why is he so mad? Is being a virgin really that embarrassing? Both he and his brother are virgins. Nathan doesn’t seem ashamed. Oh, I see—it’s a family trait.

Julian stared at her, bewildered.

Did I hear that right? Did she just expose us? So that incident back then was fake? Wait—that’s not the point! The point is, Nathan’s a virgin too! Those exclamation marks in the group chat weren’t just about me?!

He felt a strange comfort knowing he wasn’t alone. At least Nathan was in the same boat. That was the only silver lining of that night.

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood estate, Nathan, who had just  work, suddenly felt uneasy.

Then, he heard faint whispers in the usually silent mansion.

Is everyone awake at this hour?

Puzzled, he checked his phone before bed and found a video forwarded by his mother.

Curious, he clicked on it—and was rendered speechless.

By the time Julian, exhausted, returned to his room, Nathan called.

Julian suspected Nathan had seen the video, hence the late-night call.

He might be embarrassed in front of others, but not his brother, who was in the same predicament. Hah! He’s been a virgin longer than me, and he’s married!

Driven by smug satisfaction, Julian answered confidently.

Nathan had called to check on him, only to be met with complaints.

"Did you watch the video?"

"Yes."

"Nathan, your wife humiliated me."

"You sound fine to me."

"You’ve changed. Are we even brothers anymore?"

Nathan was speechless, wondering when his brother had become so dramatic after spending time with Evelyn.

"Wait—you are my brother. Evelyn just mentioned we’re both virgins, and it’s a family thing."

Nathan’s eye twitched. He was tempted to hang up. "I’m ending this call."

"Wait! I have something important to discuss." Julian dropped the virginity talk and seized the chance to bring up the investment.

"Evelyn mentioned it to me. How about this—I’ll pick you up tomorrow, and we’ll sort it out."

"No need. I can handle it."

"This is a completely new venture for Blackwood Group."

Julian panicked. "I’m serious! If you show up, you’ll steal my thunder. I wanted to impress Celeste with this!"

Nathan paused. "You can’t threaten her."

"Do I look stupid? Of course not!"

"So, you’re really not giving up?"

Nathan sighed as Julian’s dramatic voice crackled through the phone.

The next morning, Julian shamelessly arranged a meeting with the professor, acting as if nothing had happened. They agreed to meet at the hotel’s breakfast buffet.

So much happened yesterday. Celeste could’ve avoided me, been disgusted, or embarrassed—anything to show she still cares.

Deep down, he knew Evelyn was right. As blunt as she was, she spoke the truth. The chances of him and Celeste being together were slim.

But he’d rather live in denial. Just seeing her one more time was enough.

Meanwhile, Lillian, indulging in the lavish buffet, spotted them. A gossip enthusiast, she immediately texted Evelyn, who was still asleep:

Saw Mr. Julian and Ms. Cowell.

Evelyn jolted awake. Which Cowell?

Lillian: The gorgeous researcher.

Evelyn mentally facepalmed. Obviously not Isabelle. She quickly freshened up, eager to witness the drama firsthand. Save me a seat. I’m coming.

Lillian: They’re almost done eating.

No reply. Lillian kept watch, phone in hand.

After finalizing the investment, the professor hurried off to prepare the report, and the group prepared to leave.

Lillian texted Evelyn again.

Moments later, Evelyn called, panting.

"Stop them! It’s dangerous!" she shouted.

Lillian froze, then bolted toward the exit. But the hotel was massive—she had no idea which way they’d gone.

Evelyn dashed out of the elevator, face pale. She spotted them heading toward the lobby.

Just as she relaxed, a dark figure lunged at them from behind.

Evelyn couldn’t see who it was. "Celeste, behind you!" she screamed.

Everyone turned—but only Julian reacted fast enough, throwing himself in front of Celeste.
###Chapter 37 

The penthouse was eerily silent, save for the rhythmic ticking of the antique grandfather clock. Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her reflection ghostly against the glittering cityscape. The storm outside mirrored the tempest in her chest.

Nathan Blackwood had lied to her.

Not just a white lie—no, this was a betrayal carved from deception. The documents Victoria Hayes had slipped into her hands hours earlier burned like acid in her mind. Blackwood Holdings' offshore accounts. Hidden transactions. A secret deal with Vincent Holloway.

Her fingers curled into fists. How many nights had she spent wrapped in his arms, oblivious to the empire he’d built on shadows?

The elevator dinged.

She didn’t turn. She didn’t need to. The shift in the air—the faint cedar-and-whiskey scent—told her he was here.

"Evelyn." Nathan’s voice was rough, edged with exhaustion.

"Did you think I’d never find out?" Her laugh was brittle. "Or did you just not care?"

A beat of silence. Then, the rustle of fabric as he stepped closer. "It’s not what you think."

"Really?" She whirled around, thrusting the papers at him. "Then explain this."

His jaw tightened as he scanned the pages. For the first time since she’d met him, the unflappable Nathan Blackwood looked... unsettled.

"It’s a contingency," he said finally.

"A contingency?" Her voice cracked. "You funneled millions into shell companies while telling me we were rebuilding your family’s legacy together!"

The clock ticked louder.

Nathan exhaled sharply. "There are threats you don’t know about—"

"Stop." She held up a hand, her wedding band glinting under the chandelier. "I’m done with half-truths. Either you show me everything, or I walk."

His eyes darkened. "You wouldn’t."

"Try me."

A muscle twitched in his cheek. For a heartbeat, she thought he’d call her bluff.

Then—

The door burst open.

Lillian Graves stood panting in the doorway, her tablet clutched like a lifeline. "Evel—Mrs. Blackwood—you need to see this."

On the screen: a live news feed.

Breaking: Explosion at Blackwood Tech’s R&D facility. Casualties expected.

Evelyn’s blood turned to ice.

Nathan’s phone rang. Julian’s name flashed across the screen.

As he answered, his brother’s voice was barely recognizable: "They’re coming for us all."

Time froze as Julian realized there was no chance to turn back. In that split second, his only thought was to shield Celeste from danger. His broad frame became her armor.

The knife meant for Celeste sliced through Julian’s shoulder instead.

Blood bloomed across his pristine white shirt, staining it scarlet.

Celeste spun around just in time to see Julian sway dangerously, his face paling.

Her breath hitched. "Julian!"

Screams erupted through the hall.

Two male researchers snapped out of their shock and lunged at the attacker, wrestling the knife from his grip.

"Dominic! Have you lost your damn mind?" A female researcher clutched the trembling professor, her voice shaking.

"You ruined everything!" The hooded figure—Vivienne’s ex-boyfriend, Dominic—glared at Celeste with wild eyes. "If it weren’t for you, Vivienne wouldn’t have left me! You poisoned her against me!"

He thrashed against the men restraining him, spitting venom. "I’ll make you pay!"

Security guards stormed in, led by Lillian, who had raised the alarm. Dominic fought like a caged animal, slashing wildly, but the guards forced him back, away from the crowd.

Julian collapsed to his knees, his strength draining with every drop of blood.

Celeste’s hands trembled as she pressed down on his wound, her mind flashing back to another boy, years ago, bleeding out in the dirt. Her voice cracked. "Someone call an ambulance—now!"

The hotel manager, sweating profusely, rushed over. "Our medical team is on the way. They’re highly trained—they’ll stabilize him." He radioed for backup, his words frantic.

The crowd buzzed with nervous energy, murmurs overlapping.

"Thank God it missed his artery."

"It’s deep, but not life-threatening."

Celeste barely heard them. Her world narrowed to Julian’s labored breathing, the warmth of his blood seeping through her fingers.

And the terrifying thought: What if I lose him too?

Celeste's hands trembled violently despite her desperate attempts to steady them. Naturally, Julian, whose wound she was dressing, could feel every shudder.

His lips had paled, yet he managed a weak smile. "It's alright. I'll be fine."

"You..." Celeste bit her lip, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "This is all my fault. If I hadn't interfered—"

The others exchanged uneasy glances. What terrible luck to be caught in such a disaster.

Julian clumsily patted her shoulder with his uninjured hand. "None of this is your doing. They were the ones who crossed the line."

Evelyn approached, her brow furrowed in concern.

At the sight of her, Julian immediately spoke up, his voice hoarse but sincere. "Evelyn, I owe you. Thank you."

This time, his gratitude was genuine. If not for Evelyn's sharp warning, that blade would have taken Celeste's life. The mere thought sent a chill down his spine. He wasn't sure how he'd survive if anything happened to her.

It was in that critical moment that he realized—Celeste meant more to him than his own life.

Celeste snapped out of her daze, her gaze softening with gratitude as she looked at Evelyn. The others murmured in relief, their tension easing slightly.

But Evelyn remained silent, her expression distant, her thoughts clearly elsewhere.

Julian assumed she was shaken and opened his mouth to reassure her—until he caught the fragmented whispers of her inner turmoil.

This doesn’t make sense. Why is it Dominic?

Julian frowned in confusion.

I saw Isabelle lying in wait in the hall, syringe in hand, ready to infect Celeste with that disease. That’s why I rushed down to stop her.

The revelation sent a jolt of alarm through him.

When Evelyn had woken earlier, curiosity had driven her to check Isabelle’s fate now that Marcus knew about her condition. She’d pulled up the system to see.

If Dominic’s sudden appearance was unexpected… then Isabelle must still be lurking somewhere, waiting to strike.

Julian’s expression darkened in an instant. Instinctively, he grabbed Celeste’s wrist—

Celeste, assuming he was in pain, didn’t pull away. "What’s wrong?" she asked anxiously.

It was the exact direction Dominic had fled. The crowd tensed as a woman’s scream pierced the air.

Evelyn hesitated. She didn’t dare involve herself in something so dangerous—not when she still had to watch for Isabelle’s ambush.

Despite the dizziness from blood loss, Julian forced himself to stay alert, his gaze scanning their surroundings.

"What happened?" Julian demanded. "Did he escape?"

As he spoke, the manager turned to Celeste with a hesitant expression. "If I’m not mistaken… you must be related to Ms. Isabelle, correct?"

Though it wasn’t their place to pry, the resemblance between Isabelle and Celeste was uncanny.

Julian’s grip tightened. "You saw Isabelle?"

Evelyn stiffened and quickly checked the system again.

Oh god. How do I even explain this…

Julian heard the thought and grew even more confused.

The researcher finally blurted out, stunned, "Isabelle was attacked by Dominic. When we got there, he was still screaming… He mistook her for you in his madness. So…"

Karma, I suppose. Evelyn’s thoughts were grim. Isabelle used Celeste’s identity without care for the consequences. Now, she’s paid the price by being mistaken for her.

Everyone who heard the news stood frozen in shock.

The manager's voice was urgent as he spoke. "Ms. Isabelle has sustained severe injuries and requires immediate hospitalization. Ms. Celeste, would you accompany her?"

Celeste hesitated, her expression clouded with conflict. After a brief pause, she steeled herself and rose from her seat, ready to follow the manager.

"Don’t interfere." Julian’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. "You’re no longer tied to the Cowell family. Stay out of it." There was no way he would let Celeste walk into that viper’s nest again.

Besides, who knew how Edward and Penelope would react once they discovered the reason behind Isabelle’s attack?

Julian tightened his grip on Celeste’s wrist and tossed the manager a slip of paper with a phone number. "Contact her parents directly."

Under Julian’s icy glare, the manager had no choice but to dial the number, though his hands trembled slightly.

Celeste exhaled quietly in relief. The last thing she wanted was to be dragged back into that family’s chaos.

Just as the manager turned to leave after reaching Isabelle’s parents, Julian’s voice rang out again, sharp and deliberate. "Warn your medical team. Isabelle is carrying a highly contagious disease."

The name of the disease dropped like a bomb, plunging the entire hall into stunned silence.

Gasps and murmurs erupted. No one could believe Julian had just exposed such a private, damning secret in public.

A cold smirk curled Julian’s lips. Why should I protect her? After what she had planned, she deserved no mercy. And he sure as hell wasn’t going to let her recklessness endanger the medical staff.

###Chapter 38

The penthouse was eerily silent as Evelyn Sinclair paced the marble floors, her stiletto heels clicking like a ticking time bomb. Outside, Manhattan glittered beneath a stormy sky, the city lights flickering like distant warnings. She clutched her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.

Nathan Blackwood's last text burned in her mind: "We need to talk. It's about Cassandra."

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered near the bar cart, pouring two fingers of bourbon. "You should sit down," she murmured, pushing the glass toward Evelyn. "Whatever it is, you'll handle it. You always do."

Evelyn downed the amber liquid in one swallow, the burn doing nothing to quell the icy dread pooling in her stomach. Cassandra—Nathan's childhood sweetheart, the ghost who'd haunted their relationship from the start.

The elevator dinged.

Nathan stepped out, his usually impeccable suit rumpled, his dark hair windswept. Raindrops glistened on his trench coat like shattered diamonds. His storm-gray eyes locked onto hers, and in that moment, Evelyn knew.

"It wasn't just a crush," he said hoarsely, running a hand through his hair. "We had a child."

The glass slipped from Evelyn's fingers, shattering on the floor like her carefully constructed world.

Across town, Victoria Hayes smirked as she scrolled through the encrypted photos on her tablet—grainy but unmistakable. A younger Nathan, his arm around a smiling Cassandra, a toddler with Nathan's eyes between them.

"Perfect," she purred, forwarding the files to an anonymous blog. "Let's see how perfect Evelyn Sinclair's life really is."

Meanwhile, in a quiet brownstone, Cassandra Whitmore tucked a sleeping boy into bed, brushing curls from his forehead. The same curls Nathan used to have. She jumped when her doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, Serena Whitmore's furious face filled her vision. "You had one job," Serena hissed as Cassandra opened the door. "Stay hidden. Stay gone."

Cassandra's hands trembled. "He found out, didn't he?"

Serena's silence was answer enough.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn finally found her voice. "How old?" she whispered.

"Seven," Nathan admitted, shoulders slumping. "I didn't know until today. My mother—"

"Margaret knew?" Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Of course she did."

Nathan reached for her, but she stepped back, the movement sending a crystal vase crashing to the floor. The sound echoed like a gunshot.

Outside, lightning split the sky. The storm had arrived.

And so had the paparazzi—flashing cameras illuminating the building like strobe lights as Victoria's leak went viral.

Evelyn watched her reflection fracture in the rain-streaked windows. The perfect actress. The perfect fiancée. The perfect lie.

Somewhere in the chaos, her phone buzzed. An unknown number. A single photo attachment: Nathan holding the boy's hand outside a school, his smile brighter than she'd ever seen.

The caption: "Meet your replacement."

Evelyn's vision blurred. The game had changed.

And she? She was done playing by the rules.

Celeste stood frozen, her lips parting in shock. "That's impossible!"

"She got it from Vincent," Julian revealed, his expression darkening instantly. "I only just found out, but everything I told you last night was true. If you don't believe me, I'll take the test right now."

Celeste's shock melted into mortification.

At that moment, the lab manager seemed to recall something crucial. His face paled, and he hurried away without another word.

The other researchers exchanged glances as realization struck. "Wait—so that syringe she was holding… That wasn’t just any liquid, was it? It was blood! She was planning to—"

Their horrified gazes snapped to Julian.

Her target was Julian last night, but now it’s Celeste? Evelyn thought, shaking her head. This woman is completely unhinged.

Julian scoffed. "Who knows what she’s capable of? From now on, none of us should let our guard down around her."

Celeste remained dazed, struggling to process how things had spiraled so far out of control.

Since this was a deliberate assault case, they were all required to stay for police questioning before being allowed to leave.

Julian’s wound was deep enough to require stitches, so he was rushed to the hospital, accompanied by Marcus.

When Evelyn stepped out of the police station, her eyes landed on a tall, imposing figure leaning against a sleek black sedan. The man wore a tailored charcoal overcoat, the crisp lines of a black suit visible beneath it.

Every inch of him exuded precision—his posture rigid, his gaze sharp under thick lashes as he watched the station’s entrance with unwavering focus.

Though Evelyn didn’t harbor romantic feelings for Nathan, she couldn’t deny the immediate sense of safety his presence brought.

She quickened her pace toward him—but he was already closing the distance between them. His long strides ate up the pavement, and within seconds, he was in front of her, scanning her from head to toe.

"Are you hurt?" His voice was low, edged with concern.

Evelyn shook her head. "Not a scratch. What are you doing here? I thought Marcus arranged for a lawyer to handle everything. Once Julian’s stitched up, he can be discharged. Didn’t Marcus tell you?"

Nathan’s shoulders relaxed slightly when he confirmed she was unharmed. "I couldn’t reach him. He’s still under anesthesia."

"Should we head to the hospital now?" Evelyn asked.

Nathan gave a single, firm nod.

Evelyn called out to Lillian and spotted Celeste striding toward them. The latter turned to Nathan and said, "I'm sorry. Julian got hurt because of me..."

"I already know what happened. It wasn't your fault," Nathan replied in his usual composed tone. "Protecting others is his responsibility as a man. Ms. Celeste, don’t overthink it. This won’t affect our investment deal either."

Evelyn glanced at Nathan, slightly surprised. He was clearly trying to ease Celeste’s guilt—she had just rejected Julian, and now he’d risked his life for her. Nathan didn’t want her feeling pressured to reconsider out of obligation.

Celeste understood his meaning and lowered her gaze.

Thinking of his reckless younger brother, Nathan spoke again. "We’re heading to the hospital to pick Julian up. Would you like to come?"

After all, Julian had nearly died for her. Nathan hoped her presence might lift his spirits.

This time, Celeste didn’t hesitate. But just as she was about to nod, her phone rang.

The number was unfamiliar, but the moment she answered, Edward’s furious voice blasted through the speaker.

She had long blocked the Cowells’ contacts, so he must have borrowed someone else’s phone.

"Celeste, you ungrateful wretch! First, you abandon your family, and now you’ve dragged Isabelle into danger! You knew she was fragile, yet you got involved with a violent man and let her take the hit for you! Do you really hate her so much that you’d let her die for your mistakes? Get here now and face what you’ve done!" Edward roared.

Penelope’s frantic voice chimed in, their words tumbling over each other as if afraid Celeste would hang up.

The urgency in their voices made Celeste’s stomach twist.

It felt like a nightmare coming back to life.

Nathan’s expression darkened as he listened. "Edward and Penelope are probably looking for someone to blame. I suggest you return with your team and focus on the investment report. Ignore them. You’ve cut ties—this isn’t your problem anymore."

Julian’s eyes brightened instantly.

At least she’s reasonable, Evelyn mused silently.

Julian shot her a glare. Mind your own business.

Nathan, overhearing, sighed.

"Why didn’t she come, then?" Marcus asked, curious.

"Because Edward and Penelope are at the same hospital," Nathan said flatly.

Julian’s face darkened. "Are they blaming Celeste for this? Trying to bully her again?"

"Worse," Evelyn nearly scoffed. "They want to use her as spare parts."

Julian’s expression turned thunderous, startling Marcus. What the hell is going on?

Nathan frowned, listening to Evelyn’s silent tirade.

Isabelle had been stabbed three times. Edward and Penelope were desperate to summon Celeste because two wounds had damaged her kidneys. Isabelle had always had weak organs, and now both kidneys were injured. While not immediately life-threatening, she’d need long-term care—or a transplant.

And they knew exactly who they wanted it from.

The damage was irreversible. That much was clear. So Edward and Penelope had coldly decided this was their golden opportunity—to force Celeste to donate a healthy kidney to Isabelle. They'd even inquired about skin transplantation. The brutal attack had left Isabelle's face disfigured beyond recognition, requiring extensive reconstructive surgery. But Isabelle's weakened body couldn't withstand such procedures. Naturally, their solution was to harvest skin from Celeste.

Twins meant zero rejection risks—the perfect medical match. What twisted parents. As if their children's bodies were communal property to be divided at will. Disgusting didn't even begin to cover it.

Evelyn was still seething internally when Julian suddenly launched himself from the hospital bed.

"Julian!" Marcus gasped, nearly dropping his tablet.

Nathan's brow furrowed. "Stay down. I'll deal with this."

But Julian was already storming toward the door, injured arm be damned. His eyes burned with barely contained fury. "It's just a flesh wound. I'm not paralyzed. To hell with waiting—I'm ending this now!"

Before anyone could react, he'd vanished into the hallway like a vengeful shadow.

###Chapter 39
The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the latest revisions for the third time.

This scene still doesn’t feel right.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Lillian: Nathan Blackwood just arrived at the studio. He’s asking for you.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathan. The man who had effortlessly slipped past all her defenses, the one who made her heart race with just a glance.

She typed back quickly.

Evelyn: Tell him I’ll be there in ten.

She grabbed her leather jacket and hurried out, her mind racing. The script changes weren’t the only thing bothering her. There was something else—something she couldn’t quite place.

The studio was a hive of activity when she arrived. Crew members bustled about, adjusting lights and cameras, while Preston Whitmore, the director, barked orders.

And then she saw him.

Nathan stood near the set, his dark hair slightly tousled, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room. He wore a fitted black shirt that accentuated his broad shoulders, and the sight of him sent a familiar thrill through her.

He turned, sensing her presence, and a slow, knowing smile curved his lips.

“You’re late,” he murmured as she approached.

Evelyn arched a brow. “Fashionably late, darling.”

His chuckle was low, intimate. “Always.”

Before she could respond, Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, appeared beside them, her expression cool.

“Mr. Blackwood, the producers are waiting.”

Nathan’s smile faded slightly, but he nodded. “I’ll be right there.”

Victoria shot Evelyn a look—one that was equal parts disdain and something else. Jealousy?

Evelyn ignored her, turning back to Nathan. “We need to talk. Later.”

His gaze darkened with understanding. “My place. After the shoot.”

She nodded, watching as he walked away, Victoria trailing behind him like a shadow.

The day dragged on, the tension between Evelyn and Nathan palpable every time their scenes required them to interact. Their chemistry was electric—too real, too intense—and it didn’t go unnoticed.

“Cut!” Preston called, rubbing his temples. “Evelyn, Nathan—that was perfect. But let’s try it one more time with less… heat.”

Evelyn flushed, avoiding Nathan’s knowing smirk.

By the time filming wrapped, exhaustion weighed on her. But she couldn’t back out now. Not when so much was left unsaid.

She arrived at Nathan’s penthouse just as the city lights began to flicker to life. He opened the door before she could knock, his expression unreadable.

“You came.”

Evelyn stepped inside, her heart pounding. “We need to talk about the script.”

Nathan closed the door behind her, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Is that really why you’re here?”

She swallowed hard.

No. It wasn’t.

And as his fingers brushed against hers, she knew—he knew it too.

Evelyn shook her head in disbelief. What a temper he has. Julian was already furious upon discovering Edward and Penelope were searching for Celeste. If he knew their twisted plans... She shuddered at the thought. He’d explode.

Following Julian to witness the drama, they arrived swiftly at Isabelle’s hospital room.

True to Evelyn’s expectations, Isabelle wasn’t even in the ICU. Yet Edward and Penelope had the audacity to manipulate Celeste over the phone, painting a picture of Isabelle clinging to life. Do they not fear their lies might manifest?

Meanwhile, Edward and Penelope were fuming, unable to reach Celeste, their curses filling the sterile air.

“That ungrateful girl! Her sister’s suffering because of her, and she can’t even bother to visit!” Edward spat, his face red with rage.

Penelope wrung her hands. “What now? Has Celeste truly abandoned us? If she’s this cold-hearted, she’d never agree to donate her organs to Isabelle, would she?”

“She owes it to us after what she’s done! I’ll march to her university myself—see why they’d enroll such a vile creature!”

Evelyn’s lips curled in disgust. The nerve. They spoke as if their demands were righteous, their cruelty justified. But Julian’s about to teach them otherwise.

As predicted, Julian’s fury erupted. Before anyone could react, he lunged forward, seizing Edward by the collar with his uninjured hand and slamming him against the wall with a sickening thud.

“Agh!” Edward howled, pain contorting his features.

Marcus, wide-eyed, scanned the hallway for witnesses. This was the first time he’d seen Julian lose control so violently. No point intervening now. He positioned himself as a lookout instead.

Edward, dazed, finally registered his assailant. His face paled. Julian Blackwood? Never had he imagined being manhandled by someone younger.

“Julian! Have you lost your mind? Let go!”

“Julian, stop this!” Penelope shrieked, clawing at his arm uselessly. He stood immovable, a force of wrath.

Desperate, Penelope turned to the bystanders. Nathan and Evelyn stood nearby, watching. “Nathan! Evelyn! Help us—!”

Evelyn blinked, then casually strolled to a bench and sat, crossing her legs. Might as well enjoy the show.

Penelope gaped at her indifference before pleading with Nathan. Surely the Blackwood heir won’t be as heartless?

To her dismay, Nathan glanced at Evelyn and settled down beside her before addressing Julian, "Be careful not to aggravate your injury, or Dad and Mom will worry."

With that, he noticed Evelyn secretly recording a video and nearly choked on his words. Though I suspect Dad and Mom’s morbid curiosity about this mess will outweigh their concern.

Penelope opened her mouth to speak, but no sound came out. She clutched the back of her head, swaying slightly as if the shock might send her crashing to the floor.

Edward was livid, but Julian—towering over him—hauled him up by the collar like a ragdoll. His feet kicked uselessly in the air, face flushing crimson with humiliation. "We are your elders! Have you lost your damn mind?" he roared.

Julian’s grip tightened. "Funny, I was about to ask you the same thing. Parents? You’re monsters. Thank God Celeste cut ties with you. Any longer, and you’d have skinned her alive."

Edward and Penelope gaped at him, stunned. Since when had Julian become this feral over Celeste?

Penelope found her voice, shrill with desperation. "What nonsense are you spouting? Weren’t you hurt too? This is all Celeste’s fault! As the older sister, she failed to protect Isabelle—no, she dragged her into danger! If not for her, would Isabelle’s face be ruined? Her kidneys damaged? Even if she refused to help, she owed us reparations! She knew and ran—left her sister to suffer! What kind of heartless wretch—"

Evelyn cut in with a derisive laugh. "Let me get this straight. You wanted to harvest her skin and kidney. Newsflash: Isabelle can use her own skin grafts. And kidneys? There’s a donor list. She’s not dying. So why Celeste? Do you hate her so much you’d carve her up for parts?"

Julian’s voice was pure venom. "‘Help each other’? When has Isabelle ever lifted a finger for Celeste?"

Nathan’s smirk was razor-thin. "They’ve invested too many years worshipping Isabelle to stop now."

Evelyn nodded. These fossils would rather eat glass than admit they’re wrong.

A flicker of guilt crossed Edward’s face before he snarled, "This is a family matter—"

Ah, the classic deflection. Evelyn rolled her eyes internally.

Nathan leaned forward, eyes glinting. "A ‘family matter,’ huh? Tell me… did you even bother getting tested for compatibility?"

The room went dead silent.

"Statistically, parents are the closest matches after a twin." His tone was lethally casual. "Or was sacrifice only ever meant for Celeste?"

Penelope’s mouth opened and closed like a fish. Edward looked like he’d been tasered.

Evelyn’s stomach turned. Their audacity—

"Darling," she purred, laying a hand on Nathan’s arm, "you’re being unfair. The Cowells adore both daughters. I’m sure they tested themselves first. Only failing would force them to… repurpose Celeste." Her smile was saccharine. "After all, what loving parents would mutilate their healthy daughter when they could volunteer?"

Nathan tilted his head. "Is that so?"

"Obviously! They’d never doom a young woman to scars, chronic pain, or a lifetime hiding in turtlenecks. Not when they could heroically donate themselves." She batted her lashes. "They’re parents, not butchers. Even hyenas don’t eat their own."

Nathan nodded solemnly. "An excellent point."

Julian bared his teeth. "Prove it. Get tested today."

The blood drained from Edward’s face.

###Chapter 40

The morning sun cast a golden glow over the city as Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the sleek black car waiting for her. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her designer bag, the weight of the past few days pressing heavily on her shoulders. The meeting with Nathan Blackwood loomed ahead—an encounter she both dreaded and anticipated.

Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, handed her a tablet. "The latest reports from the board meeting are in," she said, her voice low but urgent. "Victoria Hayes has been making moves behind the scenes again."

Evelyn’s lips thinned. Of course she had. Victoria had never been one to sit idly by. "What does she want this time?"

"Control over the new merger," Lillian replied. "She’s been whispering in the ears of the senior partners, trying to sway them."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "She won’t succeed."

The car pulled up to the towering Blackwood Enterprises building, its glass façade reflecting the sky like a mirror. As she stepped out, she caught sight of Nathan standing near the entrance, his dark suit impeccably tailored, his expression unreadable.

Their eyes met, and for a moment, the world seemed to pause.

"You’re late," he said, his voice cool.

Evelyn arched a brow. "By two minutes. I’m sure the company will survive."

A flicker of amusement crossed his face before he schooled his features back into neutrality. "Victoria’s already inside. She’s been waiting."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "Then let’s not keep her waiting any longer."

Inside the boardroom, Victoria Hayes sat at the far end of the table, her crimson nails tapping against the polished wood. She smiled as they entered—a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

"Ah, the dynamic duo," she purred. "I was beginning to think you’d forgotten about our little meeting."

Nathan took his seat at the head of the table, his gaze sharp. "Let’s get to the point, Victoria. What do you want?"

Victoria leaned forward, her eyes gleaming. "The same thing I’ve always wanted—a seat at the table where the real decisions are made."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "You already have one."

"Not the one that matters," Victoria countered smoothly. "The merger with Sinclair Media is too important to leave in inexperienced hands."

Evelyn’s temper flared. "In case you’ve forgotten, I am Sinclair Media."

Victoria’s smile widened. "For now."

The air in the room grew thick with tension. Nathan’s voice cut through it like a blade. "Enough. The merger proceeds as planned. Evelyn retains full control of her company’s assets."

Victoria’s expression darkened. "You’re making a mistake."

Nathan’s gaze never wavered. "Then it’s mine to make."

For a long moment, no one spoke. Then, with a sharp exhale, Victoria rose from her seat. "This isn’t over."

Evelyn watched her leave, the door clicking shut behind her. She turned to Nathan. "Why did you back me?"

He met her eyes, something unreadable flickering in his gaze. "Because you’re right."

It wasn’t the whole truth—she could tell. But for now, it was enough.

As they stepped out of the boardroom together, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that the real battle had only just begun.

Evelyn's biting sarcasm sliced through the corridor like a razor. Each word landed like a stinging slap across Edward and Penelope's faces—more brutal than any direct insult.

The humiliation was exquisite. Their complexions drained to parchment-white, veins throbbing at their temples as if they might collapse from sheer outrage.

With a final, honeyed jab, Evelyn added, "Am I wrong, Mr. and Mrs. Cowell? Such a shame you failed the compatibility test. Almost poetic, really."

Marcus nearly applauded. God, this is cathartic.

Penelope crumpled to the floor, trembling. Bloodshot eyes darted away from the crowd, yet her lips still twisted in defiance. "We—we're elderly, you can't expect—" Lies. They'd never considered Celeste's feelings, only her duty as their sacrificial lamb.

"Pathetic," Julian sneered, releasing Edward with a shove that sent the older man sprawling against the wall. The indignity of being chastised by their juniors left them seething.

Edward, despite his undignified position, bellowed, "This is Cowell family business! Outsiders like you have no right—get out!"

Evelyn's smile turned lethal. "Oh, but I insist on staying. In fact, I'll make sure everyone knows how you treated your own flesh and blood."

Penelope's shriek pierced the air. "You wouldn't dare!"

"Afraid?" Marcus drawled, stepping forward. "Weren't you just demanding the school 'expose' Celeste? Maybe take a long look in the mirror first."

Penelope gaped like a suffocating fish.

Evelyn and Marcus exchanged a glance—a silent well played. Nathan, wedged between them, sulked. Hey, I helped too.

Edward spat, "Have you all gone mad? This has nothing to do with you! Celeste cut ties with the Blackwoods!"

Julian's voice dropped to subzero. "The broken engagement was my failure. I wasn't worthy of her." His gaze turned glacial as he loomed over the couple. "But make no mistake—Celeste's life? Her pain? That concerns me deeply." A pause, loaded with venom. "There's something you've forgotten—"

"You don’t know yet, do you? Your precious daughter is carrying an STD. She got it from Vincent Holloway. The reason she was attacked today? She tried to ambush Celeste with a syringe. She deliberately waited there, plotting to harm her, and now she’s reaping what she sowed. She loves pretending to be Celeste, doesn’t she? Well, she got exactly what she deserved!"

Edward and Penelope froze, their faces draining of color.

An STD? How?

"No! That’s impossible!" Penelope shrieked, her voice cracking.

Suddenly, the odd behavior of the doctors and nurses made sense—their hushed whispers, the way they avoided direct answers. And the police had mentioned having "urgent questions" for Isabelle, unrelated to the stabbing.

If Julian’s words were true, then Isabelle had knowingly tried to spread her disease. That wasn’t just reckless—it was criminal.

"If you still think Celeste should lift a finger to save her after this, you’re worse than monsters," Julian spat.

Edward and Penelope’s faces burned with humiliation. The revelation had struck them like a thunderbolt. But Julian wasn’t done.

"Listen carefully. Keep your precious Isabelle far away from me and Celeste. If I ever catch her—or either of you—meddling in our lives again, I’ll make sure your family becomes the laughingstock of the entire world. You’ll learn what it means to be utterly despised."

He didn’t need the Blackwood family’s influence to make good on that threat. As an A-list actor, his words alone carried enough weight to send chills down Marcus Donovan’s spine.

Edward and Penelope trembled, their anger drowned out by raw fear.

"Fine. We won’t ask for her kidney. But must you sever all ties?" Edward rasped.

Julian scoffed. "Ties? What ties? Did any of you ever treat her like family? Being associated with you is the last thing she wants. Wake up. You lost the right to call yourselves her parents long ago."

His usual composure had shattered in the face of their shamelessness.

"You—!" Edward choked on his fury, unable to form a coherent sentence.

Penelope, meanwhile, dissolved into tears. She turned to Nathan, desperate. "Is this how the Blackwoods raise their children? Threatening elders who’ve been family friends for generations?"

Nathan’s expression remained icy. "Let me ask you something. Is it part of your family’s values to let your diseased daughter knock on my brother’s door in the middle of the night? What exactly was she planning?"

Edward and Penelope paled, their mouths snapping shut under the weight of his glare.

When Isabelle woke from anesthesia, her screams echoed through the hospital. The moment her fingers brushed the jagged scar splitting her face, her wails turned hysterical.

Her love life was in ruins. Her career was over. Her entire existence had crumbled.

Edward stared blankly at his own hands, remembering how often they had struck Celeste. A bitter, broken laugh escaped him—more of a sob than anything else.

Then came the call from Reginald, the current head of the Cowell family. His voice was laced with fury as he ordered them to act as if Celeste had never existed—and to never dare approach her again. If they did, they’d be exiled from the family for good.

The line went dead. Edward and Penelope stood in silence, their hollow gazes fixed on Isabelle. They had spent years doting on her overseas, but now, everything had changed.

From that moment on, the three of them vanished from Celeste’s world.

When Celeste finally turned on her phone, the first thing she did was message Julian, asking about his injury.

Julian, who had been lounging at home while nursing his wounds, bolted upright, his heart racing.

I'm no longer blacklisted! She's unblocked me! Hooray!

The moment Evelyn confirmed Celeste would visit the Blackwood manor, Julian practically flew down the stairs, his excitement causing a minor earthquake in the house. Margaret, Sophia, and Evelyn, who had been engrossed in a drama series, nearly jumped out of their seats.

When they demanded an explanation, his grin was infectious—soon, all three women were buzzing with anticipation.

Julian rushed outside to wait for Celeste, but before long, he stormed back in, dragging someone behind him.

His face was thunderous.

It was Genevieve, who was supposed to return home that evening.

Margaret blinked. What in the world happened? Julian looked ready to murder someone, while Genevieve’s eyes were red-rimmed, her lips trembling.

Evelyn discreetly checked the system. Oh.

Genevieve had secretly gotten herself a boyfriend.

Margaret and Sophia gasped in unison.

Evelyn’s inner monologue continued. When Julian had stepped outside to wait for Celeste, he’d spotted Genevieve with a blond man. The guy had a cigarette dangling from his lips, blowing smoke directly into her face. One arm was wrapped possessively around her waist, while the other had slipped beneath her skirt, fingers tracing her thigh.

Julian had seen red.

Margaret and Sophia’s eyes widened in horror. Our baby sister—tainted by some random man?

###Chapter 41

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered documents on her desk. Her fingers trembled slightly as she traced the edge of a faded photograph—one she hadn’t seen in years.

Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Hayes.

The image was taken at a gala, their smiles bright, their bodies angled toward each other in a way that spoke of intimacy. Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

How long had this been going on?

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, knocked lightly before entering, her expression cautious. “Evelyn, you have a call from Preston Whitmore. He says it’s urgent.”

Evelyn exhaled sharply, shoving the photo aside. “Tell him I’ll call back.”

Lillian hesitated. “He mentioned it’s about the Midnight Secrets project. The studio is reconsidering your lead role.”

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn’s lips. Of course. First Nathan’s betrayal, now her career was slipping through her fingers.

“Fine. Put him through.”

As Lillian retreated, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with another notification—a message from an unknown number.

"You don’t know the half of it, Evelyn. Meet me at The Velvet Lounge tonight. Come alone."

Her pulse quickened. Was this a trap? Or did someone else know about Nathan and Victoria?

Across town, Nathan Blackwood paced his office, his jaw clenched. His brother, Julian, leaned against the desk, arms crossed.

“You’re being reckless,” Julian warned. “If Evelyn finds out—”

“She already suspects,” Nathan snapped. “Victoria made sure of that.”

Julian’s eyes darkened. “Then fix it. Before she digs deeper.”

Nathan’s phone lit up with a call—Victoria’s name flashing on the screen. He ignored it.

Meanwhile, at The Velvet Lounge, a shadowy figure waited in a secluded booth, swirling a glass of whiskey. The dim lighting obscured their face, but their lips curled into a smirk as they glanced at the entrance.

Evelyn would come.

And when she did, the game would change forever.

Though Evelyn had inherited the original owner's memories, this was her first time meeting Genevieve in person.

Genevieve had an enchanting, doll-like beauty. Her button nose and rosebud lips perfectly complemented her large, doe eyes—clear and sparkling with the innocent charm of a college girl. Her porcelain skin looked so delicate it might bruise at a touch. She resembled a sheltered princess who had never faced the harsh realities of the world, her naivety radiating from every gesture.

"Julian, didn't you hurt your hand? Stop pulling!" Genevieve protested weakly, trying to wriggle free.

Julian dragged her toward Margaret, complaining, "Mom, I just caught Gen tangled up with some street thug! You need to grill her properly before she gets fooled by shady characters!"

Genevieve flushed, her voice trembling as she defended, "Julian! You can’t talk about Damian like that! He’s not a thug! How can you judge him just by his looks? Just because he has dyed hair, piercings, and tattoos doesn’t make him bad!"

Tears welled in her eyes, as if someone had insulted a masterpiece she'd poured her soul into. Too timid to argue outright, she muttered under her breath, "Plenty of artists in the industry look like that too. Julian, you’ve dyed your hair every color under the sun—does that make you a delinquent?"

"I’m not talking about his appearance! It’s his behavior! The way he was acting—"

Genevieve’s face burned scarlet. "Julian, stop!"

Julian scoffed, throwing his hands up. "I don’t have time for this. I’m going to wait for Celeste." With that, he stormed out.

Head bowed, Genevieve still managed a polite greeting. "Mom, Sophia, Evelyn… I’m home. Please don’t listen to Julian. Damian is a good person."

The Blackwoods were progressive when it came to their children’s relationships—but Evelyn had already filled them in. As Genevieve’s family, they couldn’t help but side-eye her rough-around-the-edges boyfriend.

With that look and attitude? Total troublemaker.

They couldn’t picture their sweet, sheltered girl standing beside someone like him.

Margaret fretted, "Since when have you been dating behind our backs? Who is he? A student? Does he work? How long have you known each other?"

Sophia frowned. "Genevieve, did you even message the driver to pick you up from the airport? Did that boy bring you home? You should’ve told us you were coming!"

The Blackwood family mansion was unusually tense that afternoon. Genevieve sat stiffly in the living room, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her dress as Margaret and Sophia bombarded her with questions about her new boyfriend.

"It's Damian Prescott. We've known each other for a while," Genevieve explained, her voice barely above a whisper. "You remember him, right?"

At the mention of the Prescott name, Margaret and Sophia visibly relaxed. At least he wasn’t some stranger with questionable intentions.

Genevieve hesitated before continuing, her cheeks flushing. "We only started dating recently. I was hesitant at first, but... he’s different. He’s always there when I need him, the first to step up when there’s trouble. He’s responsible, kind... and I really like him."

Her words were laced with sincerity, her eyes shining with affection. Yet, Margaret and Sophia exchanged wary glances. Love was unpredictable, and they weren’t entirely convinced of Damian’s sincerity.

Just then, Evelyn—who had been silently observing—let out an amused scoff. Genevieve, mistaking it for a slight against Damian, immediately jumped to his defense. "What’s so funny?"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard. She hadn’t expected Genevieve to address her directly. "Nothing," she replied smoothly, though inwardly, she found it amusing how defensive Genevieve was being.

Margaret, sensing the brewing tension, quickly intervened. "Never mind that. Your father and Julian aren’t home yet. We’ll discuss this properly when they return. For now, why don’t you rest? You must be tired."

Genevieve nodded obediently, and Sophia followed her upstairs, eager to fill her in on Evelyn’s peculiar situation.

Once in her room, Genevieve listened in stunned silence as Sophia explained. "Wait—you’re telling me we can hear Evelyn’s thoughts?"

Sophia sighed. "Yes, and it’s as bizarre as it sounds. Nathan’s been discreetly looking for a solution—maybe a priest or something—because if Evelyn ever finds out, it could backfire horribly. No one wants their private thoughts exposed."

Genevieve frowned, struggling to process it. "But... why keep it from her?"

"Because," Sophia said firmly, "it’s her secret. If word gets out, she could be in real danger. So not a word to anyone, understand?"

The gravity in Sophia’s tone made Genevieve nod solemnly, though she still had her doubts.

Just then, Genevieve’s phone buzzed—undoubtedly Damian. She gave Sophia pleading puppy-dog eyes, and Sophia rolled hers before turning to leave.

But before she could, a sudden, anguished cry echoed from downstairs.

Was that... Julian?

###Chapter 42

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her coffee, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp air. Her phone buzzed—another message from Nathan Blackwood. She hesitated before reading it, her fingers hovering over the screen.

"We need to talk. Tonight. My place."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Nathan had been distant since their last argument, his cold demeanor cutting deeper than she cared to admit. She typed a quick reply—"Fine."—before tossing her phone onto the sofa.

Across town, Nathan stood by his floor-to-ceiling windows, staring at the city below. His jaw clenched as he replayed their fight in his mind. Evelyn’s accusations still stung—"You’re just like your father. Cold. Calculating."

His phone chimed. Her response was curt, as expected.

Victoria Hayes, his ever-watchful secretary, knocked lightly before entering. "Sir, your sister Sophia is on line two."

Nathan dismissed her with a wave. "Tell her I’ll call back."

Victoria lingered, her sharp eyes assessing him. "You should eat something. You’ve barely touched lunch."

"I’m not hungry." His tone left no room for argument.

Victoria sighed but retreated, closing the door behind her.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s agent, Serena Whitmore, barged into her penthouse, waving a script. "You need to see this! Preston Whitmore wants you for his new project—lead role!"

Evelyn barely glanced at it. "Not now, Serena."

Serena frowned. "What’s going on with you? You’ve been off for days."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Nathan."

Serena groaned. "Again? That man is a walking red flag."

Evelyn shot her a glare. "It’s complicated."

Serena crossed her arms. "No, it’s toxic. You’re Evelyn Sinclair—Oscar-nominated actress, fashion icon. You don’t need his drama."

Evelyn didn’t respond. Because deep down, she feared Serena was right.

As evening fell, Evelyn arrived at Nathan’s penthouse, her stomach in knots. The elevator ride felt endless. When the doors opened, Nathan stood there, his dark eyes unreadable.

"You came," he said, stepping aside to let her in.

Evelyn walked past him, her heels clicking against the marble floor. "What’s so urgent?"

Nathan poured two glasses of whiskey, handing her one. "We can’t keep doing this."

Evelyn scoffed. "Doing what? Fighting? Ignoring each other? You’re the one who pulled away."

Nathan’s grip tightened around his glass. "Because you compared me to him."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She hadn’t meant it—not entirely. But the words had spilled out in anger.

Before she could respond, the doorbell rang.

Nathan frowned. "I’m not expecting anyone."

He strode to the door and yanked it open—only to freeze.

Standing there, impeccably dressed and smirking, was Vincent Holloway, the notorious playboy who’d once tried to sabotage Evelyn’s career.

"Long time no see, Blackwood," Vincent drawled, his gaze sliding past Nathan to land on Evelyn. "And the lovely Miss Sinclair. What a coincidence."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Nathan’s voice turned lethal. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Vincent’s smirk widened. "I heard you two were having… troubles. Thought I’d offer my assistance."

Evelyn set her glass down with a sharp clink. "Get out."

Vincent feigned hurt. "So hostile. And here I was, ready to share some interesting information about your dear Nathan."

Nathan stepped forward, his frame rigid with barely contained fury. "You have three seconds to leave before I throw you out."

Vincent chuckled, unfazed. "Fine, fine. But Evelyn—when you’re tired of his games, you know where to find me."

With that, he sauntered away, leaving behind a suffocating silence.

Evelyn turned to Nathan, her heart pounding. "What was that about?"

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Nothing you need to worry about."

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "That’s your answer for everything, isn’t it? Nothing you need to worry about."

Nathan reached for her, but she stepped back.

"I can’t do this anymore," she whispered.

Nathan’s hand dropped. "Evelyn—"

"No." She grabbed her purse, her voice trembling. "I need space. From you. From this."

Nathan didn’t stop her as she walked out.

The elevator doors closed, sealing her decision.

But as the penthouse faded from view, one thought consumed her:

What did Vincent know?

And why did she have a sinking feeling it would change everything?

No sooner had Genevieve and Sophia reached the top of the stairs than an exhilarated Julian returned with Celeste in tow.

They exchanged brief pleasantries, but Julian kept glancing at his mother, silently urging her to give them privacy. Margaret, perceptive as ever, quickly whisked Evelyn away, leaving the two alone.

The moment they were out of earshot, Julian eagerly pushed the platter of snacks and fruits toward Celeste.

His enthusiasm left her momentarily stunned, as if the boy from her childhood—the one who always saved the best treats for her—had suddenly reappeared.

"Don’t strain yourself. Your injury—" she started.

Julian immediately stilled his bandaged hand, using only his uninjured one to serve her, flashing her a lopsided grin. "I told you, I heal fast. It’s nothing."

Celeste exhaled in relief. "Actually, I came today because there’s something else I need to discuss."

"Go ahead." Julian straightened, his entire demeanor shifting to one of absolute focus, as if nothing else in the world mattered but her words.

Celeste’s brow furrowed. "I need your assurance that our team’s overseas research collaboration won’t be disrupted."

A shadow flickered in Julian’s eyes.

She pressed on, firm. "Working abroad is essential for our project. Your additional conditions made Prof. Holloway hesitate. Now that we’ve settled things between us, I hope you’ll—"

"I’m not using the investment to keep you here," Julian cut in, voice rough. "I’d never stand in the way of your future."

He lowered his gaze, shoulders slumping slightly. "I won’t lie—I had selfish reasons. But staying in the country won’t hinder your research. Hell, I’ll double the funding if it helps."

Celeste’s expression remained unyielding. "Money isn’t the issue. If it were, no one would uproot their lives for five years. We can’t let the Blackwood Group take a loss either. Please withdraw the extra conditions. We need to go."

Julian studied her resolute face, his lips trembling before he forced out, "Alright. I’ll talk to Nathan."

Mission accomplished, Celeste stood abruptly. "Thank you. I should go—we have preparations to make. Every day counts."

Julian shot to his feet.

"Stay. You’re hurt," she said gently, offering a small, final smile. "I wish you happiness."

Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, Julian blurted, "Is this really goodbye?"

Celeste paused, taking in his red-rimmed eyes. Her chest ached, but she’d learned her lesson. She wasn’t ready to trust again—not when the wounds were still fresh.

"Right now, I just want to focus on my work. And honestly? I might not come back after five years. I’m considering settling overseas permanently." She met his gaze squarely. "It’s better this way."

No resentment colored her words—just quiet finality. Without hesitation, she turned and walked away.

Julian stood frozen, tears burning his eyes. The agony of watching her leave was a physical pain, sharp as a blade.

She’s going abroad, not vanishing off the earth! Since when are plane tickets a barrier? A hysterical laugh bubbled up. The Blackwoods own a damn private jet!

Was he really this dense?

Down the hall, Sophia and Genevieve exchanged worried glances before Julian suddenly bolted past them, tears streaming as he sprinted after Celeste.

Later, phone pressed to his ear, Julian made another call. "Marcus, I’m relocating my studio overseas. Want to take on the international market together?"

He’d realized: clinging to Celeste would only reopen old wounds. He refused to be the source of her pain. This might be his only chance to stay close—not as a lover, but as a silent guardian. If she ever needed someone, he’d be there.

The announcement left everyone stunned—especially Evelyn.

Wait, that’s where I work! I haven’t even earned a paycheck yet! Am I getting laid off before I start?!

Julian, mid-plan, overheard her internal panic. On the phone, Marcus mentioned Evelyn too.

Julian glanced at her. "Don’t worry. The transition won’t happen overnight. I’ll set you up before I leave. Marcus promised to line up projects to boost your reputation first."

Evelyn blinked. ...Being unemployed doesn’t sound so bad. Less work.

Genevieve, eavesdropping from upstairs, stifled a laugh. She couldn’t tell if Evelyn had spoken aloud—Julian’s response fit either way.

Back in her room, Genevieve’s phone rang incessantly. She answered to a sharp, "Why didn’t you pick up?!"

The caller caught himself, voice softening. "I worry when I can’t reach you. Don’t do that again."


###Chapter 43

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of a thousand crystal chandeliers. Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her silver Venetian mask, its delicate lace edges brushing against her flushed cheeks. Around her, masked figures swirled in elegant gowns and tailored suits, their identities hidden beneath layers of silk and mystery.

Nathan Blackwood stood at the center of the room, his dark suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His mask—black with gold filigree—did little to conceal the intensity of his gaze as it swept over the crowd. When his eyes locked onto Evelyn’s, a shiver raced down her spine.

He knows it’s me.

Victoria Hayes, dressed in a scandalously low-cut emerald gown, sidled up to Nathan, her fingers trailing possessively along his arm. "Darling, you promised me a dance," she purred, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Evelyn clenched her fists, the bite of jealousy sharp in her chest. But before she could react, a familiar voice whispered in her ear.

"Don’t let her get to you." Serena Whitmore, her agent and closest confidante, handed her a flute of champagne. "He’s been watching you all night."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "It doesn’t matter. After what happened last week—"

"Stop." Serena cut her off with a pointed look. "Tonight isn’t about the past. It’s about this." She gestured to the room, where the orchestra struck up a waltz. "Go claim what’s yours."

Across the room, Nathan disentangled himself from Victoria with a polite but firm nod. His eyes never left Evelyn as he strode toward her, the crowd parting like the Red Sea before him.

"May I have this dance?" His voice was low, rough with unspoken emotion.

Evelyn hesitated—just for a heartbeat—before placing her hand in his. "You may."

As they stepped onto the dance floor, the world narrowed to just the two of them. His hand settled at the small of her back, warm and sure. The music swelled, and they moved as one, their bodies perfectly in sync despite the months of distance between them.

"You’re avoiding me," Nathan murmured, his breath brushing her ear.

Evelyn stiffened. "I’ve been busy."

"Liar." His grip tightened imperceptibly. "You’ve been running. Just like you always do."

The accusation stung. She lifted her chin. "And you’ve been what, exactly? Playing house with Victoria?"

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "You know that’s not what this is."

"Do I?" Her voice cracked. "Because from where I’m standing, it looks like you’ve moved on."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. Before he could respond, a crash echoed through the ballroom. The music screeched to a halt as all heads turned toward the entrance.

There, framed by the double doors, stood Cassandra—Nathan’s first love—her ivory gown torn, her face streaked with tears.

"Nathan," she gasped, her voice raw with desperation. "You have to help me. He’s here."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Because standing behind Cassandra, his expression twisted with fury, was the one man Nathan had sworn to protect her from—his estranged brother, Julian Blackwood.

And he wasn’t alone.

Genevieve froze for a second. Damian had never spoken to her so harshly before. But knowing it came from concern, she quickly replied, "I'm sorry, Damien. Something came up, and I missed your call."

"Is your brother giving you trouble because of us?" His voice was laced with worry.

"Don't worry, I'm fine. Julian just has a temper. He's upset because I didn’t tell them about us sooner. Once I explain properly, everything will be fine."

Damien scoffed through the phone. Why does he still treat you like a child? You’re an adult, Gen. Independent. Free. You don’t owe them every detail of your life.

"I’m the youngest. They just care about me," Genevieve said with a soft smile. "Oh! My sister Evelyn just told me—"

She cut herself off. Instinct urged her to share Evelyn’s secret with Damian, but Evian’s warning flashed in her mind.

"What?"

"Um… Nothing."

Damien’s tone darkened. "You’re keeping things from me now? We’re supposed to share everything. Everything. I don’t hide anything from you. But you? It hurts, Gen. Makes me wonder if I love you more than you love me."

Genevieve’s cheeks burned. "No! That’s not true!"

She bit her lip. Her upbringing screamed at her—this isn’t your secret to tell.

Of course I trust Damien… but this isn’t mine to share.

His voice turned sharp. "Do they look down on me? Think I’m not good enough for the Quirk heiress?"

Genevieve gasped. "How could you think that? You’re amazing!"

"Amazing?" He laughed bitterly. "You’re Genevieve Quirk. And to them, I’m just some nobody."

Panic clawed at her. "My family doesn’t care about status! They just want me happy!"

"Really? Doesn’t matter if they approve. I chose you. No one’s tearing us apart," Damian declared, voice steel.

Her heart fluttered. A shy hum was all she could manage.

That evening, the Blackwoods gathered for dinner—the first time in months.

Genevieve adored her nephew, Theodore, showering him with gifts. Finally, she wasn’t the baby anymore.

Once Sophia put the boy to bed, the family settled in the living room.

The topic? Genevieve’s love life.

Richard and Nathan had dug into Damian’s background. Julian’s complaints didn’t help—no respect, too handsy in public. But young love was reckless. They let it slide.

Richard leaned forward. "You said your professor hired him temporarily. Does he not have a steady job?"

Genevieve brightened. "He’s starting his own gallery! He’s learning the ropes now. Once Camille and I graduate, he’ll showcase our work."

The room went still. Except Evelyn.

Margaret frowned. "But you always said—"

Genevieve laughed. "I was naive! High prices mean people value my art. And Damien said we could donate the profits. It’s meaningful."

Silence.

Technically true… but something’s off.

Genevieve’s head snapped toward Evelyn. It’s real! I really can hear her!

The others coughed, signaling her to stay quiet.

Julian crossed his arms. "How does he afford rent? Or is he mooching off you?"

Genevieve stiffened. "We just started dating! I wouldn’t ask that! But he rents his own place, does odd jobs at campus. He’s learning."

Dropped out after middle school. Been out for years. Evelyn’s internal sigh echoed.

The Blackwoods’ faces darkened.

Genevieve’s hands trembled. "Education doesn’t define someone! His family couldn’t afford school—they prioritized Camille’s art. You’re not judging him for that, are you?"

Nathan’s calm voice cut through. "Why would you assume we’d think that?"

Genevieve blinked. "Isn’t it… obvious?"

His gaze sharpened. "The Genevieve I know wouldn’t jump to that conclusion. Who put that idea in your head?"

The room tensed.

"N-No one! It’s just logic!"

Evelyn’s thought rang clear: Oh, Gen. Your guilty face says it all. Boyfriend’s words, not yours.

Genevieve paled. "I—"

Terrible liar. Evelyn mused.

Nathan didn’t relent. "You two aren’t right for each other."

###Chapter 44

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse floor as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. Her phone buzzed incessantly—Victoria Hayes had sent a dozen messages overnight, each more urgent than the last.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. Now."

She groaned, rubbing her temples. Victoria’s relentless scheming was exhausting. Before she could respond, another notification popped up—this time from Nathan Blackwood.

"Breakfast in twenty. Wear something comfortable."

Her pulse quickened. Nathan had been distant since the gala, his usual sharp wit replaced by an unreadable silence. What had changed?

Across the city, Nathan stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, staring at the skyline. His assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered by the door.

"Sir, the contracts for the merger are ready," she said. "But there’s an issue—Victoria Hayes has been digging into Evelyn’s past."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "What did she find?"

"Nothing concrete yet. But if she keeps pushing—"

"Handle it," he cut in, voice icy. "No one touches Evelyn."

Lillian nodded and slipped out, leaving Nathan alone with his thoughts. He exhaled sharply. The game was getting dangerous, and Evelyn was still unaware of the stakes.

Evelyn stepped into the rooftop garden of Nathan’s penthouse, the breeze tousling her hair. He was already there, setting out an elaborate spread of pastries and fruit.

"You’re late," he remarked without looking up.

"Traffic," she lied, sliding into the seat opposite him.

Nathan finally met her gaze, his dark eyes unreadable. "We need to talk about Victoria."

Evelyn’s fork stilled. "What about her?"

"She’s not just after the company. She’s after you."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. "Why?"

Nathan leaned forward, voice low. "Because she knows what you mean to me."

The air between them crackled with tension. Evelyn’s breath hitched. Was this a confession—or another calculated move in their twisted game?

Before she could respond, Nathan’s phone rang. He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening.

"We’ll finish this later," he said, standing abruptly. "Stay here. Don’t answer the door for anyone."

Evelyn watched him leave, her mind racing. What wasn’t he telling her? And why did she feel like the walls were closing in?

Victoria Hayes smirked as she scrolled through the latest dossier on Evelyn. The pieces were falling into place. All she needed was one final push to tear them apart.

Her phone buzzed—a message from an unknown number.

"The truth about Nathan’s first love? Meet me at the docks. Midnight."

Victoria’s smile widened. Game on.

The moment the words left Nathan's lips, Genevieve's eyes welled up instantly. Her nose turned pink—she had always been quick to cry. Overwhelmed, she couldn't even muster a rebuttal. Tears pooled in her wide eyes, her lips trembling pitifully.

Evelyn thought, Oh no, this is a disaster. I can't stand seeing Gen cry. Nathan's being way too harsh on her.

Nathan, on the other hand, was baffled. I merely made a suggestion—calmly, at that.

Evelyn sighed internally. Today alone, I've witnessed two Blackwood family members in tears.

Richard and Nathan exchanged glances. Who else cried?

Julian cleared his throat awkwardly.

Evelyn mused, Does their entire family have this emotional streak? And why is it always over matters of the heart?

Genevieve was on the verge of breaking down.

Julian and Sophia averted their gazes, shifting uncomfortably.

Richard and Margaret shared a silent look. No, absolutely not, we never— Richard nudged Margaret suddenly, giving her a wounded expression. You made me cry when we were young.

Margaret shot him a glare. You upset me first.

Nathan, the only man in the Blackwood family who had never shed a tear over love, sat with his chin lifted proudly.

Though… Evelyn's thoughts took a mischievous turn. Has he really never cried? He has been dumped before, hasn't he? Ah, I missed it. I would’ve loved to see this unshakable man reduced to tears. It must’ve been hilarious. If he ever cries again, I’m recording it.

The more she imagined it, the more amused she became.

Nathan’s expression darkened further. Using Genevieve’s distress as leverage, he continued, "If you disagree, speak up. Control your emotions. Crying solves nothing. I haven’t shed a tear since I was six—learn from me. Don’t be like Julian, who bawls over every failed romance."

Julian bristled. Excuse me? Why am I suddenly the example of emotional instability?

Genevieve sniffled. I want to cry, but between Evelyn’s chaotic thoughts and Nathan’s bizarre lecture, my emotions are all tangled. Now the tears won’t even come.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. Has he lost his mind? Why would a sweet girl like Gen want to emulate an emotionally stunted man like him?

Genevieve nodded internally. Evelyn’s absolutely right.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. No, I’m just emphasizing that I’ve never cried over a woman. Focus on what’s important! And if you’re hoping to see me cry, keep dreaming.

Oddly enough, the tension in the room eased slightly.

Genevieve wiped her eyes, managing to hold back her tears. She retorted, "If our family doesn’t look down on him, what’s the issue?"

Nathan’s tone turned grave. "Your values clash. You prioritize emotional connection over status, yet he fixated on rank the moment you started dating. Did he not realize the disparity before pursuing you?"

"Maybe he’s insecure because he likes me too much?"

"He can be, but if he truly cared, he wouldn’t have weaponized it. All he’s done is pit you against us before we even met him. You’re already defending him when we’ve said nothing." Nathan’s logic was unshakable, likely honed from witnessing Julian and Sophia’s romantic disasters.

As the family’s sole voice of reason, he’d abandoned his usual hands-off approach.

Genevieve faltered. His words struck a chord, yet defiance lingered. She fell silent, deep in thought.

"Nathan, Damian isn’t as brilliant as you. How can you hold him to your standards?"

For once, Nathan was speechless.

The room collectively nodded. Fair point.

Truthfully, background didn’t matter if someone was willing to grow. Values could be nurtured over time.

Evelyn smirked internally. Who knew Gen had such a sharp tongue? It’s rare to see Nathan stumped.

Genevieve preened at the unspoken praise.

Nathan exhaled, turning to Evelyn with a silent plea. A little support here?

Evelyn blinked innocently. Oh, so now you need my help after failing to convince Gen? Desperate much? What am I supposed to say—that Damian seems to be manipulating her against you all?

Genevieve paled. No way. Damian wouldn’t do that.

Hard to say. Evelyn pondered. Gen mentioned wanting to tell her family about the relationship, yet Damian spun it as them infantilizing her. Unusual. He even listed "normal" experiences she’s missed—smoking, clubbing, fighting—as if her sheltered life was a flaw.

Genevieve stiffened, realization dawning. Was he… driving a wedge between us?

But he just wanted to protect me, she argued weakly. And he’s not wrong. Even Camille said I haven’t lived fully.

Evelyn resisted the urge to facepalm. Plenty of twenty-year-olds haven’t done those things either.

Genevieve froze. Really?

And why must she mirror his experiences to be normal? Evelyn countered. Gen attended university—by his logic, isn’t his lack of education the anomaly?

Genevieve’s mind spun into chaos.

Evelyn watched, bemused. She was so fiery earlier. What happened?

Genevieve excused herself abruptly.

The gathering dissolved soon after. Before Evelyn could leave, Richard patted her shoulder approvingly.

Nathan followed suit. "Well said."

Huh? Evelyn frowned. I was just playing devil’s advocate.

Baffled, she retreated to her room. Passing Genevieve’s door, she overheard a heated phone conversation.

First love breakups are never easy.

Meanwhile, Julian and Richard joined Nathan in his study.

When Genevieve first moved to campus, Nathan had vetted Camille—ensuring her family was clean but nothing more. He believed in letting Genevieve learn judgment herself.

But romantic partners? That demanded scrutiny.

After a brief discussion, the Blackwood men reached a decision.

The next morning, Julian intercepted Genevieve at breakfast. "Running away?"

"N-no, I just prefer eating alone," she mumbled, less emotional but still withdrawn.

Nathan’s gaze dimmed.

Richard cleared his throat. "We won’t force a breakup. Since Damian’s unemployed, let’s bring him into the company. Nathan can assess him properly."

Genevieve gaped. "R-really?"

Nathan nodded. "Evelyn made a valid point. We need full context before advising you."

Joy lit Genevieve’s face. "I’ll call him now! When can he start?"

Their sister’s enthusiasm for another man irked the Blackwood brothers.

"Today. I’ll notify HR," Nathan said tersely before leaving.

Genevieve rushed off, elated.

By brunch, Evelyn learned of the arrangement—and received Genevieve’s tearful gratitude.

My comment was offhand, but Nathan’s approach is surprisingly decent.

At noon, however, wracking sobs echoed from Genevieve’s studio.

Margaret and Evelyn rushed in to find her collapsed in her mother’s arms, weeping uncontrollably.

"Mom, Damian broke up with me! He said Nathan insulted him, that he’s not good enough—"

###Chapter 45

The penthouse suite was eerily silent as Evelyn Sinclair clutched the damning photographs in her trembling hands. Moonlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, casting long shadows across the marble floors where she stood barefoot, the cold seeping into her bones.

How could he?

Her phone buzzed violently against the glass coffee table. Lillian Graves' name flashed across the screen for the seventh time that hour. Evelyn knew her assistant would be frantic - the charity gala started in forty minutes, and the media had already begun speculating about her absence.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Let them speculate. The world thought she was the lucky fiancée of Nathan Blackwood, heir to the Blackwood empire. Only she knew the truth now.

The elevator pinged.

Evelyn didn't turn around as familiar footsteps crossed the threshold. She'd recognize that confident stride anywhere - the slight hesitation in his left foot from an old polo injury. The scent of his cologne - bergamot and sandalwood - filled the space between them.

"Darling?" Nathan's voice was velvet-smooth, the same tone that had charmed investors and socialites alike. "The car's waiting. We're already late."

Slowly, deliberately, Evelyn turned. The photographs fluttered from her grip, scattering across the floor like fallen leaves. Security footage of Nathan entering a boutique hotel. Time-stamped receipts from room service. And the most damning of all - a grainy but unmistakable image of him kissing Victoria Hayes in a shadowed alcove.

Nathan's tan visibly drained. "Evelyn, I can explain—"

"Save it." Her voice was steel wrapped in silk. "Three years, Nathan. Three years of playing the perfect couple while you've been fucking your secretary."

His jaw tightened. "It meant nothing. Just stress relief before the wedding."

The casual cruelty of his words struck like a physical blow. Evelyn's vision blurred momentarily before she forced herself to breathe. Across the room, the grandfather clock ticked ominously.

"You'll call off the engagement," she stated, surprised at how steady her voice sounded. "Tonight. And you'll tell the press it was your decision."

Nathan's laugh was harsh. "Or what? You'll run to the tabloids? My family owns every major outlet in this city."

Evelyn reached into her clutch, withdrawing a slim USB drive. "Or I release these to Serena Whitmore. My agent has connections at the Wall Street Journal. Imagine what these will do to Blackwood Holdings' stock price when they hit before market open."

For the first time in their relationship, genuine fear flickered across Nathan's perfect features. He lunged forward, but Evelyn was already at the elevator, her thumb hovering over the call button.

"Your choice, darling," she purred, throwing his favorite endearment back at him like a dagger. "A clean break now, or financial ruin tomorrow."

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime. As she stepped inside, Evelyn allowed herself one final glance at the man she'd almost married. His usually immaculate hair was disheveled, his tie askew. The great Nathan Blackwood, brought to his knees by his own arrogance.

The doors closed on his furious shout. Only then did Evelyn allow the tears to fall - not from heartbreak, but from the sheer exhilaration of having finally played his game better than he did. Her phone buzzed again. This time, the caller ID made her smile through the tears.

Serena Whitmore. Right on schedule.

Outside, the city lights twinkled like diamonds against the night sky. Somewhere below, paparazzi waited like vultures. Let them. Evelyn Sinclair had a performance to give, and this time, she'd be writing her own script.

Genevieve's tears shattered Margaret's heart. The older woman shot a sharp glance toward the doorway.

Hearing the commotion, Richard was about to intervene.

Seeing his youngest daughter in tears, his hands trembled. "What happened? Nathan would never insult anyone. There must be some misunderstanding."

Tears streamed down Genevieve's face as she sobbed, "Nathan wants Damian to be the company's driver."

For a moment, Richard didn't understand. "What's wrong with that?"

Margaret, however, caught on immediately. "Does Damian look down on the position?"

Choking back tears, Genevieve cried, "Dad, you invited him to join the company, so he prepared seriously—only to be offered a driver's job. You don't know how humiliated and furious he was. He confronted me, asking if I was mocking him. He accused me of toying with his feelings, using this as some twisted way to break up with him. He said I succeeded and told me never to contact him again. Then... he blocked me everywhere. I even reached out to Camille, but she's furious too. She said her brother has never been this upset before. He thinks he's not good enough for me and wants to erase our entire relationship."

She broke down, her voice raw. "Why? Why did you all deceive me? I thought you genuinely wanted to get to know him. Were you trying to sabotage my relationship? Is Damian right? You don't trust me at all, do you? You just want to control my life!"

This was her first heartbreak, and the pain made her words spill out in a jumbled mess. All she wanted was to unleash her anger.

Richard and Margaret were stunned. Genevieve had always been their sweet, obedient child—the easiest to raise. This outburst was unprecedented, leaving them scrambling to soothe her.

They swore they had no ill intentions, and neither did her siblings. It had to be a misunderstanding.

Watching Genevieve sob uncontrollably, Evelyn felt awkward. Just that morning, the younger girl had been thanking her, sharing pastries as a token of gratitude, excited for the future.

How had everything collapsed so suddenly?

Had Evelyn not seen the breakup in the Gossip System, she wouldn’t have believed it.

Damian was furious—shouting at Genevieve as if he’d been gravely insulted.

Evelyn re-examined the situation from Nathan’s perspective and nearly scoffed.

I almost fell for Damian’s tantrum. What’s his problem?

Genevieve, mid-sob, stiffened at Evelyn’s thoughts. Being dumped was painful enough, but hearing someone criticize Damian to her face? Even the gentlest soul would snap.

Richard and Margaret, sensing trouble, immediately restrained Genevieve. They knew Evelyn must have uncovered something damning—perhaps they didn’t even need Nathan’s explanation to understand the truth.

Evelyn thought, Damian did attend the interview expecting grandeur, and Nathan did inform HR. But HR never imagined the CEO’s recommendation would be... this unqualified. No formal education? Fine. But never holding a real job? That’s alarming. Has he been mooching off others his whole life?

Genevieve, catching fragments of Evelyn’s thoughts, paled. "That’s not true! He’s just... unappreciated! Damian is brilliant, but without a degree, he faced discrimination. No one recognized his worth until now—"

Evelyn barely held back an eye roll. Unappreciated? Please. He has zero skills. If not for his driver’s license, HR would’ve stuck him as a janitor. He doesn’t even meet security guard requirements.

Genevieve turned to Evelyn, desperate. "Bella, please—talk to Nathan. Give Damian a real chance to prove himself!"

Evelyn hesitated. You want me to vouch for him? Impossible.

Aloud, she said carefully, "Rosie... the driver position at Blackwood Group pays tens of thousands monthly, with top-tier benefits. People fight for that job. Yet Damian called it an insult. Worse—he name-dropped Nathan to HR, demanding if they knew ‘who he was.’"

Her lips thinned. Who does he think he is? Some spoiled heir? Even nepotism has limits. If Blackwood Group operated like that, it would’ve collapsed years ago.

Evelyn sighed inwardly. Poor Nathan. He humiliated himself at work just to help evaluate his sister’s boyfriend. This’ll damage his reputation.

Genevieve, catching every thought, burst into fresh tears. "He just... wants to build a career to earn your approval! You’re all judging him unfairly!"

This time, Richard and Margaret didn’t comfort her. Their expressions darkened.

"Genevieve," Richard said firmly, "this man is unacceptable. Arrogant, delusional, and utterly lacking self-awareness. His character is flawed."

Margaret nodded. "We meant well, but he twisted it. Nathan was right—your values don’t align. You’re not suited for each other."

Genevieve’s breathing turned ragged, her face flushed crimson. "No one understands him! He’s good, I swear! Just... give him one chance. Please, talk to Nathan!"

Evelyn exchanged a glance with her parents.

This wasn’t just a breakup.

This was an intervention.


###Chapter 46

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she stared at her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirror. Today was the day—the final confrontation with Nathan Blackwood. Her fingers trembled slightly as she adjusted the emerald pendant around her neck, the same one he'd given her on their first anniversary.

"Stop overthinking," Lillian Graves chided, handing her a steaming cup of chamomile tea. "You look like you're preparing for war, not a business merger."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "With Nathan, it's always both."

Across the city, Nathan stood by his office window, his sharp gaze fixed on the skyline. The Blackwood-Grayson merger was hours away, but his mind was elsewhere—specifically, on the woman who'd walked out of his life six months ago.

"Sir," Marcus Donovan interrupted, holding out a file. "Victoria Hayes just leaked internal documents to the press. The board is demanding answers."

Nathan's jaw tightened. Of course she had. Victoria had been a thorn in his side since Evelyn left, seizing every opportunity to undermine him. "Damage control. Now."

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a notification—an anonymous tip about Nathan's alleged involvement in corporate espionage. Her stomach twisted. This wasn't just a smear campaign; someone was playing them both.

At the merger venue, tension crackled in the air. Reporters swarmed as Evelyn stepped out of her car, her crimson dress a bold contrast to Nathan's monochrome suit. Their eyes locked—years of love and betrayal flashing between them.

"Evelyn," he murmured, close enough that only she could hear. "Whatever you're planning, don't."

She smiled coolly. "Who says I'm the one with the agenda?"

Just as the signing began, the screens flickered to life, broadcasting footage of Victoria admitting to framing Nathan. Gasps filled the room. Nathan's expression darkened—he hadn't authorized this.

Evelyn leaned in. "Surprise. I had my own ace."

Before he could respond, the fire alarm blared. Chaos erupted as the crowd stampeded toward exits. In the commotion, Evelyn vanished—leaving Nathan with a single text:

"Game on."

Despite doting on their daughter, Richard and Margaret held firm to their principles when it came to serious matters.

"Genevieve," Richard said sternly, "Blackwood Group's hiring standards can't be bent for anyone's sake. Nathan has already made enough allowances for this boy. When Evelyn joined Blackwood Group, she only set up a small studio under a subsidiary, responsible for her own profits and losses. No one pulled strings to hand her major entertainment investments. If she were truly leveraging her position as the CEO's wife, why would she still be stuck doing photoshoots as a D-list model?"

Evelyn mused, Well, I suppose that’s a backhanded compliment? He wasn’t wrong—she did rely on her looks to make a living. Without any real professional skills, she couldn’t possibly take on serious projects. Still, she had always been professional during her shoots and never tarnished the company’s reputation.

"Don’t reach beyond your grasp. What’s wrong with being a driver? He knows nothing, yet he dreams of overnight success? Why can’t he understand that things must be earned step by step?" Margaret said firmly.

Evelyn thought, If Damian had been the type to work his way up, he’d have experience by now. But no—his constant hunger for shortcuts is exactly what landed him here.

She couldn’t help but scoff internally. Honestly, she believed Damian was utterly incompetent, and breaking up was the best thing that could’ve happened.

Listening to everyone’s harsh words, Genevieve seemed to have run out of arguments to salvage the situation. Unable to bear it any longer, she burst into tears and fled to her room, locking herself inside.

When Nathan found out Damian had ultimately refused the job, he called Evelyn to check on Genevieve.

Evelyn relayed the events plainly.

Nathan, however, didn’t react. "Understood," was all he said.

Evelyn felt a pang of sympathy for him. He’d only tried to intervene a little in his sister’s affairs, yet he’d ended up tangled in unnecessary drama.

"Anyway, Mom and Dad both blame Damian. Just focus on your work. Don’t worry about it anymore."

There was a brief silence on the other end. "I’m not bothered. This outcome was expected."

Evelyn wasn’t sure if she imagined it, but she could’ve sworn she heard a faint trace of amusement in his voice.

Was this all part of his plan? Did he deliberately intimidate Damian into backing down? She never expected Nathan to be so cunning.

By nightfall, Genevieve still hadn’t left her room.

The group gradually returned and learned about the day's events.

Julian let out a mocking laugh.

"Breaking up without even hearing an explanation just proves how stubborn he is. Genevieve has been sheltered her whole life—she's too easily swayed by others. If that guy hadn’t looked down on being a driver, she wouldn’t have thought twice about it. Honestly, the breakup is for the best. Give her some time, and she’ll get over it. Later, I’ll introduce her to some hot actors. She can take her pick—bad boys, sweethearts, you name it. Any of them would be better than that loser."

Evelyn’s eyes suddenly sparkled with realization, excitement bubbling up inside her. She rattled off a list of names to Julian. "Can I pick too?"

Her mind raced with fantasies—A shy, boyish type… A brooding, intense one… Oh my!

Julian frowned. Wait, I’m choosing for my sister, not her. Why is she so hyped?

A sudden chill swept through the room. Julian glanced over and, sure enough, Nathan’s expression had darkened.

"What are you doing?" Julian asked, voicing Nathan’s unspoken question.

"I’ve been binge-watching their dramas lately—they’re gorgeous. Seeing them in person would be eye candy," Evelyn said, grinning.

Sophia, who had also watched the shows, nodded in agreement.

Julian scoffed. "With me and Nate around, you seriously need to gawk at other men?"

"It’s about variety," Evelyn deadpanned.

No matter how handsome you two are, what’s the point? The real fun is teasing the shy, uptight ones until they blush. These guys have already flaunted their abs on screen—who knows, maybe I’ll even get to touch them!

The more she thought about it, the wider her grin grew.

Sophia cleared her throat. "Ahem. I’m going upstairs to check on Genevieve."

Julian followed. "Me too. That brat skipped dinner—is she sulking?"

They moved so fast, Evelyn barely had time to react.

Wait, we didn’t even decide which cute guys to invite to cheer her up!

When she turned, Nathan was staring at her, his expression unreadable—but his gaze was sharp enough to cut glass.

Without thinking, Evelyn blinked and hurried after the other two.

Margaret stepped forward, glancing at Nathan sideways. "Even if we’re being fair, can you honestly say you’re not at fault? Don’t blame Evelyn. What kind of husband won’t let his wife touch him? She has no choice but to find substitutes."

Nathan: What? I never said anything! She never even tried! How does she know I’d refuse?

His thoughts spiraled into chaos.

Upstairs, Evelyn found Julian fuming outside Genevieve’s door.

"Look, I just don’t like that guy. I’m completely against you two being together."

A muffled, desperate voice shot back from inside. "You—just because your own relationship failed, you can’t stand to see others happy! I bet you’re not even good enough for Celeste!"

Sophia couldn’t hold back. "Honestly, I wasn’t a fan of you two either. It’s not about being materialistic, but in a society like ours, it’s rare to find a man who can handle a woman being better than him."

Her expression darkened as she recalled someone. "If you two stayed together, he’d eventually face criticism. And in the end, he’d probably take it out on you to protect his fragile ego."

The moment she , Genevieve burst out, "Sophia, you can’t judge everyone based on your own bad experience!"

Sophia countered, "But judging by his behavior today, he’s clearly not the type to control his emotions. He wasn’t willing to swallow his pride for you."

"You were too harsh on him! You’re not the one dating him—I am! Didn’t you give your all in your past relationship? Why is it wrong when I do the same?"

Sophia fell silent.


Evelyn weighed the options in her mind—Sophia versus Genevieve. Genevieve came out on top.

Sophia and Julian both turned to look at Evelyn, their expressions unreadable. Then, as if by some silent agreement, they gestured for her to step in.

Evelyn thought, I don’t want to get involved. First love makes people irrational—obsessing over every little thing, and no amount of reasoning can change that. Besides, it was Damian who ended things. With his pride, he’d never reconsider. What’s the point in comforting her when the outcome is already set?

Just then, Genevieve’s muffled sobs echoed through the door.

Sophia and Julian exchanged glances—Genevieve versus Evelyn? Evelyn wins.

For the next week, Genevieve stayed home, nursing her broken heart in solitude. Though still deeply upset, she wasn’t one to hold grudges and had already made peace with her family. But reconciliation with Damian? Not a chance. When the new semester began, she reluctantly packed her bags and returned to her dorm.

A month later, while enjoying her afternoon tea in the garden, Margaret received a call.

"Hello? Oh, Professor Holloway! It’s been a while. What’s wrong?" Margaret’s cheerful expression darkened instantly. "What? Genevieve withdrew from the international exchange program? That can’t be—we never heard a word about this!"

"Alright, I understand," Margaret said hurriedly. "I’ll talk to her. Thank you for letting me know, Professor Holloway."

Without wasting another second, she dialed Genevieve’s number.

Sophia hovered nearby, equally anxious. That program had been the sole reason Genevieve chose that university in the first place. No matter how tough things got, she’d fought to stay at the top of her class. How could she just give up the chance to study at that prestigious overseas arts academy?

When the call connected, a man’s voice answered.

Margaret frowned. "Who is this? This isn’t Genevieve’s number."

"Wait—this is my daughter’s phone, isn’t it?"

Genevieve had assigned famous paintings as caller IDs for family members, making it impossible for outsiders to recognize them.

Before Margaret could respond, the line went dead.

Panic set in. Had something happened to Genevieve?

Evelyn’s thoughts raced. What the hell? I look away for five minutes and suddenly there’s a whole drama unfolding? Unbelievable.

Too stunned to react, she didn’t notice Sophia and Julian staring at her.

Evelyn wondered, Has Genevieve actually started keeping secrets from her family? She got back with Damian three weeks ago. The reason she gave up studying abroad? Because he refused to do long-distance. He made it clear—if she left, they were over. So Genevieve chose him.

###Chapter 47

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stood by the window, clutching her coffee cup, her mind replaying last night's disastrous gala. Nathan Blackwood's unexpected appearance had thrown her off balance, and she hated that he still had that effect on her.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Preston Whitmore, the director of her upcoming film. "Evelyn, we need to discuss the reshoots. The studio isn't happy with the chemistry between you and Sebastian Hart." She sighed. Sebastian, her co-star and ex-boyfriend, had been nothing but difficult since filming began.

Before she could reply, another notification popped up—this time from Lillian Graves, her assistant. "Victoria Hayes just leaked your private emails to the press. They're all over social media." Evelyn's stomach twisted. Victoria, Nathan's scheming secretary, had been trying to sabotage her for months.

She scrolled through the headlines, her jaw tightening. "Evelyn Sinclair's Secret Affair with Nathan Blackwood Exposed!" The article included intimate details only someone close to Nathan would know. Evelyn's fingers trembled as she dialed Serena Whitmore, her agent.

"Serena, we need damage control—now."

Serena's voice was calm but urgent. "I'm already on it. But Evelyn... this isn't just Victoria. Someone higher up is pulling strings."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Nathan?"

"Possibly. Or his brother, Julian. He’s never forgiven you for walking away from the Blackwood empire."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Evelyn opened it to find Marcus Donovan, Julian's agent, standing there with a smirk. "Julian wants to see you. Tonight. Alone."

Evelyn's pulse raced. This wasn't a request—it was a threat.

She forced a smile. "Tell Julian I'll be there."

As Marcus left, Evelyn's phone buzzed again. An unknown number. She opened the message, and her blood ran cold.

"You shouldn’t have crossed the Blackwoods, Evelyn. Tonight, you’ll regret it."

The screen went black.

Evelyn clenched her fists. Whatever game Julian was playing, she wouldn’t back down. But as she stared at the ominous message, one thought haunted her: What does Nathan know about this?

And more importantly—whose side was he really on?

The moment Evelyn Sinclair voiced her thoughts, the usually composed Margaret Blackwood and Sophia Blackwood were overcome with fury.

This time, there was no hesitation—no waiting to inform the men at home. Margaret seized Evelyn’s wrist and marched straight toward the university.

As she stepped out of the car at the campus gates, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Genevieve. At least they wouldn’t have to search for her.

Clutching her phone, Margaret’s hands trembled. How could her once-dutiful, level-headed daughter suddenly become so deceitful? It was as if she had transformed into a stranger overnight. Who could accept such a drastic change?

Sophia snatched the phone and switched it to speaker, instantly drawing Evelyn’s attention as she leaned in curiously.

"Mom, were you looking for me?"

Evelyn thought, Her voice is eerily calm. She’s been completely brainwashed. Naturally, this version of Genevieve was even more unacceptable to her mother and sister.

"Who answered your phone just now?" Margaret demanded bluntly.

"A male classmate."

"Which one?"

"Mom, what’s with the interrogation?" Genevieve’s tone carried a sharp edge, as if she resented her mother’s controlling nature. She had no idea Evelyn had already exposed her.

"You—" Margaret’s anger simmered dangerously.

"Gen, where are you right now?" Sophia cut in sharply.

"Soph? I—I’m in the university’s art studio."

Evelyn smirked internally. Liar. Guilty much? Probably on a date with Damian. Let’s see…

Sophia’s voice turned icy. "We’re outside your campus. If you’re really in the art studio, get to Professor Holloway’s office in ten minutes. We’ll be waiting."

"Soph!" Genevieve’s composure shattered instantly. The mention of Beatrice Holloway confirmed her secret was out. "How—how could you just show up without telling me?"

"And how could you keep this from us?" Sophia shot back, her tone laced with the authority of an elder sister. "Ten minutes. Don’t be late."

She hung up and guided Margaret into the campus.

Evelyn mused, She won’t make it in time.

Sophia suspected Genevieve was off-campus, likely on a date. The realization only deepened her disappointment.

Then, Evelyn’s trailing thoughts reached them again.

She’s cleaning up her rented apartment.

Margaret and Sophia froze, exchanging horrified glances.

It wasn’t hard to guess—it had to be Damian’s place. Normally, at this hour, Genevieve would be in her studio, paintbrush in hand, lost in her art, oblivious even to smudges on her face.

What is she doing now?

Evelyn’s inner voice dripped with disdain. Has she lost her mind?

Margaret and Sophia thought in unison, Clearly. Love has made her reckless.

But the next moment, they realized how naïve they’d been. If Evelyn declared someone insane, the situation was far worse than they imagined.

Evelyn’s thoughts dropped like a bomb. Turns out, Genevieve didn’t just reconcile with Damian—she moved out of the dorms and is living with him!

The revelation was staggering.

Margaret’s legs buckled.

"Mom!" Sophia gasped, lunging forward to steady her.

Evelyn, who had been idly observing through the system, quickly stepped in to help.

Who knew Genevieve’s refusal to study abroad would hit Margaret this hard? If she finds out it was all for that loser—that they’re back together and living together—she might collapse right here.

Margaret was indeed overwhelmed, her voice shaking as she gripped Sophia’s arm. "Go… go to Gen’s dorm. Pack her things. She’s coming home."

Evelyn nodded approvingly. Good call. Margaret must sense something’s off. She needs to take Genevieve home and set her straight.

Sophia’s face was ghostly pale with fury. She handed Margaret over to Evelyn and stormed off with the driver, determined to drag Genevieve back by any means necessary.

Meanwhile, Evelyn escorted Margaret to meet Beatrice Holloway, a sharp-eyed professor who had taken a special interest in Genevieve’s talent. Out of respect for the Blackwood family, Beatrice had reached out to Margaret, hoping to talk sense into the girl.

The moment they met, Beatrice began dropping subtle hints, her gaze knowing.

Then Genevieve arrived, her manners flawless as she greeted them. "Mom, Soph, Evelyn, Professor Holloway."

But the expressions staring back at her were anything but welcoming—especially Margaret’s and Sophia’s.

Margaret’s anger had cooled into something far more dangerous—a quiet, seething fury. "So, you’re throwing away the dream you’ve chased for years… for him?"

Genevieve paled. Before she could speak, Evelyn’s mocking thoughts sliced through the air. Margaret’s already guessed. As a woman, she knows exactly what shatters a strong will—a man’s sweet lies.

Sophia’s voice was brittle. "Gen, I just went to your dorm. Dust everywhere—on your desk, your bed. Did you really think you could hide this? No wonder you haven’t come home in weeks. We thought you were buried in your work. You’ve betrayed us."

"It’s not—I didn’t mean to hide it—"

Evelyn’s inner voice was merciless. When you two got back together, Damian warned you your family would tear you apart. So you obeyed him instead of trusting the people who raised you. Twenty years of family… or one month with a boy? Pathetic.

Genevieve flinched, shame burning her cheeks.

Margaret and Sophia’s faces darkened further.

"After everything that happened last time, you still haven’t learned?" Margaret whispered, her voice raw. "You still believe we’re the villains here?"

Genevieve’s silence was answer enough.

"He's not some street thug. You've all completely misjudged him."

Genevieve's defiant words hung in the air for barely a second before Margaret's palm shot up, trembling with barely restrained fury. Only Sophia's quick reflexes prevented the poised society matriarch from striking her beloved daughter right there in the university hallway.

"Mother, let's handle the paperwork first," Sophia interjected smoothly, though her grip on Margaret's wrist betrayed her tension. "We can deal with Genevieve properly at home."

Tears sprang to Genevieve's wide eyes as she took an involuntary step back. "Mother... you were going to hit me?" Her voice cracked with disbelief. In their privileged world where even Julian had received stern reprimands, Genevieve had always been the golden child who could do no wrong. This sudden shift in her mother's demeanor left her reeling.

Margaret's own eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her raised hand now clenched into a fist at her side. For the first time in her life, she questioned whether she truly knew the daughter she'd raised with such care. The daughter who now defended a man their entire social circle had branded as dangerous.

Professor Holloway cleared her throat, breaking the charged silence. "The scholarship application deadline is tomorrow. Perhaps we should let Miss Blackwood submit her materials first?"

Sophia gave her younger sister a firm nudge toward the administration office. "Go on, don't make this worse."

But Genevieve stood rooted to the spot, her chin lifting stubbornly even as tears tracked down her cheeks. The usually docile socialite showed an unexpected spine, her designer heels planted firmly on the marble floor as if she'd grown roots.

###Chapter 48

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She traced her fingers over the bold title of her latest project—Whispers of the Heart—a romance drama that had already sparked buzz in Hollywood.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathan Blackwood lit up the screen.

"Breakfast at The Velvet Rose? I have something to discuss."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathan had been distant since their last argument, his usual warmth replaced by clipped conversations and guarded glances. She typed a quick reply.

"Be there in twenty."

The Velvet Rose was an upscale café tucked between high-end boutiques, its marble tables and crystal chandeliers a favorite among the elite. Nathan sat at their usual corner booth, his dark hair slightly tousled, his sharp jawline accentuated by the morning light.

Evelyn slid into the seat across from him. "You look tired."

He exhaled, rubbing his temple. "Long night."

She studied him—the tension in his shoulders, the way his fingers drummed restlessly against the table. "What’s going on?"

Nathan hesitated, then met her gaze. "Victoria Hayes is pushing for a last-minute script change."

Evelyn stiffened. Victoria, Nathan’s cunning secretary, had been a thorn in her side since day one. "What kind of change?"

"More screen time for Seraphina Delacroix."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her coffee cup. Seraphina—a second-tier actress with connections—had been angling for a bigger role since filming began. "That wasn’t part of the deal."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "I know. But the studio’s backing her."

A cold knot formed in Evelyn’s stomach. This wasn’t just about the script. It was a power play—one that threatened to derail everything she’d worked for.

She leaned forward, voice low. "You promised me creative control."

His eyes flickered with something unreadable. "Things are complicated."

"Then uncomplicate them."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Nathan opened his mouth to respond when his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, jaw tightening. "I have to take this."

Evelyn watched as he stepped outside, his broad frame silhouetted against the glass doors. Something was wrong. Worse than she thought.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, texted her:

"Just got word. Seraphina’s been seen leaving the studio head’s office. Twice."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

This wasn’t just a script change.

This was a war.

And she wasn’t about to lose.

Evelyn Sinclair hadn’t anticipated Genevieve’s stubbornness to persist even now. Staring at her sister-in-law in disbelief, she exhaled sharply. "Are you truly willing to throw away your future—your gift—for a man who won’t even stand by his promises?"

Genevieve’s chin lifted defiantly, though tears streaked her cheeks. "Talent doesn’t vanish just because I stay. I can achieve greatness here—I don’t need to leave the country to prove myself!"

Sophia Blackwood’s eyes narrowed. "Tell me, Genevieve—have you picked up a brush at all these past weeks?"

A flush of shame darkened Genevieve’s face.

Beatrice Holloway, the renowned professor, sighed. "Genevieve, talent alone isn’t enough. It demands cultivation—time, resources, sacrifice. I thought you understood that."

Evelyn bit back a scoff. Oh, the old Genevieve did. But this version? She’s parroting Damian’s empty reassurances like gospel.

Genevieve’s fists clenched. "You don’t understand! Dominic—Damian—loves me. He believes in me!"

Nathan’s mother, Margaret, pinched the bridge of her nose. "And what has he sacrificed for you?"

"Everything!" Genevieve’s voice cracked. "He swallowed his pride to reconcile after what happened—that’s love!"

The room fell into stunned silence.

Beatrice, desperate to defuse the tension, leaned forward. "Genevieve, love shouldn’t cost you your dreams. The right person would never ask you to dim your light."

"But he’s not asking! I’m choosing this!"

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Pfft. Julian moved countries for the woman he loved—twice—without demanding she abandon her ambitions. That’s love. What you’re describing? That’s control."

Genevieve whirled on her. "You’ve always looked down on us! Just because your relationship is perfect—"

"Enough!" Sophia’s voice cut like ice. "We’re done here."

The car ride home was suffocating. Genevieve fled to her room the moment they arrived, slamming the door.

Margaret’s hands trembled. "I should confiscate her phone. Cut her off from that boy."

Sophia shook her head. "It won’t help. She’s in too deep."

Evelyn retreated to her balcony, the night air crisp. A crumpled paper—gold-edged, like an application form—landed at her feet.

She picked it up, heart sinking. The scholarship.

From the adjacent balcony, Genevieve’s muffled sobs drifted through the dark.

Evelyn closed her eyes. God help her.

###Chapter 49
The first one who couldn't stay silent was Julian.

"Damn it! I knew that bastard was no good! And you actually moved in with him? What the hell were you thinking?" Julian was so furious he was practically shouting at Genevieve.

Even as Genevieve paled under his outburst, he didn't relent.

"Tell me the truth," Julian demanded, his voice sharp with anger. "When you two were living together, did he touch you?"

An uncomfortable tension settled over the room. Even Margaret and Sophia, who had known about the cohabitation, had never pressed for details.

Logically, Julian knew he shouldn’t pry into his sister’s private life, but the mere thought of that lowlife laying a finger on Genevieve made him sick to his stomach—like he might vomit up the Christmas feast he'd eaten three years ago.

Genevieve’s face burned with humiliation, but she lifted her chin stubbornly. "We had separate rooms. Damian respects me. He promised he wouldn’t cross any lines before marriage. He just wanted to be close to me. He’s a good man!"

She was an adult, after all. What happened between her and her boyfriend was none of their business. Half her college friends weren’t even virgins anymore. Compared to them, Damian’s restraint was proof of how much he valued her.

Her answer left the room in stunned silence.

On the surface, it should have been a relief. But everyone knew what a man usually expected when he convinced a woman to move in with him.

Julian’s first instinct was to call her a liar.

Then, Evelyn’s quiet, incredulous thought cut through the tension.

Wait… she’s telling the truth? That’s… weird.

The expressions around the room shifted in unison. Seriously? That doesn’t make sense. That punk had no problem groping a girl’s thigh in broad daylight, but he kept his hands to himself when they were alone?

He’s a young guy. Full of hormones. Living together and nothing happened? Is there something wrong with him? Let me check…

Unable to resist, Evelyn dug into the gossip, her curiosity burning.

The subtle shift in everyone’s expressions made Genevieve’s face flush even deeper.

That wasn’t the case. There had been moments—times when Damian held her, and she’d felt him.

But she wasn’t about to admit that to her brother.

The moment was abruptly shattered by Camille's interruption. Otherwise, who knows what might have happened?

While Evelyn couldn't confirm whether Damian had... performance issues, she did uncover something far more shocking. Oh my God!

The sudden outburst sent everyone's hearts racing, their breaths hitching in unison. The room fell into stunned silence.

Even Genevieve, who wasn't entirely familiar with Evelyn's sharp observations, felt a prickle of unease. Recalling Evelyn's earlier skepticism, Genevieve had always wondered—how could anyone dislike someone as seemingly perfect as Damian?

Just as she was lost in thought, Evelyn's incredulous voice cut through the air.

No way. Is Genevieve blind, or just plain stupid?

Genevieve froze, stunned by the accusation.

Evelyn's thoughts spilled out in rapid succession. Damian told Genevieve he treated her well. He said, "Look at other couples. The girlfriends cook, clean, hand over their paychecks—that’s what a good woman does. But you? You're my princess. I don’t care if you never grow up. Stay innocent forever." And like an idiot, Genevieve fell for it! Then he had the nerve to say, "You ruined my favorite jersey even though I only asked you to hand-wash it. What kind of woman doesn’t know how to do laundry? But I’m not mad. I’ll wash them myself. Where else would you find a man who spoils you like I do?" And what did Genevieve do? She apologized and thought it was sweet! Disgusting. I can’t even—my brain cells are dying just listening to this.

Around her, the others' expressions shifted like traffic lights, their gazes locked onto Genevieve with a mix of disbelief and morbid fascination.

Genevieve stiffened. She had always found Damian’s words endearing—until Evelyn threw them back at her with dripping sarcasm. A wave of humiliation crashed over her.

Something felt wrong, but what burned hotter was the indignation on Damian’s behalf.

"He—he really—" Genevieve’s voice trembled.

Julian couldn’t take it anymore. He jabbed a finger at her. "You’re a hopeless romantic!"

"I’m not!" she protested.

"Oh, right," Julian scoffed. "That term’s for people who are actually loved back. Since that’s not you, you’re just dumb." He crossed his arms. "Mom nearly died giving birth to you. Did she leave your brain behind in the delivery room?"

Genevieve, no match for Julian’s sharp tongue, faltered. Tears welled in her eyes. "No! He loves me. What about all of you? Have you ever—"

The siblings exchanged glances. Richard and Margaret looked ready to intervene.

Evelyn sighed internally. This family’s naivety must be genetic. Nathan, Sophia, and Julian have already been played. Now Genevieve’s next. I wonder if their parents were this gullible when they were young…

Richard’s voice turned icy. "Enough. Once the transfer application is filled out, it’s being submitted tonight."

"I don’t want to," Genevieve blurted.

Richard’s eyes narrowed. "What did you say?"

"I’m not leaving," she insisted, defiance flaring. "I already tore up the form."

Richard inhaled sharply. "You—you—"

Julian snorted. "Did that con artist perform a lobotomy on you?"

Genevieve clamped her mouth shut.

Then Nathan spoke. "Fine."

Just as Evelyn debated revealing where the crumpled form was hidden, Nathan’s voice cut in—

A sharp voice cut through the tension.

All eyes snapped to Nathan Blackwood, who had finally broken his silence.

Genevieve's breath hitched as she whispered, "Nate... you're really going to let me do this?"

His expression remained unreadable. "I'm not letting you do anything," he said coolly. "Your life is yours to ruin. If you’ve made up your mind, then face the consequences. Just don’t come crying to us later when it all falls apart."

A cold dread slithered down Genevieve’s spine. For the first time, she felt the weight of her choices pressing down on her—like sand slipping through her fingers, impossible to grasp.

The rest of the Blackwood family exchanged knowing glances. They understood Nathan’s game.

Youthful mistakes always came with a price.

And thanks to the Blackwood name, that price wouldn’t destroy her—but it would leave a scar. A permanent reminder of her recklessness.

Three days into her self-imposed isolation, someone finally came knocking.

###Chapter 50

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she clutched the damning photograph in her trembling hands. The image of Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Hayes locked in a heated embrace outside a luxury hotel sent a sharp pang through her chest.

How could he?

Her phone buzzed—another message from Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant.

Lillian: Evelyn, the board meeting starts in an hour. You need to be there.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, tossing the photo onto her marble coffee table. She had spent years building Sinclair Media from the ground up, only for Nathan to betray her trust so carelessly.

Across town, Nathan adjusted his cufflinks in the mirror of his penthouse suite, his mind still replaying last night’s disastrous encounter with Victoria. She had ambushed him outside the gala, her calculated embrace timed perfectly for the paparazzi lurking nearby.

His phone rang—Julian, his younger brother.

Julian: You’ve seen the headlines, right?

Nathan gritted his teeth. Of course. The tabloids had wasted no time splashing the scandal across their front pages.

Nathan: It’s not what it looks like.

Julian: Tell that to Evelyn.

Nathan’s stomach twisted. He had to fix this—before Evelyn made a decision he’d both regret and deserve.

At Sinclair Media’s headquarters, Evelyn strode into the boardroom, her heels clicking sharply against the polished floor. The room fell silent as she took her seat at the head of the table.

Victoria Hayes smirked from across the room, her crimson lips curling in triumph.

Evelyn met her gaze, unflinching.

Evelyn: Let’s begin.

The battle lines were drawn.

Meanwhile, Sophia Blackwood paced her living room, her phone pressed to her ear.

Sophia: Nathan, you need to fix this. Now.

Her husband, Daniel Prescott, watched her with concern.

Daniel: What’s going on?

Sophia shook her head. Nothing good.

Back at the office, Lillian handed Evelyn a sealed envelope.

Lillian: This just arrived for you. Marked urgent.

Evelyn tore it open, her breath hitching as she scanned the contents.

A single line stood out in bold print:

"Victoria Hayes is working with Preston Whitmore to take over Sinclair Media."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the paper.

This wasn’t just a betrayal.

It was war.

Nathan’s car screeched to a halt outside Sinclair Tower. He had to see Evelyn—to explain before it was too late.

But as he stepped into the lobby, his phone buzzed with a notification.

Breaking News: Sinclair Media CEO Evelyn Sinclair announces emergency shareholder meeting amid scandal.

Nathan’s heart sank.

He was already too late.

The Blackwoods made no move to seek out Damian. After all, he hadn’t earned that privilege yet.

But what they never anticipated was Nathan escorting someone inside—Camille.

Night had fallen, and the entire family was gathered in the grand hall. One by one, their gazes locked onto the unexpected visitor.

Camille was undeniably pretty, carrying herself with a poised elegance that would put any parent at ease. The kind of girl you’d trust around your children.

Once, the Blackwoods had doted on her, showering her with gifts. But ever since Damian started dating Genevieve, their warmth had turned to ice.

Now, she stood awkwardly under their collective scrutiny, the hostility palpable.

Among the stares, one burned particularly sharp. That must be Genevieve’s sister-in-law, Camille thought. Though I’ve never met her, the way she’s looking at me… it’s unsettling. Her eyes are almost… vacant.

Margaret had been about to offer some stern words from a mother’s perspective when Genevieve’s hurried footsteps interrupted.

“Cam!”

“Gen!”

Their bond was unmistakable—tight as sisters.

Julian didn’t hold back. “The girlfriend’s fighting tooth and nail for this sham of a relationship, and the boyfriend’s too cowardly to show his face? Sending his sister instead? Pathetic.”

Genevieve immediately defended, “I told him not to come! Don’t blame Damian.”

Camille bit her lip. “I just wanted to check on Gen. Damian’s worried too, but he didn’t want to upset you all further. He knows he messed up by moving Gen in without your permission. But he adores her. That’s why he acted impulsively. I’m here to apologize on his behalf.”

She bowed deeply.

The Blackwoods had no intention of making Camille’s visit harder than it already was, so they let it slide.

Genevieve quickly whisked Camille upstairs to her room.

Downstairs, Julian kept mocking Damian’s spinelessness. He was the only one who’d crossed paths with the guy. According to Julian, Damian might look respectable, but his slimy demeanor screamed con artist.

Yet, for some reason, good girls always fell for these bad boys.

The Blackwoods sighed in unison. How had it come to this?

Evelyn, seated quietly on the couch, had been unusually silent since Camille’s arrival.

It wasn’t until Nathan handed her a yogurt that he noticed her deepening frown. “What’s wrong?”

Her lips twitched. She glanced at him, then at the others. “Nothing.”

Her tone was light, but her expression was anything but. The family exchanged uneasy looks. Something’s off. That look… it’s ominous.

Evelyn’s thoughts raced. How do I break this to them? Maybe I should just tighten security. That might solve everything.

The family tensed. Security? What’s she not telling us?

Then it hit Evelyn like a truck. Oh, this is rich. All this time, we thought the punk was manipulating our sweet Genevieve. But the real snake? Her best friend.

The Blackwoods stiffened. Wait—what?

Nathan’s gaze sharpened.

Just then, footsteps echoed from upstairs. Genevieve was seeing Camille out.

Now, the family’s stares turned downright suspicious.

Camille fidgeted under the scrutiny. As she turned to leave, Nathan dropped a bombshell.

“Genevieve gave up her spot in the international exchange program. Rumor has it, you’re next in line.”

Evelyn’s eyes flicked to him, impressed. Sharp.

The family’s glares intensified. So that’s the game.

Camille feigned innocence. “I did try to talk her out of it. But since I was next on the list…”

Julian scoffed. “How convenient. Tell me, was this your plan all along? Your brother seduces our sister, and you swoop in for her spot?”

Exactly, Evelyn thought. But it’s not just about the exchange program…

Genevieve paled, her gaze darting to Evelyn. Why does everyone take her word as gospel?

Camille, however, remained unshaken. She clasped Genevieve’s hand. “The exchange thing is a coincidence. I get why you’re wary of me—because of Damian and Gen. But his feelings are real. He loves her. He wants to spend his life making her happy. Can’t you give them that chance?”

Julian’s outburst had gone unchallenged, signaling the family’s collective stance.

Camille’s eyes gleamed as she squeezed Genevieve’s hand. Made your choice yet?

Genevieve’s voice trembled. “Why can’t you just let us be happy?” Tears welled.

Camille pulled her close, the picture of solidarity against their “cruel” family.

Then Genevieve dropped her own bomb.

“You don’t know everything. When I was researching abroad, if Damian hadn’t saved me, I could’ve—”

“What?” Richard and Margaret blanched. “What happened?”

Genevieve launched into her tale—how she’d once been so absorbed in her art that she’d forget to eat, often passing out from hunger. One night, she’d collapsed in the studio. Damian had carried her back to her dorm.

“When I woke up,” she whispered, “the room smelled like home. He’d cooked for me. Three dishes, soup—everything. He’d never cooked before, but he did it for me. After that, he made sure I never skipped a meal. He cares. If I lose him, who’ll ever love me like that?”

Julian rolled his eyes. “Our chefs make seven-course meals daily.”

“It’s not the same,” Genevieve insisted. “His food was made with love. You wouldn’t understand.”

Sophia cut in, voice tight. “Remember when Mom tried cooking? You got food poisoning. We banned her from the kitchen after that. And now you’re swooning over this?”

The family’s accusatory stares made Genevieve waver.

Then Evelyn’s silent laughter echoed in her mind.

Oh, this is priceless. She’s ready to elope over takeout. Damian didn’t cook—he ordered in and plated it. And she bought it. Hook, line, and sinker.

###Chapter 51

The room plunged into an unsettling silence the moment those words were spoken.

The Blackwoods nearly jumped from the couch in unison. Elope?

Evelyn Sinclair sensed the ripple of shock coursing through those seated beside her. Yet when she glanced around, everyone remained frozen, their gazes locked onto Genevieve—stunned by the sheer absurdity of what she had just proposed.

Genevieve’s face twisted in confusion. She hadn’t expected Evelyn to somehow know about the half-formed plan that hadn’t even been finalized yet.

She didn’t actually want to elope. The thought terrified her. But Camille had kept pushing, whispering in her ear, and she had wavered.

Genevieve still hoped to convince her family, but their earlier refusal had shaken her resolve.

She had thought—if she acted recklessly, if she forced their hand—they would have no choice but to accept Damian. Once they did, they wouldn’t lock her away or send her abroad. And with time, they’d see he wasn’t the monster they believed him to be.

But now, under the weight of their disbelieving stares, shame burned through her. She barely registered Evelyn’s next thought.

Unaware of the tension, Camille nudged Genevieve, unwilling to let this naive girl back down now.

That single movement caught Evelyn’s attention.

Ah, so the food delivery was actually ordered by that deceitful best friend of hers. The idiot only knew how to microwave it and pretend he cooked it—trying to fool Genevieve when she woke up. Evelyn smirked inwardly.

Genevieve’s mind spun. No! That can’t be true! That moment wasn’t fake!

She had sworn she could taste the love in that meal. For that, she really should thank the chef at that cheap Clusian takeout chain. Three dishes and a soup for under thirty bucks—what a bargain! Evelyn mused.

Genevieve’s eyes widened. As much as she wanted to deny it, Evelyn’s thoughts were too detailed to dismiss.

I should order from that place every day while she’s home. Let her taste that “love” for a month straight. See if she doesn’t get sick of it.

Genevieve swayed, barely keeping herself upright.

Camille steadied her, putting on a sorrowful expression. “Please stop tormenting Gen,” she pleaded. “Maybe to you, Damian cooking for her means nothing. But it was a gesture straight from his heart. He’s never done that for anyone else.”

Ha! Of course he hasn’t—because he can’t even boil water! Evelyn scoffed internally.

Camille continued, righteous fury burning in her voice. “Even if you dislike him, don’t trample on his sincerity.”

Her words were so impassioned, so brave—if not for Evelyn’s inner monologue, the Blackwoods might have actually been fooled.

Nathan Blackwood leaned forward, his dark eyes glinting. “Fine. If you insist, invite your brother over.”

Camille froze. “...What?”

“Let him come here and cook for us. If we feel his sincerity, we won’t stand in their way.”

Oh, Nathan, you genius. Evelyn barely suppressed a laugh. This is going to be hilarious. That girl’s probably sweating bullets now.

Camille paled. Her body locked up, words failing her.

Genevieve clung to her like a lifeline. “Just ask Damian to come. One meal, and we can be together.”

Camille’s voice turned strained. “Gen, you know how he is. He won’t agree.”

“Why not?” Genevieve’s voice cracked. “He cooked for me before. Doesn’t he want this?”

Julian Blackwood let out a cold laugh. “Let me get this straight. When my sister was living with him, it wasn’t insulting for her to wait on him hand and foot. But us asking him to cook one meal is too much? That’s some double standard.”

Richard and Margaret had long stopped paying attention to this farce.

“Do you see now, Gen?” Julian pressed. “He won’t lift a finger to prove himself. Is this the man you chose? Where’s this great love you keep talking about? All talk, no action.”

Margaret’s voice was icy. “He won’t even try to earn our approval. All he cares about is luring you into secret rendezvous, living together—no responsibility, no commitment. In our eyes, he’s not even a real man.”

Then Evelyn’s next thought cut through the tension like a knife.

Ah, true love. She’s so protective. It’s almost… perverted.

Wait—what?

Every head swiveled toward Camille. Her furious, red-eyed glare could be interpreted as sisterly devotion… or something far more twisted.

No way. They wouldn’t… would they?

Genevieve stared in horror, shaking her head. This is insane.

Then Nathan’s calm voice shattered the silence.

“Even though you two are stepsiblings with no blood relation, your bond seems… stronger than most.”

The words landed like a hammer.

The room went deathly quiet.

Nathan’s statement—paired with Evelyn’s thoughts—painted a very disturbing picture.

Margaret’s voice was barely a whisper. “Gen… did you know they weren’t blood-related?”

But Genevieve was beyond responding, her face ghostly pale.

“Why didn’t you mention this sooner?” Richard demanded.

Nathan shrugged. “They grew up together. To outsiders, they seemed like any other siblings.”

Until now.

The Blackwoods finally understood Evelyn’s earlier expression when she saw Camille.

If those two are involved… where does that leave Genevieve?

###Chapter 52

Camille's face paled as beads of sweat formed on her forehead. "W-Why are you bringing this up now? How dare you meddle in private matters!" Her reaction wasn't one of indignation—it was pure guilt.

Julian smirked, his eyes glinting with mischief. "Take a guess."

Camille trembled, her fingers curling into fists.

Evelyn was stunned. Why is Nathan suddenly questioning this? Did he uncover something? She bit her lip. They’ve been so careful. No one should have noticed. Unless...

Nathan, however, felt a pang of embarrassment. I didn’t actually find anything. I should’ve thought this through.

The Blackwood family exchanged glances. No one could have predicted this twisted dynamic.

Poor Genevieve, they thought. She’s been caught in the middle of this deranged sibling affair. Damian and Camille’s relationship wasn’t just complicated—it was forbidden. Though they weren’t blood-related, their upbringing as siblings made their romantic entanglement even more scandalous.

But secrecy wasn’t sustainable. Damian’s family had been pressuring him to settle down, hoping marriage would tame his reckless ways. Camille, unwilling to let another woman take her brother away, had devised a cruel plan—and Genevieve was her unwitting pawn.

A chill settled over the room as all eyes turned to Genevieve.

Her expression was blank, as if she were listening to a stranger’s story. This can’t be real. This can’t be happening to me.

Evelyn’s thoughts raced. Camille targeted Genevieve because she was naive, easy to manipulate. And Damian? He despises obedient rich girls—exactly the type Genevieve was raised to be. Camille knew that. She orchestrated everything, from the meals to the late-night texts. Those sweet nothings Genevieve swooned over? All Camille’s words, sent from Damian’s phone. And the separate bedrooms? Not out of respect—Camille forbade it. She couldn’t stand seeing them together.

A twisted thrill ran through Camille—she got to keep Damian while using Genevieve as both a shield and a stepping stone.

Richard’s voice cut through the tension. "Genevieve, your friend wants to leave. Are you going to let her?"

Camille stiffened. What does that mean?

Genevieve’s face drained of color. Her vacant gaze swept over the room before she turned and walked away, retreating to her bedroom in silence.

The Blackwoods understood her turmoil. Without concrete proof, it was hard to accept the truth. But the doubt had been planted.

Evelyn, ever the provocateur, couldn’t resist pushing further. She ordered three dishes and soup from a high-end restaurant, plating them herself and claiming she’d cooked them to cheer Genevieve up. The staff praised her effort, but the family’s reactions were… telling.

Three days later, Genevieve vanished.

No one knew if it was the shock of the revelations or something else that drove her to flee. Surveillance showed no one had come for her—she hadn’t eloped.

The Blackwoods tracked her quickly but chose not to intervene.

They wanted to see what she would do next.

###Chapter 53

The ordinary residential parking lot was unusually tense as Nathan, Margaret, and Julian—who had rushed back—sat in the car with Evelyn, who was eager to witness the unfolding drama firsthand.

Their eyes were fixed on Genevieve, standing near the entrance, clearly waiting for someone.

She still chose to come see Damian again. Disappointment flickered in Margaret’s and Richard’s eyes.

Julian, ever the calm observer, spoke softly. "Maybe she’s here to confront him. Or to finally get closure."

After all, the look on Genevieve’s face wasn’t one of longing anymore—it was icy detachment.

Between the parking lot and the residential area, clusters of elderly neighbors chatted loudly, their voices carrying like wildfire. True to their reputation as the neighborhood’s most efficient gossip network, nothing escaped their sharp tongues.

Bored, Evelyn half-listened to their mundane chatter—until the conversation took a sharp turn.

The atmosphere in the car turned suffocating.

Because they were now talking about Genevieve.

Genevieve must have sensed it too. Her gaze snapped toward the gossiping crowd.

"What? Did Damian’s mother really say that?"

"Oh, absolutely. She even said whether they actually get married is still up in the air. And she doesn’t care who he brings home—as long as he’s entertained."

"Disgusting. Any girl who ends up with that family is doomed."

"Honestly, any girl who moves in with a man before marriage has no self-respect. If she doesn’t respect herself, why should anyone else?"

"Oh, please. What century are we living in—"

The Blackwoods’ expressions darkened. Hearing the rumors firsthand was like a knife to the heart.

Evelyn studied Genevieve’s face, noting how different she looked now compared to when she had spoken to her family earlier.

"But didn’t Gwendolyn act all sweet with that girl last time? Like she adored her?"

"Pure acting. The second the girl left, she started bragging." The speaker mimicked Gwendolyn’s voice mockingly. "She’s some rich heiress, completely obsessed with my son. Begged to move in with us. But so what if she’s rich? She’ll still have to serve my family. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even let her through the door."

The others cackled—whether at the foolish girl or the delusional mother was unclear.

"Gwendolyn kept saying they’d marry soon. That the girl was desperate, afraid someone else would snatch Damian away. That’s why she moved in—to keep an eye on him."

"Her son is a leech. Handsome, sure, but lazy. Always dreaming big, doing nothing. Who’d even want him?"

"Exactly! And yet she brags about how her son won’t pay a single cent for the wedding. Says the girl’s family will have to fork over a dowry just to make sure he treats her well."

"Oh, I heard worse. The poor girl’s family is expected to pay for Camille’s overseas education, buy them a house, a car, and even get Damian a job!"

"Delusional. Do they think everyone’s an idiot?"

"Well, hard to say. The girl’s already living with him—her reputation’s ruined. If word spreads, she’ll be seen as ‘used goods.’ And if she gets pregnant? Her family will have no choice but to accept this sham."

Three weeks of cohabitation, and the rumors were already spreading like wildfire.

Gwendolyn and Camille had been working overtime to tarnish Genevieve’s name.

Their goal? Trap her.

If Genevieve was foolish enough to elope, she’d be stuck—no way out.

Margaret’s eyes welled up. Richard pulled her close, murmuring, "I should’ve been stricter with her. She grew up too sheltered."

"No, it’s my fault," Margaret choked out. "I protected her too much."

Julian’s jaw tightened. "This isn’t on either of you. Some lessons have to be learned the hard way."

The Blackwoods had given their children everything—wealth, comfort, love. But they hadn’t prepared them for the cruelty of the world.

Now, their expressions hardened.

If Genevieve still chose to be a fool, they wouldn’t hesitate to drag her out themselves.

After all, she’d already given up her future for love—handing her opportunities to her boyfriend’s sister, even paying her tuition.

Utterly senseless.

And if she didn’t wake up now, she deserved what came next.

Genevieve had never noticed the disdain in people’s eyes before.

But today, with one glance, she saw it all—the contempt, the mockery.

It stole her breath.

"Where’s Damian?" she asked, forcing down the bile in her throat.

Camille blinked. Odd. She didn’t call him ‘Dami.’

Still, she answered sweetly, "He heard you were coming and figured you hadn’t eaten. Went home to cook for you. Should be back soon." She leaned in, whispering, "But don’t get any ideas about him cooking for your whole family. That’s beneath him."

Genevieve’s glare was so sharp, Camille instinctively stepped back.

Meanwhile, the Blackwoods spotted a man striding into the hallway, carrying something.

Handsome, yes.

But Evelyn’s lips curled.

Well, well. The trash has finally shown itself.

###Chapter 54

"Genevieve, what's gotten into you?"

.

"I won't be paying a single cent for you. Don’t even think about securing that spot," Genevieve declared, her voice icy.

Camille’s face twisted in shock. "Gen, what are you saying?"

Instantly, Gregory and Gwendolyn tensed up.

Gregory scowled. "Aren’t you my son’s girlfriend? And my daughter’s best friend? What’s wrong with helping out? Why the hostility? If we weren’t in such a rush to gather the funds, we wouldn’t even be asking you. It’s not like we won’t repay you!"

He shot her a disapproving glare. "And you still expect to marry my son with this attitude?"

Gwendolyn chimed in, her tone dripping with condescension. "Gen, we’ve always treated you like family. Are you upset because Damian hasn’t been visiting lately? But you should reflect on your own family’s behavior. If they can’t show basic respect, why should my son bother? Even if you’re angry, sabotaging Camille at such a crucial moment is unacceptable. And to think you call yourselves best friends!"

She smirked, adding, "Throw your tantrums another time, but right now, you need to stop."

What dignity could a woman who moved in with her boyfriend after barely a week of dating possibly have?

Gwendolyn felt utterly in control, already wearing the smug expression of a future mother-in-law.

Genevieve stared at her, her expression rigid. Though she couldn’t muster a fierce glare, the disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.

"The way your son behaves dictates how my family treats him. You expect respect? Tell me—does he deserve it?"

The Campos family froze.

Camille gaped at Genevieve, reaching for her sleeve, only to be roughly shaken off. "I came here today to break up with Damian and retrieve my painting from his apartment—not to be your personal ATM."

Her voice rang out, sharp and clear, echoing through the office and into the hallway.

The four members of the Blackwood family, who had just stepped off the elevator, heard every word.

Everyone stood rooted in shock.

Ah. She’s finally seen the light.

.

Surprise flickered across the Blackwoods’ faces. It was the first time they’d ever heard Genevieve raise her voice like this.

But their relief was short-lived—because Damian chose that exact moment to walk through the door.

They hurried after him.

"Gen, what the hell are you talking about?" Damian demanded, struggling to keep his anger in check.

Genevieve finally looked at him. Once, she’d thought him effortlessly handsome, his rebellious charm intoxicating. She’d believed his devotion was real—that his eyes held only her. It had made her feel invincible.

Now?

Now she saw him for what he truly was: a rude, delusional, self-absorbed fool.

She’d been under a spell, blind to the red flags. But that night, reality had shattered her illusions. Looking back, she couldn’t believe she’d ever fallen for someone so revolting. The mere thought made her stomach churn.

When Damian realized she wasn’t answering, he faltered. In their relationship, he’d always held the upper hand—teasing her, never truly cherishing her.

His gaze flicked to Camille, who subtly gestured for him to placate Genevieve. If this escalated, Camille’s overseas exchange funds would be in jeopardy.

Swallowing his irritation, Damian forced a smile and lifted the lunchbox he was carrying. "Here. You must be hungry. I made this for you. Let’s eat first, then talk."

It was his usual tactic—reminding her of the time he’d "saved" her, making her forget her anger.

This time, Genevieve took the lunchbox.

Then, before anyone could react—

CRASH.

The contents splattered across Damian’s chest.

A scream ripped through the office, drawing even more onlookers.

Damian’s temper evaporated instantly. He knew exactly who he couldn’t afford to offend.

"You’re really testing my patience," Evelyn Sinclair remarked, her smile never wavering. "Shall I order takeout right here so we can compare?"

"This is none of your business!" Gwendolyn snapped.

11:59 AM

Gwendolyn paled.

Camille, realizing they’d been exposed, tried damage control. "Gen, even if Damian lied about cooking, his feelings for you are real. You’ve lived together—you know that, right?"

Evelyn immediately pulled out her phone and started recording.

Others followed suit.

She wasn’t doing this to blackmail Genevieve—she wanted proof before the Campos family spun their own narrative.

Genevieve, now clear-headed, made sure the truth would be undeniable.

"Living together?" she scoffed. "You mean tricking me into being his unpaid caretaker while forbidding intimacy?"

The crowd gasped.

Damian and Camille stared, stunned. The reserved Genevieve they knew would never speak so bluntly.

She stepped forward, her gaze burning into them. "All while you two were sleeping together behind my back."

Her voice dripped with venom.

"You’re disgusting."
###Chapter 55

The words detonated through the office like a grenade, leaving a stunned silence in their wake. Inside and out, the air grew thick with tension—so quiet you could hear a feather drop. Every person in the room froze, their expressions morphing from shock to horrified disbelief.

What had they just heard?

Sleeping together? Disgusting? Them?

The "them" in question was Damian and Camille—but weren’t they siblings?

A collective shudder ran through the crowd as all eyes darted between the two accused and their parents.

Under Genevieve’s blistering accusation, Damian and Camille first went deathly pale, then flushed crimson as if the weight of every judgmental stare was branding their skin.

"Have you lost your damn mind?" Camille shrieked, her voice cracking with hysteria. "You’re so jealous you’ve invented this twisted fantasy! You’re insane!"

Damian’s face twisted in fury. "Genevieve, if you don’t shut your mouth right now, we’re done!"

Genevieve let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "Oh, please. I was dumping you the second I walked in here. The sight of you makes me sick. Jealous? Of you? You’re nothing but sewer rats—filthy, disgusting, pathetic!" Her voice trembled with rage, her knuckles white where she gripped her bag.

Damn. Who knew the quiet artist had this much fire in her?

The shock on Damian and Camille’s faces was almost comical. They hadn’t expected the girl they’d walked all over to finally snap.

Even the Blackwoods—Nathan, Margaret, Richard—stared at Genevieve like she’d grown a second head. Their sweet, soft-spoken daughter had just unleashed hell.

Gregory and Gwendolyn Campos exchanged a fleeting glance of panic before doubling down.

"You lying little brat!" Gregory snarled. "Spreading vile rumors like this—we’ll sue you into oblivion!"

"She’s deranged!" Gwendolyn wailed, clutching her pearls. "How dare she slander my innocent children like this!"

The murmurs in the crowd swelled.

"If this is a lie, it’s beyond cruel. Accusing siblings of that? Unthinkable."

"Some girls get possessive over air if it’s near their boyfriends. Remember how Genevieve used to follow Damian around like a lost puppy? She’s clearly lost it."

"Maybe she’s jealous because they’re close siblings and she’s an only child!"

This wasn’t good. If this kept up, everyone would dismiss Genevieve as delusional. And without proof, her credibility would be shredded.

Margaret and Richard exchanged frantic looks. They knew Genevieve’s outburst came from Evelyn’s thoughts—but they couldn’t exactly announce that in public.

Then Nathan spoke, his voice cutting through the noise like a blade.

"They’re stepsiblings. No blood relation. And yet—" His gaze locked onto Damian. "—when Camille started university, you suddenly rented an apartment near her campus. No stable job, no reason not to live at home. Why?"

The room went dead silent.

That one question—so simple, so logical—shifted everything.

If they’d been blood-related, the idea would’ve been dismissed as absurd. But step-siblings? That was soap opera territory. And the way Damian had followed Camille? Suspicious as hell.

A girl in the crowd snorted. "My real brother wouldn’t cross the street for me. Why’s he so obsessed with his stepsister?"

Inside the Campos family, panic erupted.

Camille’s hands shook. "Y-You have no proof! This is slander! I’ll ruin you!"

But the damage was done. People were looking at them differently now.

Then Genevieve pulled out her phone.

"You forgot," she said coldly. "I record my painting sessions. There’s a hidden camera in that room. Want to see the footage? I can show everyone."

Camille’s face drained of color.

Damian looked like he might vomit.

And the crowd leaned in.

###Chapter 56

All eyes in the room locked onto Genevieve’s phone, buzzing with anticipation.

What a bombshell!

Wait—why does she sound so sure? Is it real? I shouldn’t look… but I can’t resist!

The Blackwood family stood frozen, staring at Genevieve in disbelief. Yet, it was true—she did have surveillance cameras installed in her modest rental studio.

Camille knew about Genevieve’s habit of recording her workspace, but she never expected her to do the same in that tiny apartment. As Genevieve unlocked her phone, Camille’s mind blanked. Panic surged through her, and she lunged forward, desperate to snatch the device away.

Nathan stepped in, blocking her path—only for Damian to seize the moment, darting toward Genevieve with outstretched hands.

In a flash, Genevieve yanked her phone back. With her free hand, she swung—crack!—a sharp slap landed across Damian’s cheek.

Staggering back, Damian barely had time to register the sting before—smack!—another slap followed, leaving him dazed.

The room fell silent.

Nathan, momentarily stunned, failed to react in time, allowing Camille to lunge again. "How dare you hit him!" she shrieked.

Genevieve didn’t hesitate. Slap! Slap! Two more resounding strikes landed on Camille’s face.

Gasps filled the air. Genevieve—the delicate, sweet campus darling, the girl who had been deceived—had just delivered four brutal slaps.

As the red marks bloomed on Damian and Camille’s faces, the room held its breath.

Damn right! Scum deserves worse. Youth is precious—slap that trash harder!

Evelyn couldn’t help but clap. To her surprise, others joined in. Whistles and cheers erupted, praising Genevieve’s boldness.

Genevieve smirked, her voice dripping with mock sorrow. "I was bluffing. But thank you for proving your guilt so convincingly."

The room exploded into laughter.

Camille and Damian glared at her, venom in their eyes—but before they could retaliate, chaos erupted behind them.

Gregory punched his stepson square in the face, then kicked him to the ground. "You dare sleep with my daughter? After everything I’ve done for you? Ungrateful wretch!"

Gwendolyn yanked Camille’s hair, raining slaps on her. "You harlot! You seduced my son! Just like your mother—disgraceful!"

"Dad, stop! Damian, help me!"

"Mom, let her go, you old hag!"

The four of them tumbled into a tangled mess of limbs and screams.

The Blackwoods quickly retreated, shielding Genevieve from the brawl. The office staff, though entertained, had no choice but to intervene.

"This is an exchange student processing center. If you can’t pay, leave. Deadline’s 6 p.m. Don’t make me call security," a staff member snapped.

The warning snapped them back to reality.

"Now I see! You were using my son to secure funds for abroad! Well, dream on!"

"Who says she can’t go? We’ll sell the house if we have to! She needs to get far away from your filthy son!"

"That house is my son’s! He’s the one who’ll care for you in old age! If you give it to her, she’ll abandon you!"

"At least she’s my blood! Unlike your son, who stole from me and preyed on my daughter!"

Gregory and Gwendolyn’s argument escalated, fists nearly flying. Damian watched, seething but unwilling to step in.

Then—Genevieve’s phone lit up.

She typed a message and tilted the screen toward Camille, whose face twisted in suspicion before paling in horror.

The text read: Your brother secretly took me on dates behind your back. He begged me not to tell you.

Evelyn, standing behind Genevieve, caught the message. Her gaze flicked between Damian and Camille, realization dawning.

So that’s why.

Damian had been torn—Genevieve’s allure as a trophy girlfriend overshadowing his years with Camille. He’d been tempted but lacked the guts to act.

Camille, meanwhile, had sworn to repay her father by selling paintings once abroad.

When Julian recounted the fallout to Genevieve, she murmured, "Karma’s real, isn’t it?"

Julian almost nodded—until Evelyn’s thoughts cut in.

No. It was your family stepping in. The Blackwoods don’t suffer fools. Power exists to remind scum of their place.

Genevieve finally smiled.

That evening, she joined dinner, bowing deeply in apology for her foolishness.

Evelyn’s silent verdict: Hopeless in love, but at least she woke up fast.

The Blackwoods coughed awkwardly.

Genevieve turned starry-eyed to Evelyn. "How can I thank you?"

Nathan nearly said it wasn’t necessary—the family had already showered Evelyn with "gifts" (read: divorce fund deposits).

Then Genevieve mused, "She used to adore you. Maybe something tied to you? But she’s changed..."

Nathan stiffened. Et tu, sister?

Sophia’s blunt answer: "She’s over you. Money’s her focus now."

Having survived her own romantic disaster, Genevieve nodded sagely. "Smart woman."

Soon, Evelyn’s phone pinged—a transfer notification.

Thank you for the takeout. It cleared my head. —Genevieve.

The amount? Over two million.

###Chapter 57

Evelyn Sinclair found herself in Nathan Blackwood’s study, pretending to scrutinize the investment reports he had laid out before her. Truthfully, she understood none of it, but she played along, feigning supervision while her attention wandered elsewhere.

Nathan stood nearby, his white bathrobe loosely tied, the chandelier’s glow accentuating the sculpted lines of his torso. His damp hair, dark as ink, framed his sharp features, and every breath he took seemed to ripple with restrained power.

Goodness, the man is a walking temptation. Evelyn mused, biting her lip. Why does he have to look this unfairly attractive outside of his tailored suits? Maybe keeping him around just for the view isn’t such a bad idea.

Nathan, who had been watching her with quiet amusement, stiffened slightly at the sudden shift in her thoughts. Divorce? Again?

But in just two months, Cassandra—his so-called "first love"—was set to return. Evelyn could already envision the drama: the misunderstandings, the tearful confessions, the inevitable heartache. And there she’d be, stuck in the middle like some disposable prop in their tragic romance.

Nathan exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to grab Evelyn by the shoulders and shake some sense into her. If only she’d just look into my memories!

Yes, Cassandra had been his crush, but she was not his first love.

Back in university, he and Cassandra had been drawn to each other’s ambition. She pursued him, and he, indifferent but not opposed, agreed to date. But their relationship had been anything but passionate. Reserved by nature, Nathan had never been one for grand romantic gestures. They attended lectures together, debated theories, and parted ways with nothing more than polite goodbyes.

Yet, Cassandra had spun their dynamic into something far more dramatic, whispering sweet nothings to anyone who would listen. By the time she announced her sudden departure abroad, Nathan had already emotionally checked out.

His subsequent avoidance of relationships had nothing to do with lingering heartbreak and everything to do with the crushing weight of corporate responsibilities. Love was a luxury he couldn’t afford—until Evelyn.

Still, given his pride, he couldn’t exactly grab her and declare, "I never loved her! Stop assuming things!"

He trusted that Evelyn, with her insatiable curiosity, would eventually uncover the truth on her own. Then she’d realize divorce was off the table, and they could finally focus on building something real.

In the meantime, he indulged her whims, hoping to bridge the gap between them.

But Evelyn remained blissfully oblivious, too preoccupied with admiring his physique to notice his internal struggle. Just as she contemplated poking his abs—purely for scientific purposes, of course—her phone buzzed.

"Huh?" She frowned at the screen. "Why is my bank balance suddenly so… decimal-heavy?"

Nathan glanced over, lips quirking. "Serena must have emptied her wallet into your account. She’s locking herself away to focus on her art exams. Consider it her way of eliminating distractions."

"I can’t accept all this!" Evelyn protested, though her fingers flew across the screen, sending a cheerful "Thanks, Rich Lady!" sticker before transferring most of the money to Nathan.

He chuckled. "A little hardship might do her good. Better to struggle now than be deceived by some reckless fool later." His expression softened. "She has real talent, you know."

Evelyn sighed dramatically. If I’d been born wealthy, would I have chased some grand ambition too?

Nah. She smirked. A life of leisure is the ultimate dream. Why strive when you can lounge?

Unfortunately, her lazy fantasies were abruptly interrupted when Julian and Marcus Donovan swooped in, determined to mold her into a "promising artist" before their impending studio relocation.

For three grueling days, Evelyn endured their relentless training. But by the fourth morning—precisely at eight o’clock, when she had just fallen back asleep—Julian’s insistent knocking shattered her peace.

Slumped at the breakfast table, she glared at her salad like it had personally offended her.

Why did I ever agree to this?

Across from her, Julian sighed. "Hurry up. We’re waiting."

Evelyn stabbed a lettuce leaf with unnecessary force. "Why are you even here today?"

Julian smirked. "Because someone has to save you from your own laziness."

Evelyn groaned. This is torture.

But as she glanced around the empty table—Nathan and Sophia had long since left for work—she begrudgingly admitted: They’re not just richer. They’re relentless.

No wonder they were successful.

And no wonder she’d rather nap.
###Chapter 58

Julian barely glanced up from his phone, fingers flying across the screen as he muttered, "What?"

Evelyn smirked, mischief dancing in her eyes. "If I recall correctly, today’s the day Celeste left. Didn’t you go to the airport to see her off?"

Still not looking up, Julian replied flatly, "Their flight was at six. I called you after I dropped them off."

Evelyn’s eyebrows shot up. "Wait—you actually went?"

For weeks, Julian had kept his distance from Celeste, his only visible connection to her being the crescent moon emoji he’d added to his Twitter handle. He’d thrown himself into his work, burying his emotions under spreadsheets and strategy meetings.

But Evelyn knew better. She’d caught wind of his secret visits—always from a distance, never letting Celeste see him.

And now, he’d even upgraded their tickets to first class under the guise of a "corporate sponsorship."

Julian rolled his eyes. Why ask if you already know?

From his hiding spot at the airport, he’d watched Celeste’s usually composed face light up with genuine relief as she stepped toward the boarding gate. The sight had shattered him. He’d ducked into a restroom stall, pressing his palms against his eyes until the sting faded.

"Ahem!" Julian snapped, voice sharp. "Are you done? We have a class to get to."

Shut up. You’re making it worse.

Evelyn bit back a grin. Oh, he’s upset. Probably reliving the moment he realized Celeste was happier leaving than staying. Rumor had it he’d taken an overseas assignment just to avoid accidentally running into her.

Julian’s jaw tightened. I’m not overestimating myself. I just know my presence would ruin her peace.

But deep down, he knew his silent devotion wasn’t some grand romantic gesture. If Celeste ever found out, she wouldn’t be moved—she’d be creeped out.

Julian froze mid-step. He wasn’t trying to win her over. He just… didn’t know how to stop caring.

The ache of watching her slip further away was suffocating.

Evelyn, oblivious to his turmoil,  her meal and sauntered over. Her gaze flicked to his phone screen—a flood of green message bubbles.

Accidentally, she caught a glimpse of Celeste’s profile picture.

Morning greetings. Lunch check-ins. Questions about her day. All unanswered.

"Is this… harassment by text?" Evelyn blurted.

Julian locked his phone with a sharp click. "It’s not her chat."

Evelyn blinked. Wait—

It wasn’t Celeste’s chat.

Julian had created a fake account. And he’d been messaging himself.

Evelyn’s mouth fell open. Is this his way of coping? Writing diary entries to a ghost?

Julian turned away, shoulders stiff, his pace quickening.

He needed an outlet. If he didn’t pour his feelings somewhere, he’d crack and reach out to Celeste for real. And he’d sworn never to make her uncomfortable again.

In reality, the only time he dared contact her was during holidays—and even then, only in group chats.

Pathetic.

Julian bristled. I’m not pathetic!

Evelyn’s voice cut through his thoughts. "Not a hopeless romantic. More like… the king of simps."

Julian’s eye twitched. So what if I am?

One day, Celeste would move on. And all he’d have left were silent tears in the dark.

Karma.

Julian scowled. I could start crying right now if I wanted to.

Exhausted, he dragged Evelyn to the agency, only to be ambushed by Marcus.

Evelyn, sensing drama, flopped onto the couch. "Didn’t you say you were canceling all my work?"

Julian ignored her, turning to Marcus. "What’s this about?"

Marcus grinned. "My Acting Skill."

Julian groaned. He’d expected Evelyn’s refusal—this show was grueling, and she loathed effort.

"I’ll do all the heavy lifting," Julian offered.

Evelyn snorted. "It’s live. If I slack off, your fans will skin me alive."

"Both our appearance fees go to you."

Evelyn jabbed a finger at the contract. "You’re doing this for Isabelle. You’re not getting paid."

Marcus coughed awkwardly.

Julian sighed. "You wanted money, right? Fame equals fortune."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I do want money. But not enough to become public enemy number one."

I’m not some transmigrated protagonist. I’d rather be a rich spectator laughing at others’ drama.

Just as Julian was about to give up, inspiration struck.

"This show is a mess," he said casually. "The first few episodes were semi-live, so the audience missed all the juicy bits."

Evelyn’s head snapped up. "What?"

Julian smirked. "This season? Four couples. All disasters."

Marcus jumped in. "A secretly married A-lister paired with his on-screen ‘nation’s sweetheart’ co-star. A fantasy drama heartthrob forced to work with his ex’s current boyfriend. A ‘devoted husband’ actor teamed with the woman every wife in Hollywood hates. And a rising star stuck with her ex-boyfriend’s mother."

Evelyn shot upright, eyes gleaming. "Sign me up."

If she missed this trainwreck, she’d regret it forever.
###Chapter 59

Marcus moved with lightning speed. After coordinating with the production team of My Acting Skill, he made two major announcements back-to-back using Julian Blackwood’s agency’s official account.

The first announcement declared that Evelyn Sinclair had been signed as the agency’s second artist.

The second dropped the bombshell—Julian himself would be partnering with Evelyn on the show.

Within minutes, both the agency’s official page and Julian’s personal Twitter exploded. Since Evelyn had been tagged in the posts, her own account saw a sudden surge of traffic.

Who is this nobody? Why does Julian have to team up with her?

Wasn’t Julian just spotted with Isabelle Laurent, the rising star? Rumor has it he’s been mentoring her as a favor to a family friend.

Wake up, people! Isabelle withdrew from the show ages ago!

I heard whispers weeks ago about an unknown artist visiting Julian’s agency frequently.

The real question is—why would Julian’s agency sign a second artist at all? Who is she? What’s her deal? Someone dig up her entire life story in the next ten minutes!

Just as Marcus had anticipated, the sudden appearance of a breathtaking beauty—one of only two artists under Julian’s prestigious agency—ignited public curiosity. The focus swiftly shifted from Isabelle to the mysterious connection between Julian and Evelyn.

Ten minutes passed, yet no one could uncover a complete profile on Evelyn. Her Wikipedia page was sparse, listing only a handful of magazine shoots and minor ad campaigns. A few blurry paparazzi shots surfaced, but nothing substantial.

Marcus had no intention of revealing Evelyn’s background. Speculation bred intrigue, and intrigue meant attention. Of course, he’d assigned Lillian to monitor the situation closely. If any damaging rumors took shape, they’d be swiftly crushed.

In truth, Evelyn had handed full control of her main Twitter account to Marcus. She only browsed casually from a private alt account.

After a long silence, Evelyn finally logged into her official profile. She wiped all personal posts, leaving only professional work-related content, then uploaded a fresh batch—compilations of her recent acting classes and striking new photos.

Unsurprisingly, she gained a small following of admirers drawn to her looks. But, as expected, the haters came out in full force—bored, bitter, and eager to tear her down.

Yet, the drama quickly faded as other show participants began making their own announcements.

The official announcements had barely gone live when the production team launched their first major promotional campaign. Overnight, the show's popularity exploded beyond expectations.

Just as Marcus Donovan had predicted, each celebrity pairing came with its own shocking backstory. Evelyn Sinclair found herself utterly engrossed in the Twitter storm, scrolling through endless juicy gossip. While the veracity of these stories remained questionable, they provided endless entertainment. The first featured couple consisted of an A-list actor known for his icy demeanor and his former on-screen love interest - both from the same entertainment company, playing mentor and protégé. At the height of their on-screen chemistry, the company had sent the younger actress abroad to pursue international opportunities.

After several lackluster years overseas, this marked her grand return to domestic entertainment. Cleverly leveraging their past popularity, she'd secured a spot on the hottest reality show alongside her former co-star.

Paired with this megawatt superstar who promised guidance and protection throughout filming, they naturally became the most anticipated couple among the five participating pairs.

When the "Young Again" logo appeared, it reignited the dormant passion of their shippers, who immediately comprised half the show's viewership.

Paparazzi had already flooded social media with recent photos of the duo spotted together at various locations. One particularly viral shot showed the towering actor shielding his petite co-star from cameras, his arm wrapped protectively around her shoulders. Another captured them sharing a private joke, their faces inches apart. Though grainy, the images radiated undeniable intimacy - like long-lost lovers reunited against all odds.

The internet collectively lost its mind over the possibility of a real-life second-chance romance.

Evelyn couldn't contain her laughter as she scrolled through the scandalous photos. "This is insane! If people knew this supposedly devoted family man was getting cozy with another woman, he'd be crucified online!"

Though Julian Blackwood and Lillian Graves were preoccupied with their own tasks, and even Nathan had left for an important meeting, the moment they caught wind of this gossip, everyone dropped what they were doing to join the conversation.

Marcus adjusted his glasses with a knowing smirk. "The fact that they kept his marriage under wraps for years proves they're masters at this game. They wouldn't take this risk unless they'd calculated every outcome. This kind of publicity benefits both careers immensely."

"So... were they actually involved?" Lillian asked skeptically. After all, the entertainment industry specialized in manufacturing convincing illusions.

"I honestly don't see what's so remarkable about that actress to make a famous actor behave like this. There must be more to this story," Marcus replied with a careless shrug.

"Women in showbiz must have nerves of steel to tolerate their husbands getting cozy with other women!" Evelyn muttered, shaking her head in disbelief.

"Rumor has it his wife holds shares in the company too. You know how it works in Hollywood—everyone turns a blind eye. No need for messy divorces," Marcus added.

Evelyn couldn't help feeling disappointed. The actor was undeniably handsome, and she'd briefly considered becoming his fan. But after witnessing this scandal unfold, she quickly changed her mind. The next hot topic was the unexpected pairing of two male idols.

Both were legends in their respective genres—one dominated medieval fantasy epics while the other ruled teen campus romances. They worked for the same production company now.

Nearing their thirties, both wanted to reinvent their images, which was why they'd joined this variety show. Teaming up was a strategic move to boost their popularity. But insiders knew the juicy backstory: the teen idol's current girlfriend had secretly dated the fantasy star back when he was still a nobody.

Even after all these years, working alongside your girlfriend's ex had to be awkward as hell.

"I can't wait to see their fake smiles in public versus their real tension behind the scenes! This is going to be delicious!" Evelyn squealed with anticipation.

The third couple's buzz revolved around their new movie's promotional tour—a lavish retelling of Cleopatra's story.

The veteran actor played Julius Caesar. Throughout filming, fans worried his electrifying chemistry with the actress playing Cleopatra might spark real feelings—especially since this actress had earned quite the reputation. Every film she starred in came with scandal—whether with her leading man or the director. Wives in Hollywood had even blacklisted her at one point. Yet when publicly called a "homewrecker" by a scorned wife, she'd simply smiled and thanked her for the "compliment."
She reveled in the power she held over men's hearts.

Done.

This time, her target was a legendary actor, famous for his devoted husband persona. The revelation sent shockwaves through the entertainment world. It became the ultimate showdown—who would outmaneuver whom? When Evelyn saw the actress's photo, she was instantly intrigued.

Marcus had mentioned the actor's wife would be on set, keeping a watchful eye. Evelyn shuddered at the thought of the impending drama.

The final pairing, though initially the least anticipated, quickly became everyone's favorite spectacle. People couldn't resist a juicy scandal.

A veteran TV actress from the golden era and a rising star of the new generation should have shared a harmonious mentor-protégé bond. But with a man caught between them, their relationship teetered dangerously close to a toxic mother-in-law and daughter-in-law dynamic.

Originally, the older actress had joined the show to scrutinize her son's girlfriend. She'd personally requested the younger woman's participation.

Yet before filming even began, the couple had already split.

The internet cringed in secondhand embarrassment for them. Surprisingly, neither backed out after the official announcement.

This only fueled the audience's anticipation for their on-screen interactions.

Public opinion, however, overwhelmingly favored the rising star. Her ex-boyfriend was infamous for being a mama's boy, and his mother had earned a reputation as the villainous mother-in-law, having driven away countless potential daughters-in-law. This time, it was the actress who had ended things. Many speculated the mother's insistence on staying was purely for revenge—in her eyes, her son could never be at fault. How could a nobody actress ever be worthy of him?

Evelyn had followed the rising star's career and admired her work ethic. The actress was prolific, churning out project after project.

When Evelyn voiced her admiration, Marcus scoffed. "Not everyone slacks off after breaking into the industry like you do. She's hustling to make a living. Though, I’ll admit, she might be overdoing it a bit."

The tension was palpable. The stage was set. And Evelyn couldn't wait to see how this explosive dynamic would unfold.

###Chapter 60

After an afternoon filled with juicy gossip, Evelyn Sinclair found herself with nothing new to uncover. She could only wait with bated breath for the drama to unfold.

When she returned to the Blackwood manor that evening, the entire family was already buzzing about their upcoming appearance on a live variety show together.

"This will be Evelyn's first time on a live show! I'm definitely watching from start to finish," Margaret exclaimed excitedly.

Sophia Blackwood, holding little Theodore's hand, chimed in, "We'll be cheering for you too!"

Julian Blackwood crossed his arms, feigning offense. "I don’t remember getting this much enthusiasm when I was on a show."

Margaret rolled her eyes. "That’s because you’re not as charming as Evelyn."

"Don’t worry about a thing, darling," Richard reassured Evelyn. "If things get uncomfortable, just walk out. Julian can handle the fallout."

Julian opened his mouth to protest, but Richard added, "And yes, the penalty fee comes out of your paycheck."

Am I adopted? Julian thought bitterly.

Evelyn smiled sweetly at each of them, but her inner monologue betrayed her excitement. No way I’m backing out! This is going to be legendary drama! Two male idols feuding? A secret wife versus the mistress? A scandalous affair? I’ll be front-row for all of it!

The Blackwoods froze.

Did… did Evelyn just—?

Margaret’s eyes sparkled. That sounds delicious. Why can’t we hear her thoughts on live TV?

Suddenly, everyone turned to Julian with expectant stares.

"Julian!" Genevieve piped up. "I’ve nearly  my latest painting. I could come help on set!"

Julian’s eye twitched. "…Sure. Whenever you’re free."

"Perfect!" Genevieve grinned, victorious.

"Can we visit the set?" Margaret and Richard asked in unison.

Julian narrowed his eyes. His parents had never visited him on set before. "Fine. But not every day."

Margaret and Richard high-fived.

Sophia, still holding Theodore, pouted. "I wish I could go too…"

Margaret and Genevieve exchanged a knowing glance. Don’t worry. We’ll report back.

Nathan Blackwood, silently sipping his coffee, was once again relegated to the role of the family’s overlooked moneymaker. He sighed. Why do I feel like an outsider in my own home?

Shopping for Drama

"By the way," Julian said, "Marcus mentioned no brands have offered you outfits yet, so you’ll need to bring your own."

Evelyn shrugged. "I have plenty in my closet. The stylist can just pick from those."

Margaret gasped. "Absolutely not! For an event like this, you must wear the latest designs. I’ll have all of Blackwood Group’s partners send over their best pieces."

Sophia perked up. "I’m taking Theo shopping tomorrow. Want to join us?"

Evelyn’s eyes lit up as she turned to Julian. "Guess I’m skipping class tomorrow!"

Her thoughts echoed through the room. YES! A free pass to ditch school!

Julian sighed but relented. After all, she had been working hard lately.

Genevieve pouted. "I wish I could go, but I have to finish my painting."

Margaret patted her hand. "Next time." Then, she turned to Nathan. "Nathan, dear, why don’t you join us tomorrow?"

Nathan nearly choked on his coffee.

Evelyn’s inner voice grumbled. Why bring a man to a girls’ shopping trip?

Nathan’s lips twitched. An irrefutable argument.

A Shocking Encounter

The next day, Margaret and Sophia headed to the children’s section with Theodore, leaving Nathan to accompany Evelyn through the women’s boutiques.

Evelyn wasn’t complaining—having a handsome, wealthy man footing the bill was never a bad thing.

But the moment they stepped into the first VIP lounge, they froze.

There, in the middle of a heated argument, stood Natalie Whitaker—Harrison Montgomery’s secret wife—facing off against Vanessa Sterling, his very public mistress.

"Vanessa, I need that dress for the show!" Natalie hissed.

"It’s mine," Vanessa snapped. "I reserved it first."

Evelyn’s jaw dropped. No. Freaking. Way.

Nathan leaned down, his voice low. "That’s Natalie Whitaker—Harrison Montgomery’s wife—and Vanessa Sterling, his mistress."

Evelyn whipped her head toward him. "How do you know that?"

Nathan’s expression remained unreadable. "I make it my business to know who you’re working with."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. Even Marcus might not know about Natalie. What aren’t you telling me, Nathan?

Before she could press further, the argument escalated.

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed. This is it. The drama I’ve been waiting for.

She grabbed Nathan’s arm and pulled him closer.

Time to get front-row seats to the scandal of the year.
###Chapter 61

The boutique’s air was thick with tension as Natalie Whitaker and Vanessa Sterling stood facing each other, the coveted fishtail gown hanging between them like a prize neither was willing to surrender.

“I don’t recall you reserving this, Natalie. You probably just got here first, and frankly, it might not even suit you,” Vanessa said smoothly, her lips curving into a smirk. Her fingers traced the delicate fabric, her gaze dripping with condescension.

Natalie’s jaw tightened. “This isn’t a coincidence, is it? You came here deliberately to take this from me.” Her voice was low, simmering with barely restrained anger. “You’re utterly shameless.”

Behind her oversized sunglasses, Vanessa’s eyes flashed with irritation. “I’m not taking anything. Some things are simply meant for certain people. Even if you force your way into claiming them, they’ll never truly be yours.” Her tone was saccharine, laced with venom.

The sales associate clutching the dress looked like she wanted to vanish. The unspoken subtext was painfully clear—this wasn’t just about a dress. It was about a man.

Oh, this poor woman must be screaming internally for someone to rescue her, Evelyn Sinclair mused, crouched behind a display counter like a spy in her own drama.

Nathan Blackwood, standing nearby, caught her thoughts and sighed. He watched as Evelyn, practically vibrating with excitement, peeked around the corner, her eyes gleaming with the thrill of unfolding gossip. Nearby, the sales associate hesitated, unsure whether to intervene or flee.

Nathan discreetly waved her off, signaling her to wait. Let Evelyn have her fun first.

The sales associate exhaled in relief and subtly stepped aside—only to nearly jump out of her skin when she spotted two women and a child hiding behind another counter, shamelessly eavesdropping. Sophia Blackwood and Margaret Blackwood—Nathan’s sister and mother—were fully invested, gesturing for her to move so they could see better.

Nathan turned, spotted them, and pinched the bridge of his nose. Unbelievable.

Originally, Sophia and Margaret had intended to observe Nathan and Evelyn’s interactions, but the moment they overheard the brewing catfight, all bets were off. Especially since Vanessa Sterling was someone Sophia recognized.

The argument raged on.

Evelyn’s thoughts spilled into the Blackwood family’s minds like a scandalous exposé. *Ah, so this is the classic tale of the childhood sweetheart versus the seductive newcomer. Harrison Montgomery and Natalie were married for years, but then Vanessa waltzed in as the fresh-faced junior at his company. What started as a professional partnership turned into something far messier. The families noticed, panicked, and shipped Vanessa off abroad to “cultivate her talents.” But her career flopped, her marriage to some sleazy director ended in disaster, and now she’s back—convinced Natalie ruined her life. And of course, she wants revenge. How predictable.

Sophia’s expression darkened. She knew Natalie personally and felt a surge of protectiveness.

Evelyn, meanwhile, had just mentally accessed Natalie’s information. Her eyes widened. Oh. Oh no. Her inner monologue stuttered to a halt. How could Harrison do this to her? After all these years?

A bitter thought crossed her mind. Men. As reliable as a pig climbing a tree. She side-eyed Nathan.

Nathan frowned. Please don’t lump all of us together.

Back at the counter, Natalie lifted her chin, her pride unbroken despite the humiliation. She handed the sales associate a black card. “Ring it up.”

The associate swiped it—once, twice. Her smile faltered. “Ma’am… your card has been declined. It appears to be canceled.”

Natalie’s face drained of color.

Vanessa’s lips curled in triumph. “Out of money, Natalie? Some things just aren’t meant to be yours.”

Natalie’s hands trembled as she pulled out every card and bill she had, but it wasn’t enough. The dress’s price tag was exorbitant.

The onlookers—Sophia, Margaret, Evelyn, even the sales staff—were stunned.

Oh, this is vile, Evelyn seethed internally. Vanessa knew. She knew Harrison canceled Natalie’s card right in front of her. This was a setup.

The Blackwoods exchanged horrified glances.

I need to find out why Harrison—Mr. High-and-Mighty—would do something this cruel, Evelyn vowed.

And just like that, the boutique had become the stage for a scandal far juicier than anyone had anticipated.
###Chapter 62

The tension in the boutique was palpable. Before Evelyn could dig deeper into the situation, Vanessa had already spun her web of lies.

After savoring Natalie’s humiliation, Vanessa smirked. "It's all because you set me up at that party, letting those men force drinks on me. I nearly got into serious trouble because of you. Harrison said since you have the money to orchestrate such a scheme, he might as well cancel your card so you can’t hurt anyone again."

Natalie’s face paled. "I didn’t do it! That’s not true!"

Vanessa scoffed. "Who else would want to ruin me? You’re the only one here who hates me enough to try."

You did this yourself, Vanessa! Evelyn screamed internally. You pretended to accept Natalie’s invitation in front of Harrison, then texted him halfway through, claiming something felt off. You staged the whole thing!

The Blackwood family, privy to Evelyn’s thoughts, exchanged glances. She’s not just a mistress—she’s a master manipulator. Vanessa had framed herself as the victim, earning Harrison’s sympathy and trust. And Harrison, blinded by bias, refused to hear Natalie’s side. Once a man’s judgment is clouded, his intelligence plummets.

The Blackwoods seethed silently. This wasn’t their drama, but the injustice was infuriating.

Evelyn’s thoughts continued. After this scandal, everyone in the industry knows Vanessa is Harrison’s woman. No one dares mess with her now. And Harrison, feeling guilty, is backing her comeback with full force. Pathetic.

Margaret and Sophia Blackwood couldn’t help but scoff.

Natalie, desperate, tried calling Harrison. No answer. She dialed his assistant instead, but whatever he said left her utterly defeated.

Evelyn clenched her fists. Relying on a man’s credit card is a fool’s game. Look at this so-called husband—revoking his wife’s card for his mistress. Disgusting.

Sophia and Margaret nodded in agreement. CEO husbands loved flexing their power over their wives.

Nathan Blackwood felt a chill. The reputation of husbands everywhere is under attack!

"Since you can’t afford it, I’ll take it," Vanessa taunted.

Natalie glared. "You left your marriage with nothing. You don’t even have a job. How can you afford this dress? You just want to take it from me!"

With a smirk, Vanessa handed the sales associate a membership card.

The associate recognized it immediately—a supplementary card linked to the store’s VIP account.

Natalie’s breath hitched. Harrison had this store’s VIP membership, but she’d never needed a supplementary card. She always used the black card directly.

The associate confirmed, "This is Mr. Montgomery’s supplementary card. You may sign for the purchase."

The onlookers gasped. Evelyn’s thoughts spilled into their minds. Harrison gave his mistress a supplementary card but not his wife? The audacity!

Evelyn was livid. This is beyond low.

Vanessa held the dress against herself, snapping a mirror selfie. She sent it to Harrison with a voice note. "Harrison, what do you think?"

Scumbag! Evelyn thought.

Vanessa smirked. "Oh, Harrison thinks it suits me better. Pity—I was going to gift it to you to make up for recent… misunderstandings."

Disgusting! Evelyn fumed.

Before Vanessa could gloat further, Natalie’s hand flew out—SLAP!

The impact sent Vanessa’s sunglasses and phone clattering to the floor.

The crowd froze, then collectively exhaled in satisfaction.

Vanessa shrieked. "How dare you hit me!"

She lunged, but Evelyn shouted, "Hey! You’re disrupting business!"

The interruption gave the staff time to intervene.

Vanessa, clutching her reddened cheek, sneered. "Since Harrison prefers me in this dress, I’ll take it."

She knew exactly how to twist the knife. She’d wear this dress every time she saw Natalie, rubbing salt in the wound.

But then—

"That dress? I want it." Evelyn declared. Rumor has it my husband owns this mall. How delightful.

###Chapter 63

Evelyn Sinclair wasn’t the type to recklessly jump into situations where she might end up playing the hero—especially if it risked her own humiliation. What kind of twisted irony would that be?

Before making her move, Evelyn turned to Nathan Blackwood and lowered her voice. "You own this entire mall, don’t you?"

Nathan, caught off guard, hesitated before answering, "Yes."

Evelyn pressed further. "So that means I can do whatever I want here?"

Nathan gave a vague nod. "Within reason."

Her next question was bold. "Then I can take that dress?"

Nathan already had an inkling of what Evelyn was plotting. Without hesitation, he pulled out his phone and swiftly messaged his assistant.

Truthfully, Nathan suspected that if Evelyn didn’t act fast, the couple lingering behind them might lose their patience. Not that he blamed them—his family was notorious for their warm hearts, but even they had limits.

When Evelyn suddenly raised her voice, Nathan could practically feel the collective sigh of resignation from the people behind them. The onlookers ahead spun around, their expressions a mix of shock and disbelief, as if they hadn’t expected anyone to disrupt the scene.

Vanessa Sterling, observing Evelyn’s confident demeanor, couldn’t immediately place her. It wasn’t until she spotted Sophia Blackwood—the kind-hearted hospital director who had comforted her during her lonely hospital stays—smiling and waving from a distance that realization struck. They had crossed paths earlier at a restaurant.

Though embarrassed to be seen in such a disheveled state by people she knew, Natalie Whitaker understood they were there to support her.

Vanessa, however, was baffled. Does she know Natalie? Is she here to help her?

"Are these your friends, Natalie?" Vanessa asked cautiously.

Natalie replied bluntly, "I don’t know them."

Vanessa turned back to Evelyn, scrutinizing her. Up close, recognition flickered—though all the online photos of Evelyn were heavily edited, glamorous model shots. In person, she looked strikingly different—fresh-faced, vibrant, more like a dazzling university belle than a polished celebrity.

Vanessa’s gaze then shifted to the man beside Evelyn. His striking features and composed demeanor, his dark eyes gleaming like polished black opals, radiated an air of effortless superiority. It was rare for Vanessa to encounter someone who exuded both charisma and breathtaking beauty.

Even Harrison Montgomery, the famous actor, would pale in comparison.

Noticing their high-end attire, Vanessa deduced their wealth and status. But that didn’t excuse Evelyn’s audacity to claim the dress she had reserved.

"Miss, I’ve already reserved this dress," Vanessa declared.

Evelyn merely smiled. "No payment’s been made. That means it’s still up for grabs. And frankly, I think it suits me better."

Vanessa stiffened. The words felt eerily familiar—too similar to a conversation she’d once had with Natalie.

"I’ve made my decision, and I can afford it. You’re too late," Vanessa snapped, turning to the saleswoman. "I’ll sign the bill. Wrap it up—"

Before the saleswoman could comply, a directive crackled through the earpieces of every staff member present. The saleswoman’s expression shifted, and she handed Vanessa’s supplementary card back.

Vanessa’s face darkened. "What is this?"

The saleswoman maintained a professional tone. "I’m sorry, but this dress is no longer available for sale, per the store manager’s orders. As an apology, we can offer you a ten percent discount on any other item."

"You’re refusing to sell it to me? You’d rather sell it to her?" Vanessa pointed at Evelyn in disbelief.

At that moment, Evelyn stepped forward, flashing the exclusive membership card Nathan had given her.

The saleswoman’s eyes widened. It was a rare, top-tier VVIP card—one that granted access to items not publicly available.

"Would you like this dress, Miss?" the saleswoman asked Evelyn eagerly.

Evelyn nodded.

"Absolutely. Would you like to try it on?"

Vanessa gaped. "What the hell—?"

The saleswoman clarified, "This is our store’s VVIP membership card. Even Mr. Montgomery’s main card wouldn’t suffice, let alone a supplementary one."

Evelyn smirked. "I do like it."

Nathan raised a brow, amused. So this was her idea of affection.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the mall...

"Natalie, you’ve changed so much I barely recognize you anymore," Harrison’s voice crackled through the phone, laced with frustration. "Don’t you trust me at all? There’s nothing inappropriate between Vanessa and me. We’ve already wronged her enough—I’m just trying to make things right on your behalf. Could you please stop attacking her? If this continues, we really should discuss divorce."

"Now, go apologize to Vanessa!" he demanded.

Natalie’s voice was quiet, heavy with exhaustion. "I don’t even recognize you anymore, Harrison. Fine. Let’s get a divorce."

A pause. Then Harrison’s tone turned icy. "I’m serious, Natalie. I’m not joking."

"Neither am I," she replied firmly.

Harrison exhaled sharply. "How long are you going to keep this up? You’re draining every ounce of love I have left. Fine. I’ll clean up your messes. Take some time to cool off. Once I’ve sorted things with Vanessa, we’ll talk."

Before Natalie could respond, the line went dead.

A suffocating tightness seized her chest. Her vision blurred, her legs buckling—

Two sets of arms caught her before she could collapse.

Turning her head weakly, she saw Sophia Blackwood offering a strained smile.

Sophia and Margaret had been lingering nearby, debating whether to intervene. They’d overheard the entire conversation—and it had ignited a quiet fury in both of them.

"Come on," Sophia said gently. "I’ll take you to the hospital."

Later that evening...

As Evelyn and Nathan prepared to leave, they found only Margaret and Theodore waiting. Sophia, they learned, had taken Natalie to the hospital.

Margaret, bursting with indignation, relayed everything they’d overheard.

Evelyn’s eyes widened in disbelief.

How could he so blatantly ignore his wife’s pain and defend his mistress? And then have the audacity to claim he still loves her?

Men like him deserved to be buried.

###Chapter 64

Nathan Blackwood’s expression was one of utter disbelief. What had started as a simple walk had somehow eclipsed the arrival of the first group of guests entirely.

When Sophia Blackwood returned, curiosity buzzed through the room like static electricity. Though professionalism kept the questions at bay, the unspoken intrigue was palpable.

Sophia, bound by confidentiality, could only offer fragments. "She’s a tragic case. Since her admission, she’s been completely alone. Rumor has it her parents are gone, and her husband… well…"

Margaret, ever the concerned matriarch, frowned. "Didn’t she discuss her condition with him?"

Sophia shook her head. "She tried once. He accused her of lying—said she was inventing illness out of jealousy, cursed her for speaking it into existence. After that, she decided a man who doubted her didn’t deserve her truth."

Terminal. Days numbered. Why gamble on his regret when the clock was ticking? Wasn’t that just self-destruction in slow motion?

Though Sophia stayed guarded, Evelyn Sinclair’s careless murmurs sent fresh ripples of unease through the Blackwoods.

"She refuses treatment," Sophia finally admitted, frustration seeping into her voice. "There’s a chance her condition could be managed, but she’s given up."

"Nothing is more tragic than surrender," Margaret murmured, shaking her head.

A chorus of disapproval rose from the family.

Days later, the crew prepped to film My Acting Skill’s promotional video ahead of schedule. Whispers painted this as a grand affair—formal introductions, a dinner, possibly even fireworks. Evelyn, vibrating with excitement, chose her most dazzling mermaid-tail gown.

When Marcus Donovan arrived with the van, he couldn’t help but stare. "You’ll outshine everyone," he said.

Evelyn beamed. "I know, right?"

Julian, already inside, shot Marcus a warning look. "Stay sharp tonight."

Marcus blinked. "Why?"

Julian patted his shoulder. He and Evelyn didn’t care about burning bridges—unfortunately, Marcus would be the one left holding the ashes.

Marcus chuckled. "Worried Evelyn’s bluntness will offend someone? Don’t be. She’s raw, but her charm and looks will win people over. As a newcomer with no feuds, she’ll be fine."

Julian’s dry laugh said otherwise.

Marcus glanced at Evelyn, who was already deep in gossip-sharing mode with Lillian Graves.

Well… aside from the occasional verbal grenade, what’s the worst that could happen?

At the film studio, director Preston Whitmore and producer Donovan Sharpe greeted them personally—no surprise, given Nathan had already revealed his identity. Evelyn played the humble newcomer flawlessly.

The two men exhaled. Their biggest fear had been an entitled star making production hell.

"Today’s agenda: photos, then individual and group interviews," Donovan explained before ushering them to makeup.

The shared makeup space was a strategic choice—no favoritism, just efficiency. Partitions offered privacy while allowing multiple artists to work at once. Preston hoped the setup would ease the cast into camaraderie before live broadcasts.

Three groups had already arrived when Evelyn and Julian entered.

Marcus dove into the crowd, effortlessly working the room. Evelyn, dragged along, greeted everyone with bright-eyed enthusiasm. The whirlwind of introductions left Marcus scrambling to match faces to gossip, while Evelyn—still an unknown—was mostly ignored.

Her eyes gleamed. So many secrets waiting to be uncovered.

Before she could pounce, a snippet of conversation caught her ear:

"Only Harrison Montgomery and Vanessa Sterling’s team is missing."

"Did you see the marketing blast earlier?"

A knowing laugh. "Bet they’ll be late."

Another voice, dripping with amusement. "Who knows? This show might just make their affair official."

Rumors of Harrison’s secret marriage had swirled, but with the scandal growing, doubt festered. Where was his so-called wife? Why wasn’t she defending him?

He rushed to Vanessa’s penthouse in the middle of the night and never left. Subtle.

A storm had knocked out power in Vanessa’s upscale neighborhood. Terrified of the dark, she’d called Harrison. Is he a human nightlight? Meanwhile, his actual wife was enduring treatment alone.

Shockingly, Maxwell Thornton—Harrison’s manager—seemed oblivious to the optics. This wasn’t just Harrison’s recklessness; Maxwell lacked vision.

Days later, and she’s still swollen? Even a brick would’ve healed by now. Unless…

Oh.

She’s faking it to keep him close.

Evelyn leaned toward Lillian. "Play along later."

Lillian’s confusion melted into a sly grin.

Julian’s unease spiked. Why do I feel disaster looming?

As chatter and styling continued, a sudden hush fell. All eyes turned to Evelyn.

"I stole that dress on purpose," she announced.

Lillian played along. "Why?"

"Because the two women fighting over it? Mistress and wife."

Gasps.

"Seriously?"

"Here’s what really happened…"

By the time Evelyn , the room was electrified. The tale—clearly real—wasn’t a jab at anyone present, but a scandalous actress known for mistress roles still shot her a glare.

The wife of a veteran actor rolled her eyes, unbothered.

The crowd hung on every word. If only the man had half a brain, he’d see through her schemes.

When Evelyn , the room buzzed anew, treating it as juicy gossip. Even Marcus didn’t press for details.

Then—commotion at the door. Harrison and Vanessa had arrived.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn and Lillian slipped away to change. Their costumes waited, prepped and ready.

As Harrison and Vanessa entered, Julian’s dread solidified.

I don’t even want to imagine the chaos when Evelyn reappears.

###Chapter 65

Nathan Blackwood and Vanessa Sterling arrived last, greeted warmly by the crew as they entered the bustling set. After brief exchanges and polite nods, everyone returned to their stations, resuming the flurry of styling preparations.

The director, Preston Whitmore, and producer, Donovan Sharpe, pulled Nathan and Vanessa aside for a quick discussion.

Meanwhile, hushed whispers spread among the crew about the undeniable chemistry between the two stars. Observant onlookers caught them exchanging knowing glances and soft smiles, fueling speculation that something deeper was brewing between them.

A few nostalgic staff members, reminiscent of their days shipping celebrity couples, couldn’t help but grin at the sight of Nathan and Vanessa standing so close.

The atmosphere shifted abruptly when the door to the nearby dressing room swung open. Julian Blackwood’s group had been notably absent during the earlier greetings—specifically, Evelyn Sinclair had yet to make her appearance.

Now, it was clear who was about to step out.

Evelyn emerged in a breathtaking sapphire mermaid gown that instantly commanded the room’s attention. Though her makeup was still un, her statuesque figure—pale skin, sharp shoulders, and a slender waist—enhanced by the dress’s silhouette, made her presence utterly mesmerizing.

She was a natural scene-stealer, prompting silent admiration from the crew. Even without refined acting skills, her sheer magnetism was undeniable.

But not everyone was impressed.

Julian looked uneasy, Nathan’s brow furrowed, and Vanessa stiffened in surprise.

Before Vanessa could gather her thoughts, Nathan, standing nearby, arched a skeptical brow and addressed Evelyn. “Wasn’t this gown prepared for Vanessa? Miss Sinclair, did you perhaps mistake someone else’s wardrobe for your own?” The implication hung heavily in the air.

All costumes had been meticulously sorted and delivered earlier. How could such a mix-up happen? Nathan recognized the dress—it was meant for Vanessa’s shoot. It couldn’t have ended up on Evelyn unless it was intentional.

His expression darkened. He firmly believed no one, regardless of connections, had the right to undermine others—especially not someone he felt compelled to protect. Vanessa’s past struggles, often confided to him, had left him hyper-aware of any perceived slights against her.

As Nathan’s accusation rippled through the room, confusion spread among the staff. Even his manager, Maxwell Thornton, looked baffled.

This unexpected clash between the seasoned actor and the rising star was something no one had anticipated. Isn’t that dress Evelyn’s own? many wondered, recalling her earlier excitement about it.

Marcus Donovan quickly stepped in, chuckling nervously. “Ah, Mr. Blackwood, perhaps there’s been a misunderstanding? This gown was purchased by our artist herself. Did it happen to match one of Ms. Sterling’s? What an odd coincidence!”

The words snapped Vanessa out of her daze. Her shock deepened as she realized the newcomer was none other than Evelyn—the woman from that day. A storm of emotions flickered across her face: confusion, embarrassment, and a flicker of resentment.

Then, Evelyn—equally stunned—pointed at Vanessa and blurted, “It’s you! You’re Vanessa!”

The tension in the room thickened, every eye darting between the two women, sensing drama unfolding.

What’s going on? Do they have history? Did Nathan mention a dress earlier? Wait… something’s off.

Vanessa scrutinized Evelyn, noting her visible discomfort. She probably doesn’t even realize what she’s done. She thinks she’s accidentally crossed someone.

A smirk tugged at Vanessa’s lips. Fine. I’ll play along—for now.

Nathan’s gaze shifted to Evelyn, who seemed genuinely flustered. Is she really this socially unaware, or is she banking on Julian’s influence?

Despite the brewing storm, Vanessa remained the picture of grace. Outwardly composed, she masked the turmoil churning inside her—memories tied to that dress resurfacing painfully.

“It’s fine,” Vanessa said smoothly, her tone laced with quiet sarcasm. “She clearly admires the dress, and honestly, it suits her better. Let’s call it a misunderstanding.”

Her last remark, dripping with irony, was whispered just loud enough for Julian to catch. He stifled a laugh.

The crew exchanged awkward glances, torn between amusement and secondhand embarrassment.

“Actually, I should apologize,” Nathan conceded dryly, addressing Evelyn with a tight smile. “I assumed you’d taken Vanessa’s dress by mistake.”

Still missing the point, the crew collectively thought, struggling not to laugh.

Evelyn remained flustered, and Nathan couldn’t fathom her prolonged awkwardness. Does she not understand basic professionalism?

“Let’s… ensure clearer communication moving forward,” he added stiffly.

The sentiment hung awkwardly in the air as everyone processed the bizarre confrontation, unsure whether to intervene or simply watch the spectacle unfold.

###Chapter 66

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't help but admire Nathan Blackwood's ability to maintain his icy, untouchable superstar persona despite the tension simmering beneath the surface. He really is a master at this, she mused, watching him navigate the strained conversation with practiced ease. Let’s see how long he can keep up the act.

Suppressing a smirk, Evelyn quickly nodded and retreated to her corner, feigning relief as if she’d narrowly avoided a social disaster. Nearby, Marcus Donovan looked like he’d been struck by lightning, his mind racing. Did my artist just accidentally set off a bomb? This could ruin everything. His fingers twitched as he mentally scrambled for damage control.

Julian Blackwood, observing Marcus’ distress from the sidelines, barely concealed his amusement. Soon, he thought, everything’s about to explode.

Without a word, everyone in the room—even those from other groups—found themselves drawn to the mirrors, adjusting partitions for a better view of the unfolding drama. Some were already whispering behind their hands, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Meanwhile, Harrison Montgomery and Vanessa Sterling, slow to catch on to Evelyn’s earlier implications, tried to refocus on their discussion with director Preston Whitmore and producer Donovan Sharpe. But something was off. Both men were unusually stiff, avoiding eye contact, their knuckles white where they gripped their scripts.

Harrison and Vanessa exchanged confused glances.

Preston cleared his throat abruptly. "Uh… I just remembered there’s something I haven’t arranged yet."

Donovan echoed, panic creeping into his voice, "Same here—I still need to finalize the director."

The pair’s bizarre excuses left Harrison and Vanessa even more bewildered. Turning around, they realized their entire team—save for their manager, Maxwell Thornton—was suddenly engrossed in their phones or pretending not to hear.

Maxwell looked like a man standing on the edge of a cliff. His gaze darted between Vanessa and Harrison, his mouth opening and closing without sound.

This can’t be happening.

Despite his frequent clashes with Natalie Whitaker, Harrison’s wife, Maxwell had been adamant about pairing Harrison with Vanessa for their marketability. But now? That story Evelyn had spun—it was about them. The realization hit him like a freight train.

Everyone heard it. They practically confirmed it themselves earlier. Private affairs are one thing, but admitting it in front of the entire crew?

Maxwell was sweating bullets.

Vanessa, sensing the shift, frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Snapping out of his daze, Maxwell grabbed their arms. "Let’s discuss this outside—now."

The moment they stepped out, the makeup room erupted—first in stunned silence, then in hushed whispers. Until—

"WHAT?!"

A woman’s shriek pierced the air from outside, sharp with shock.

Inside, someone gasped, "Holy shit," while another burst into laughter.

The murmurs swelled into excited chatter, and soon, admiring glances were being thrown Evelyn’s way. Did she plan this? No one knew for sure, but the sheer audacity of the coincidence had everyone buzzing.

Veterans in the industry exchanged glances. Never seen a scandal unfold like this before. Phones were already out, fingers flying over screens as the news spread like wildfire.

Harrison’s PR team would scramble to contain it, but the damage was done. The story was out, and the backlash was already forming.

The only one not enjoying the spectacle was Marcus, who looked like he was about to faint. He pointed a trembling finger at Evelyn.

She blinked innocently. "I swear I didn’t mean for this to happen. Look into my eyes—don’t I seem genuine?"

If only Harrison hadn’t been so quick to defend Vanessa. If only Vanessa hadn’t tried to paint Evelyn as the villain right in front of him. They could’ve denied everything. But no—they’d dug their own graves.

Julian stepped in, shielding Evelyn. "You can’t blame her. How was she supposed to know they’d react like that? They brought this on themselves."

Vanessa’s voice trembled through tears. "It wasn’t like that! Evelyn lied!"

Harrison’s face went numb, the weight of public humiliation pressing down on him. This can’t be real.

Evelyn didn’t even know them. Why would she make up such a story? Even through his anger, Harrison couldn’t ignore the inconsistencies.

Vanessa sobbed harder. "Harrison, don’t you trust me? I was just upset that day—my ex-husband wouldn’t stop harassing me! I went out to clear my head and found a dress I thought you’d like!"

Harrison stiffened. "Your ex contacted you again? Why didn’t you tell me?" Memories of Vanessa’s troubled past resurfaced, stirring his protective instincts.

Guilt twisted in his chest as he looked at her tear-streaked face.

"I didn’t want to burden you more," she whispered. "I’ve already caused so much trouble between you and Natalie. What if we’re seen together again? What will your wife do?" Her voice cracked. "Why would Evelyn target me? Does Natalie know her?"

His phone rang endlessly before Natalie finally answered, the sound of retching in the background.

Irritated, Harrison snapped, "Why did it take you so long to pick up?"

A pause. Then Natalie’s hoarse voice: "What? Calling to reassure me your night was innocent?"

Harrison froze. "Enough! I don’t have time for this. Do you know Evelyn Sinclair?"

Natalie hesitated. "After Sophia brought me back to the hospital that day, I asked about her. Sophia said she’s her sister-in-law—also on the show."

Harrison’s blood ran cold. "So you do know her!"

Natalie scoffed. "So what?"

Vanessa’s eyes widened. She set me up.

Harrison’s temper exploded. "Natalie, did you ignore my last warning? You—you—"

"The dress," he seethed.

Natalie went silent. Then, softly: "Oh. You knew? And you still…"

His voice turned to ice. "If this happens again, we’re done. I can’t take this anymore."

He hung up, leaving Natalie staring at her phone, nausea rising in her throat.

The room outside was still buzzing.

And Evelyn? She merely smiled.
###Chapter 67

The call ended abruptly, leaving Harrison Montgomery's face etched with bitter disappointment. He hadn't anticipated Natalie Whitaker's sharp rebuke. Turning to Vanessa Sterling, he exhaled heavily before murmuring, "I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. Natalie... She's not herself right now. I'll speak to her later."

Vanessa offered a delicate smile, though triumph flickered in her eyes. "It's alright. Love makes people do irrational things. I... understand." Her voice was soft, but inside, her pulse raced. Harrison mentioning divorce? This was better than she'd dared hope.

Her gaze lingered on him, but when he caught her staring, he averted his eyes, discomfort tightening his jaw.

Vanessa maintained her fragile facade—the picture of wounded innocence. Harrison's resolve wavered, and in a reckless moment, he seized her wrist.

She barely had time to feign surprise before he declared, "We're settling this now!" and dragged her forward.

Panic clawed at her throat. How can I face them? But it was too late to protest.

Harrison's expression hardened with misplaced determination. He wouldn't let Vanessa suffer alone—not when he could "defend" her honor.

Their managers, distracted by damage control, failed to intercept Harrison's impulsive charge.

The makeup room doors burst open, silencing the chatter inside. Everyone froze.

No one had expected Harrison and Vanessa to return—not after the scandal had exploded online.

This is beyond awkward...

Why isn’t he hiding in shame?

Evelyn Sinclair, Julian Blackwood, and Marcus Donovan exchanged stunned glances.

Are they seriously using the 'if we act unbothered, everyone else will squirm' tactic?

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye-roll when Harrison stormed toward her, Vanessa in tow. His face was pale, his posture rigid—but instead of retreating, he redirected his humiliation into anger.

"Ms. Sinclair," he bit out, "stealing Vanessa’s dress was one thing, but fabricating lies about my relationship with her? That’s crossing a line." His glare swept over Julian and Marcus, a silent warning in his eyes.

Vanessa’s stomach twisted. Then, realization struck—the boutique would never release surveillance footage. Without proof, it’s my word against hers.

She steeled herself, doubling down on her act, her face the perfect mask of wounded dignity.

The room held its breath. Is there more to this story?

Evelyn blinked. She’d set a trap, yes—but spreading rumors?

Since when did I do that?

Ah. Of course. To men like him, the mistress is always truthful, and the wife is always lying.

Julian tensed, ready to intervene, but Marcus subtly held him back. "Mr. Montgomery, this is a misunderstanding. Evelyn wasn’t referring to you two."

Harrison’s manager, Maxwell Thornton, jumped in—though damage control would’ve been wiser. "Everyone knows who Ms. Sinclair meant. We won’t tolerate slander. An apology would resolve this."

Evelyn nearly laughed. They actually believe Vanessa’s act?

The tension thickened as the managers squared off. Staff scrambled to find the director.

Then Evelyn struck.

"Tell me, was it an accident that you ignored your wife’s calls? You couldn’t even spare a moment for her, yet you replied to Vanessa instantly?"

Harrison’s face flushed crimson.

Evelyn pressed on, "Or is it because your wife and Vanessa never actually met that day?"

The memory of Natalie’s slap and accusations hit Harrison like a physical blow.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Mr. Montgomery, where, exactly, did I spread false rumors?"

The room waited.

Harrison had no answer.

Even Maxwell looked stunned.

No twist? No grand defense?

He came back just to humiliate himself further.

Silence stretched.

Then came the whispers:

How could he be this delusional?

What a fool.


###Chapter 68

Harrison Montgomery, who prided himself on being a man of principle, rarely felt the need to lie. But under the weight of Evelyn Sinclair’s piercing gaze, even the innocent might falter, their cheeks flushing with unwarranted guilt.

"What I’m trying to say isn’t—it’s just—" Harrison stumbled, his usual confidence crumbling unexpectedly.

Evelyn seized the moment, refusing to let him recover. "Not these? So all these accusations are true? At first, I wasn’t entirely sure if it was your wife and Vanessa Sterling I saw that day. But now..." She let the implication hang, sharp as a blade.

Caught off guard, Harrison floundered. "There were reasons for all of it. She was the one who made mistakes, and that’s why—"

"What mistakes?" Evelyn cut in, her voice icy.

Vanessa, sensing disaster, panicked. Harrison had a habit of oversharing under pressure. She had to intervene. "Stop deflecting. We’re talking about you spreading rumors that I fought over a dress. That never happened. Who’s manipulating you?"

Her interruption drew awkward coughs from the onlookers. Their discomfort was palpable.

Vanessa scanned the room, meeting eyes filled with silent judgment. No, the real issue isn’t the dress. The real issue was a beloved actor publicly mistreating his wife for his mistress—a disgraceful act. Yet here he stood, acting as if he were the victim.

Humiliation burned through her, making her hands tremble visibly.

Even Harrison felt the disdain radiating from the crowd. Why? I’ve done nothing wrong!

Before they could react further, Evelyn straightened, her voice dripping with disbelief. "So you’re saying it never happened? That I was set up? By whom? Your wife? Did she confess to plotting against you?"

Maxwell Thornton, desperate to stop the spiral, blurted, "Yes, she admitted she knew you!"

Evelyn scoffed. "I’m an artist who worked on the same show as her husband. Of course she knows me. I’m asking if she admitted to orchestrating this."

Silence.

Vanessa let out a disbelieving laugh. "Who would admit to that?"

Evelyn turned to her, smirking. "You really have a gift for spinning tales, don’t you? I didn’t lie, Mr. Montgomery. Who do you believe—me or her?"

The boldness of her challenge stunned the room.

Harrison gaped. "Why would I believe you over my own junior? I barely know you!"

The crowd mentally groaned. Evelyn, your argument is weak! Pivot!

But Evelyn, frustrated, snapped, "Right. If Mr. Montgomery doesn’t even trust his own wife, why would he trust a stranger like me?"

Harrison froze.

"What?"

"You give Vanessa absolute trust—no proof needed. Meanwhile, I’d need a mountain of evidence just to be heard. The hypocrisy is astounding."

Vanessa paled.

The room held its breath.

Julian Blackwood was impressed. Damn. That was brutal.

But Vanessa, ever the crisis actress, burst into tears. "I get it now. You’re against me because you think I wronged Natalie. But I swear, there’s nothing between Harrison and me! We’ve been wronged! What do I have to do to prove it? Die?"

Harrison stiffened. Vanessa had a history of self-harm. If she was innocent, why would she say such things?

Evelyn nearly laughed. Choosing logic over family? Really? The man was a master at twisting reality—and worse, he believed his own lies.

Disgust twisted in her gut. Harrison’s blind loyalty to Vanessa was nauseating.

Then—phones erupted.

The room buzzed with notifications. Harrison ignored his, but Maxwell didn’t. His face drained of color as he checked his screen, then shot Vanessa a horrified look.

Harrison, oblivious, kept defending Vanessa, glaring at Evelyn—until he noticed her widening, mocking smile.

Marcus Donovan, confused, pulled out his phone. Julian, uninterested in the digital chaos, kept his focus on Evelyn.

Even the heavens can’t stand this anymore.

The internet had spoken.

Thanks to Evelyn’s earlier stunt, netizens had dug deeper—and unearthed gold. A store employee had secretly filmed the incident, posting it online with faces blurred. The footage matched every leaked detail, exposing Vanessa’s cruelty toward Natalie.

But that wasn’t all.

Harrison and Natalie’s marriage certificate surfaced. Their childhood photos. Even a hospital snapshot of Natalie, sparking health rumors.

The backlash was vicious.

Fans of Young Again reeled. A hidden marriage? Infidelity? Mistreating a sick wife? Harrison’s reputation was obliterated.

Evelyn grinned. Best. Netizens. Ever.

Now, she just had to watch Harrison try to defend this.

Before Maxwell could drag him away, Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe rushed in—too late. The scandal had exploded.


###Chapter 69

"Mr. Montgomery! Ms. Sterling! We need answers—now!" Donovan Sharpe's voice cut through the chaos, sharp as a blade.

Harrison Montgomery and Vanessa Sterling, locked in a venomous exchange with Evelyn Sinclair, froze at the interruption. The air in the dressing room, already thick with tension, turned electric.

Every eye in the room darted between their phones and the unfolding drama, expressions shifting from shock to thinly veiled amusement. Some bit their lips to stifle laughter; others didn’t bother hiding their smirks. The scent of schadenfreude was unmistakable.

What now? Harrison’s stomach twisted. He’d assumed the scandal would fizzle out—just another baseless rumor his loyal fans would dismiss. But the way people were staring…

"Someone explain," he demanded, voice tight.

Maxwell Thornton, his manager, hesitated before offering his phone, hands shaking. The screen displayed a bombshell revelation: Vanessa, not Natalie Whitaker, had been the mastermind behind the lies.

Before Harrison could react, the projector flickered to life, casting grainy footage across the wall. The room fell silent.

"Can you even afford this, Natalie?" Vanessa’s voice, dripping with condescension, echoed through the speakers.

The footage showed two women—one unmistakably Vanessa, her signature skirt hitched up in that provocative pose she’d flaunted online. The other was Natalie, her frame so frail her clothes hung loose. The only clues to her identity were the black card in her hand and the desperation in her voice as she fumbled for her phone—only to be slapped hard across the face.

"NO!" Vanessa shrieked, her porcelain mask of composure shattering. "Turn it off! Who did this?!" She lunged for the controls, but Julian Blackwood, watching with cold amusement, had already pocketed his phone.

Moments earlier, Evelyn had mused aloud about the poetic justice of a public execution. Julian had merely taken her suggestion to heart.

The footage kept playing—Natalie’s panic, Vanessa’s cruel smirk, the damning exchange of the supplementary card. The room erupted in murmurs.

Harrison’s world tilted. He stared at Vanessa, his voice barely a whisper. "You lied to me?"

Vanessa crumpled. Tears streaked her perfect makeup as she shook her head. "It wasn’t supposed to go this far—I never meant—"

But the truth was undeniable. With a sob, she turned and fled, her entourage scrambling after her. Harrison stood rooted, fists clenched, his golden-boy image crumbling under the weight of his own naivety.

Meanwhile, Maxwell vibrated with nervous energy. Online, the scandal was exploding. Hashtags trended, memes multiplied, and the PR team was drowning. This wasn’t just a tabloid scandal—it was a morality play, and Harrison was the fool who’d bet on the wrong woman.

Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe were already strategizing, desperate to salvage My Acting Skill. The show had marketed itself as Harrison’s redemption arc—helping his former co-star rebuild her career. Now? The internet was roasting them for enabling a liar.

Vanessa had fallen. Harrison was next.

And Evelyn? She merely smiled, sipping her champagne as the dominoes toppled.

###Chapter 70
Nathan Blackwood knew with chilling clarity that if they didn’t handle this crisis perfectly, the fallout would be disastrous. He needed to pull Harrison Montgomery aside immediately to regroup, but just as he moved to do so, a sharp cough from Marcus Donovan stopped him cold—reminding him they still had an audience.

Frustration burned through Nathan like wildfire, yet he swallowed it down. Picking another fight with powerful figures now would only make things worse.

"Our apologies," Nathan said smoothly, his tone dripping with practiced diplomacy. "We acted without thorough investigation. Ms. Sinclair, please accept our sincerest regrets."

But the response from the other side was ice-cold dismissal. Nathan had no choice but to yank Harrison back to reality with an urgent tug on his arm. Harrison, jolted by the sudden pull, felt humiliation and fury rise in his chest like a storm.

How dare Evelyn, a mere rookie, demand such groveling from him? He was Harrison Montgomery—a celebrated actor, his reputation leagues above hers. What had she even lost from this misunderstanding that warranted such spectacle?

His pride had been trampled one too many times tonight. Yet under Nathan’s relentless pressure, he finally gritted out, "I’m sorry. I misunderstood."

The room held its breath. A revered actor humbling himself before a newcomer? Unheard of.

The attendees were riveted, their gazes flickering between Evelyn’s composed demeanor and Harrison’s visible struggle. Some, however, thought Evelyn had pushed far enough. Why drag this out?

But Evelyn wasn’t done.

She exhaled slowly, her voice calm but unyielding. "I’m a forgiving person. Despite being wronged, I don’t hold grudges. But one person still hasn’t apologized, so I can’t say this matter is fully resolved."

Silence.

Hold grudges? Harrison nearly choked. She started this!

Nathan had to physically steer him away before he snapped.

The planned promotional shoot for Harrison’s team collapsed. Other groups filmed as scheduled, but no one cared—the scandal had stolen all attention.

Online, chaos reigned. Die-hard fans clung to denial, but neutral observers feasted on the downfall of a once-beloved star and his mistress. Harrison and Vanessa Sterling’s past, once romanticized, now stank of deceit. Netizens dissected every rumor, their commentary growing harsher by the minute.

Back at the Blackwood estate, the evening was spent dissecting the scandal. Evelyn multitasked—chatting, scrolling, snacking—while the others pretended not to hang on her every word. After all, firsthand accounts were far juicier than tabloid speculation.

"Half the internet’s screaming insults. And some still believe in their innocence?" Evelyn scoffed. "Are their eyes just for decoration?"

The family leaned in, eager.

"Did Vanessa actually pull the suicide card?"

Gasps.

"Fake, obviously. A ploy to manipulate Harrison."

Evelyn’s lips curled in disgust. "She claimed her ‘unstable emotions’ made her lie. Blaming mental health? Did she even see a doctor? If Harrison buys this, he’s dumber than he looks."

The room vibrated with outrage.

"She threw herself at him, kissed him—and he didn’t push her away! After forever, he finally mumbled some crap about his heart belonging to Natalie. Disgusting."

Nathan’s grip on his glass tightened.

"So that’s it? A kiss, some ‘love confession,’ and suddenly Vanessa’s forgiven for everything she did to Natalie? And he had the nerve to call Natalie from Vanessa’s room? Thank God she didn’t answer—she was in a coma from medication complications! But Harrison assumed she was ignoring him? The hypocrisy!"

The Blackwoods seethed, though they’d never met these people. No wonder the internet was furious.

Then—

"Oh, this is rich." Evelyn’s eyes flashed. "Maxwell actually suggested Harrison blame everything on Natalie, divorce her, and marry Vanessa to ‘fix’ this. The audacity!"

A collective gasp.

Meanwhile, on Vanessa’s balcony, Maxwell Thornton laid out his plan with cold precision.

"Divorce Natalie. Make her publicly admit fault. Then marry Vanessa. It’s the only way out."

Harrison recoiled. "Are you insane? I only threatened divorce to scare Natalie into backing down! I never actually—"

But the damage was done.

And the world was watching.
###Chapter 71 

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of a thousand crystal chandeliers. Evelyn Sinclair adjusted her Venetian mask, the delicate silver filigree catching the light as she scanned the room. The masquerade was in full swing—aristocrats and socialites twirled across the marble floor, their laughter mingling with the orchestra’s waltz.

Nathan Blackwood stood near the balcony doors, his dark suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His mask, a sleek black half-face piece, did little to hide the intensity of his gaze as it locked onto Evelyn. She felt her pulse quicken.

Why is he watching me like that?

Victoria Hayes, ever the serpent in silk, slithered up beside him, her crimson gown a stark contrast to Evelyn’s ivory dress. She whispered something in Nathan’s ear, and his jaw tightened. Evelyn’s fingers curled into her palms.

Serena Whitmore appeared at her side, handing her a flute of champagne. "Don’t let her get to you," she murmured. "Victoria thrives on attention."

Evelyn took a sip, the bubbles sharp on her tongue. "I’m not here for drama. I just need to speak with Nathan."

Serena smirked. "Good luck with that. He’s been dodging you all evening."

Before Evelyn could retort, the music shifted—a haunting violin solo that silenced the crowd. Nathan stepped forward, his voice cutting through the hush.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, "tonight isn’t just a masquerade. It’s a game."

Murmurs rippled through the room.

"By midnight, one of you will unmask a truth that changes everything." His eyes flicked to Evelyn. "Choose wisely."

The orchestra swelled, and the guests erupted into excited chatter. Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

What truth?

Victoria’s laugh rang out, sharp as broken glass. "Oh, this should be fun."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. The clock struck eleven.

One hour left.

One hour before the masks came off—and the lies with them.

Maxwell Thornton leaned forward, his voice dripping with false sympathy. "If not for those unfortunate circumstances four years ago, you and Vanessa might have been together already. Why torture yourself with denial now?"

A shadow of unease flickered across Harrison Montgomery's face. "I would never betray Natalie. Not in a million years."

"But the court of public opinion disagrees," Maxwell countered smoothly. "The leaked footage paints a very different picture. If we don't control the narrative, both your reputation and Vanessa's career will be ruined."

Harrison remained stubbornly silent, his jaw clenched.

Seeing his resistance, Maxwell switched tactics. "Even if we position Vanessa as the villain, claiming you were merely mentoring a junior colleague, it won't be enough. People will still accuse you of impropriety. Your sponsorships are already pulling out, Harrison. The studio's stock is plummeting. No amount of righteous indignation will fix that."

"I've done nothing wrong," Harrison ground out, his knuckles whitening around his phone.

Maxwell's smile turned razor-sharp. "Innocent or not, perception is everything. The only way out is to make her the villain."

"A divorce is out of the question," Harrison snapped.

"Then what's your brilliant solution?" Maxwell threw up his hands. "That video has destroyed Vanessa's credibility. If we do nothing, she'll be crucified. She's already attempted suicide once—are you prepared to watch her try again? Or have you forgotten the debt you owe her?"

Harrison flinched as if struck. The memory of Vanessa's tear-streaked face, her trembling hands clutching a bottle of pills, sent a cold spike through his chest.

Maxwell pressed his advantage. "Natalie isn't as blameless as you think."

Harrison's head jerked up. "What are you implying?"

"Those 'hospital' photos of her looking frail?" Maxwell's smirk was venomous. "Convenient timing, don't you think? She knew you'd drop everything to rush to her side—abandoning Vanessa when she needed you most. And now, mysteriously, she's unreachable?"

A slow, sickening realization dawned in Harrison's eyes. Natalie had played him.

Maxwell leaned in, his voice a silken whisper. "She's manipulating public sympathy to force your hand. If she truly loved you, would she sabotage your career like this?"

Harrison's phone buzzed. Natalie's name flashed on the screen.

Maxwell's grin widened. "Tell her it's over. A temporary divorce—just until the scandal blows over. She's a nobody; the backlash won't touch her. But if you protect her now, you lose everything."

Harrison answered the call. Natalie's voice, usually so warm, was ice.

"I know what you're planning," she said, each word a shard of glass. "If you think I'll play the villain to save your mistress, you're delusional. I'd rather die."

The line went dead.

Harrison stared at the darkened screen, his pulse roaring in his ears.

Across the room, Maxwell exhaled sharply. "Then we do it the hard way."

Within the hour, Harrison's PR team released Natalie's medical records—a pristine report stamped "HEALTHY" in bold green letters. The date had been carefully cropped out.

The internet erupted.

"Pathetic," scoffed Sophia Blackwood, scrolling through the trending topics. "They're really trying to gaslight the world into thinking she faked an illness?"

Nathan Blackwood frowned at Evelyn Sinclair's phone. "That's last year's report. No timestamp. They're banking on people not noticing."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her device. The cruelty of it stole her breath. Harrison wasn't just betraying Natalie—he was erasing her.

And somewhere, alone in a hospital room, Natalie Whitaker was finally realizing:
Her fairytale love story had always been a lie.

###Chapter 72

Harrison Montgomery's PR team was nothing short of brilliant—masters of distortion, weaving a web of deceit with surgical precision.

After planting seeds of doubt with a fabricated health report, they unleashed a storm of condemnation online. Then, like clockwork, they released a carefully crafted statement.

First, Harrison admitted to the "mistake" of hiding his marriage. Then, they teased a grand revelation during the live broadcast, subtly framing both Harrison and Vanessa Sterling as victims.

Evelyn Sinclair scoffed. Of course. They’re using the show’s hype to spin their lies, to whitewash their sins. They hadn’t outright condemned Natalie Whitaker yet—because they were giving her one last chance. If she caved to their demands, they wouldn’t need to drag her through the mud.

The Blackwoods were stunned. They’re really going through with this?

"Surely Natalie will speak up and defend herself," Margaret gasped, horrified.

"Natalie never wanted anyone to know about her illness," Sophia murmured, her brow furrowed with worry.

"Can you talk to her, Sophia?" Genevieve suggested anxiously.

As the hospital director, Sophia felt it was her duty to check on Natalie. But when she inquired, the staff reported that Natalie had seen the news—and it had shattered her. She’d locked herself away, refusing to speak to anyone.

If Natalie wouldn’t fight for herself, no one else could step in.

The next day, the promotional videos featuring Harrison and Vanessa dropped, reigniting fan fervor like wildfire. Public opinion shifted entirely—now, they were star-crossed lovers, torn apart by fate, while Natalie was painted as the villainous wife, clinging to a dead marriage.

Though never explicitly stated, the narrative was clear. The Blackwoods were speechless.

"Why do the unfaithful always come out on top, while the loyal ones suffer?" Genevieve asked Evelyn bitterly.

Evelyn smirked. "Because the loyal ones are shackled by guilt. The heartless? They thrive on selfishness. So here’s the lesson—throwing tantrums and never reflecting on your mistakes is the real key to longevity."

Just as Evelyn was mid-rant, Marcus Donovan called with an update.

"The first performance lineup is out. Whether by chance or design, we’re up against Harrison’s team. The theme? True Love. They go first, then us. The format seems fair, but let’s be real—no one’s paying attention to us. The producers are giving Team Young Again a platform to spin their lies. The rest of us? Cannon fodder. Keep expectations low. Stick to the safe script, ride out the storm."

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed. "Did they pick us specifically to humiliate us?"

Marcus chuckled darkly.

Evelyn tapped her chin. "True Love, huh? I’ve got ideas."

On filming day, Harrison sat clutching his phone, waiting for Natalie to explode. He’d expected rage, tears, something—but silence. It unnerved him.

"Harrison, maybe we should stop. This is all my fault," Vanessa whispered, eyes glistening.

"It’s too late now," Maxwell Thornton cut in. "The show’s airing. The divorce announcement has to happen."

Harrison exhaled sharply. "She won’t even fight back. Fine. Let the lawyers handle her."

Vanessa’s gaze flickered. "What if she refuses to sign?"

Harrison stiffened. "I’ll convince her it’s temporary. Once your reputation’s cleared, I’ll cut ties with you and stay by her side forever. She’ll forgive me eventually." He even smiled. She always does.

Evelyn, eavesdropping nearby, nearly gagged. The audacity. Does he really think life will just... go back to normal?

Meanwhile, Natalie answered an unknown call.

"Ms. Whitaker? We represent Mr. Montgomery. We’d like to discuss the divorce papers..."

As the lawyer spoke, Natalie’s mind reeled. Harrison had threatened divorce before—but never like this.

What if this time… he means it?

Onstage, the lights dimmed. A haunting voice echoed through the darkness.

"Why delay treatment? Were you trying to punish them by destroying yourself?"

A single spotlight illuminated Evelyn, frail on a hospital bed.

"I... don’t know," she whispered.

"If you could choose again—your health or him? Your parents or him? A world-renowned career or him?"

The light brightened. Evelyn sat up, clarity dawning.

In her hospital room, Natalie froze.

Onstage, Harrison’s smile faltered. A photographer?

Then—SLAP!

The sound cracked through the venue. The audience gasped. The livestream comments halted.

"You cheating bastard," Evelyn snarled. "You think you’re worth ruining my life?"

The internet exploded.

And Natalie?

She finally understood.
###Chapter 73

The provocative exchange sent shockwaves through the audience, instantly sparking chaos.

Cameras zoomed in on the waiting area, where Harrison Montgomery and Vanessa Sterling sat among the other teams, their expressions dark with fury.

Are they mocking us? What does Julian and Evelyn have to do with this? Yet, they’re the ones stirring trouble. Do they really think we won’t retaliate?

The other teams exchanged glances, some amused, others wary—all sensing the brewing storm.

No one was fooled. Team Rebirth had deliberately chosen to face Team Elite, clearly aiming to humiliate them after their earlier insults.

The public was already obsessed with Harrison and Vanessa’s scandal. Their recent performance was supposed to be their grand reveal—yet here they were, overshadowed once again.

The internet was ablaze with speculation about this supposed "love story," ensuring any team pitted against Team Rebirth would be ignored.

The live broadcast was meant to boost their own fame, not waste an episode as mere background noise.

Still, many thought Julian and Evelyn had gone too far.

If you’re given an inch, don’t take a mile.

Since they couldn’t steal the spotlight, they should’ve accepted their fate gracefully. Instead, they’d thrown shade right from the start, fueling the drama. Even if it was scripted, the backlash would be brutal.

Not only had they failed to gain attention—they’d invited criticism. It was like they wanted the backlash.

The backstage guests and audience cringed on their behalf.

Interest in the upcoming performance dwindled. At most, Julian and Evelyn would make a brief appearance before their actual act. What everyone really wanted to see was the inevitable confrontation afterward.

Only Richard, Margaret, and Genevieve remained riveted, their eyes gleaming with anticipation.

On stage, the scene shifted—now resembling a school play. Evelyn and Julian took the lead roles.

The two families were neighbors, the boy and girl growing up side by side.

In elementary school, he brought her breakfast every morning. In middle school, he rode his bike to pick her up. In high school, they studied together, sharing laughter and tears. From carefree childhood to the first sparks of romance, they were each other’s world.

One pursued acting, rising in the entertainment industry. The other traveled with a camera, her photos gracing prestigious magazines.

The stage’s backdrop split into two scenes. On the left, a young man’s journey—his relentless acting grind, his triumphant award win.

On the right, breathtaking landscapes—mountains, oceans, snowfields—each photo pulsing with life. Awards and magazine features lined the display.

Evelyn’s acting was stiff, but the story was undeniably compelling.

Another tale of childhood sweethearts—but with a twist. Unlike Team Elite’s clingy wife narrative, this was a story of equals, thriving independently.

It felt like a direct challenge.

The audience sat straighter, electrified. No one had expected Julian and Evelyn to be this bold.

Are they exploiting the drama for attention?

Holy hell, this is better than reality TV. It’s about to get messy!

Online comments exploded. Fans who’d been ready to drag Julian and Evelyn now leaned forward, hooked.

The production team panicked. This wasn’t in the script!

They scrambled to intervene—until they heard the live viewership had surpassed Team Elite’s numbers and was still climbing.

One photo lingered—a lone polar bear under the northern lights.

She’d spent a month in the Arctic Circle for that shot.

I used to have such fire… What happened to me?

Natalie Whitaker’s breath hitched, her chest tightening. The words echoed in her mind:

"Between being a world-renowned photographer and him—who would you choose?"

Harrison and Vanessa trembled—hers with rage, his with something darker.

For Harrison, it was like a hammer to the chest. The performance was exaggerated, but the core was true. He recognized those photos.

Then came the realization—Natalie must have orchestrated this. She’d waited for this moment.

She’s working with Julian and Evelyn. This is revenge.

Even now, he couldn’t accept that the woman who’d once loved him so deeply would strike back.

Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe it’s just a coincidence.

But it didn’t matter. Public opinion favored the side with more fans.

And right now? The fans were loving the show.
###Chapter 74

The stage performance continued, with supporting actors stepping in to portray the two joyful elders clapping from the sidelines.

The young man dropped to one knee. "Marry me. Be my wife."

The young woman looked stunned. "But in the entertainment industry, isn't it better for one's career to marry later?"

Yet the man insisted, "You're the one I want in my life, no matter what. Sooner or later makes no difference. We can keep it secret if you prefer, though I know that’s unfair to you."

The woman hesitated, but seeing the delight on their parents' faces and the sincerity in his eyes, she finally nodded in agreement.

In an instant, the images of the female lead's life on the right side of the massive screen shattered into fragmented black-and-white scenes. They shrank and shifted upward, making space for new images below—charts of company stocks, rising and falling like waves.

The man performed on stage with a group, while the woman sat in an office, buried under paperwork, phone pressed to her ear. The scene painted a picture of a couple managing their careers side by side.

Then, abruptly, the performance between them ended. All light vanished, converging solely on Evelyn. Breaking free from her role, she stepped forward and delivered a sharp slap to Julian, who stood shrouded in darkness.

It was as if her future self had stormed back to confront the scoundrel.

"You proposed to me because you were afraid I’d chase my dream of becoming a photographer and leave you behind. You couldn’t bear the thought of losing me, so you trapped me—stripped me of my freedom, forced me to live in your shadow, to be nothing but your dutiful wife. I was a fool, believing love meant sacrifice, compromise, and surrender. But tell me—after I gave up everything for your career, how could you abandon me? Where is your conscience?"

Evelyn’s voice was raw from shouting. She unleashed a torrent of accusations, each word dripping with fury.

Though the performance was unpolished, the audience was riveted. Even if they couldn’t separate truth from fiction, they were eager to dissect every detail.

The truth was clear: it wasn’t the parents who had rushed them into marriage, nor had Harrison simply gone through the motions. No—he had been the one to propose, begging Natalie to stay, to sacrifice for him. And after she did, he never considered divorce. She hadn’t clung to him—she had supported him with everything she had.

Yet Harrison still claimed he owed her nothing. The lie was sickening.

If Team A-List was performing the truth, then Team Young Again’s so-called "clarification" was nothing but a twisted farce.

There was nothing crueler than a heartless man. She had given him everything, and in return, he betrayed her for his mistress. The crowd seethed.

Not only were the live spectators stunned, but the online comments had exploded into chaos. Half were curses, the other half frantic speculation.

People scoured YouTube for evidence.

In the hospital room, Natalie listened to Evelyn’s final monologue, her eyes wide with realization. That’s right. I was going to leave. I hesitated because we were in love—but why was I the one who had to sacrifice from the start? If Harrison truly loved me, shouldn’t he have supported my dreams too?

Some things shouldn’t be examined too closely—like cold, unfeeling math. Because once you did, the truth became unbearable.

But when someone took another’s sacrifices for granted, when they grew numb to kindness and forgot gratitude—they no longer deserved a single ounce of devotion.

Backstage, Harrison felt as if he’d been slapped a thousand times. The stark contrast between the two versions of events left him furious, humiliated, barely holding onto his composure.

His frustration at the truth being exposed faded—all he wanted was to deny it. In love, someone has to compromise. How else do two people become husband and wife? I only wanted to act—I had no choice!

Margaret and Richard watched as the audience whispered among themselves, some glancing at the backstage live feed where the rebellious cameraman had boldly zoomed in on Harrison and Vanessa.

Everyone studied their expressions. Is that discomfort from being exposed—or anger at false accusations?

On stage, a special guest joined the performance.

Lillian realized then that Evelyn and Julian had kept parts of the script from Marcus. She almost pitied him—he’d only been trying to recruit more staff. Now, who would dare work with such troublesome artists?

As they spoke, Maxwell stormed over, livid. "What the hell are you doing? Stop this now!"

It seemed the mistress was about to make her entrance. Were they really going to act out the whole scandal?

This bold move was unprecedented in the entertainment industry. Preston and Donovan were practically vibrating with excitement. The live chat erupted into chaos.

The second female lead smiled sweetly. "Thank you."

The woman at the desk remained absorbed in her work, oblivious.

Then, four elderly figures appeared before the second lead.

The man continued performing, ignoring the disruption. The second lead exited, vanishing for a time.

The woman worked tirelessly, but as the documents piled higher, she grew overwhelmed. Eventually, she enlisted help, stepping further from the spotlight. The company’s image on the screen faded, replaced by a hospital room where her parents lay.

She reappeared, now caring for them.

Only after her parents were gone did the second lead return, throwing herself into the man’s arms in tears. Both turned to glare at the woman, eyes burning with resentment.

The lighting shifted again. Evelyn stepped away and delivered another slap.

"You hypocrite! You claim we had nothing in common—but you were the one who refused to share my interests. I could have been an artist, but you turned me into a money machine. And then you dare blame me for your infidelity? If you couldn’t commit, you should never have proposed!"

Another slap. "You accused me of driving her away with my power—but I didn’t even know her then! You kept saying I owed her. What nonsense! She worked for our company—she knew you were married. Since when is seducing a married man considered true love? Soulmates? More like two rotten souls!"

She spun and struck again. "And you—you’re truly shameless. Were you forced to leave? No. The elders gave you a choice because they saw you trying to break up a family. You chose to go abroad for your career. If you were really forced, why didn’t you ever contact this scoundrel for help?"

Evelyn sneered at the shadows. "You had every opportunity abroad, yet you failed. Then you came back and dragged him into blaming me? What, upset I didn’t step aside so you could be the mistress? Should I have handed you a successful career too?"

The live feed cut out. YouTube’s servers crashed. The audience erupted.

Those four slaps had landed—hard. Their faces paled, bodies swaying, pupils shrinking to pinpricks.

The truth was out. And there was no taking it back.
###Chapter 75

The live chat exploded with die-hard fans spamming the feed, making it lag like a slideshow.

Were these netizens truly brainwashed, or was it all just empty bravado? The backlash was brutal—nothing but vicious insults flooding the screen.

Even the classic line, "The one who wasn’t loved was the other woman," popped up in the comments.

Twitter erupted with trending hashtags slamming the situation. Even Julian, despite his A-list status, found the heat unbearable.

But soon, different voices took over.

People weren’t fools. When Evelyn tore into them, she laid out her arguments with razor-sharp logic. Unless someone was in denial, the truth was undeniable.

Upon closer inspection, Team Rebirth’s entire narrative was built on shaky emotional manipulation—it couldn’t hold up under scrutiny.

The live audience, watching from the waiting area, couldn’t help but comment on the expressions of the two in question.

"Heartless men are masters at making excuses. Just watching their earlier behavior makes me question their morals. If they didn’t love her, why marry her in the first place?"

"Exactly. Marriage means commitment. Using 'true love' as an excuse for cheating is disgusting."

"If this is true, then Natalie wasn’t just some spoiled heiress. She stood by Harrison during his rise, supporting him unconditionally. And once they succeeded, she stepped back to care for her parents—only for Team Rebirth to smear her name when she was out of the public eye."

"Back then, I was a fan of Vanessa. She left for overseas with everyone’s blessings, landed a huge project, then vanished after marriage. She clearly had resources—how is that anyone else’s fault?"

"This is chilling. Could Harrison really lie so shamelessly? I used to admire him."

"Team Elite has guts. Who gave them this kind of courage?"

Richard and Margaret sat among the crowd, listening as the tide turned in Evelyn and Julian’s favor. They exchanged satisfied glances.

In the waiting area, the weight of everyone’s stares made the two at the center feel ice crawl down their spines.

Harrison had been verbally shredded to the point of dizziness. He’d never been this disheveled before.

His mind was chaos. He didn’t even question if Evelyn and Julian had fabricated anything—he just turned to Vanessa, voice strained.

"You told me Natalie forced you out. So how could she not even know you?"

Guilt had eaten at him for years, seeing Vanessa’s downfall. He’d blamed himself for overreacting, ruining her life—even though he never meant to.

Vanessa, meanwhile, was shaking with rage. How did Evelyn know so much? Some details were buried so deep—was this really a coincidence?

When Harrison questioned her, panic flashed in her eyes. Lips trembling, she defended herself. "The elders came to me saying it was for Natalie. Doesn’t that mean she was behind it?"

Harrison opened his mouth but couldn’t speak. His head pounded, his breath tight. "So… it’s possible Natalie really didn’t know?"

Vanessa scoffed. "We were the hottest duo back then. How could she not know? She ran the company—she had to be aware of her own artists!"

She still believed Natalie had sent those elders after her.

But Harrison hesitated. That was Natalie’s transitional period—she was handing over management. "I can’t say for sure she was paying attention to me then."

Still, part of him wanted to believe Vanessa. "Everyone shipped us. She must have known, right?"

"Evelyn’s acting isn’t bad," someone lied through their teeth, watching her raw, unpolished performance. It was pure emotion—zero technique.

Since the live mic was off, only visuals transmitted. The cameras focused solely on Harrison and Vanessa, catching her near-meltdown and his visible distress.

It only made things look worse for them.

Backstage, Maxwell scrambled to contact Preston and Donovan, desperate to get Harrison and Vanessa offstage to strategize damage control.

But what difference would it make?

If Evelyn and Julian dared claim this was the truth without proof, Maxwell could always sue.

In the hospital room, Sophia—like the rest of the Blackwoods—already had an idea of the truth from Evelyn’s thoughts. But watching her and Julian’s performance was still electrifying. Even Harrison’s lawyer sat frozen, forgetting to work.

Natalie, lying in bed, stared at the screen.

"That’s right… What did I do wrong? They were the guilty ones. So why am I the one suffering?"

Meanwhile, the final act began.
###Chapter 76

The scene unfolded with Vanessa Sterling sneaking a phone call, pretending Evelyn Sinclair had reached out to her. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the stage, Evelyn stood in a hospital corridor, clutching a medical report, her face pale as she frantically consulted a doctor.

Vanessa tore at her designer dress dramatically, begging Julian Blackwood for help. At the same time, Evelyn, tears streaming down her face, desperately tried calling Julian—only for him to ignore her, too busy rushing to Vanessa’s rescue.

By the time Julian arrived, he stood before Vanessa, his expression cold as he turned to Evelyn. "You’re vile for trying to frame—"

Evelyn defended herself, but Julian scoffed, freezing her black card mid-sentence. When she mentioned her illness, he sneered, "Stop faking. You’re not fooling anyone."

Left alone, Evelyn collapsed, weakened by her condition. Yet, someone snapped a photo of her vulnerable state and uploaded it online.

Later, Julian and Vanessa cornered Evelyn. "You’re just a nobody," Julian spat. "We’re stars. Sacrificing you is the easiest way to clear our names. Since you claim to love me, you’ll do this for me, won’t you? Or I’ll divorce you."

The lighting remained unchanged, but Evelyn—who had been playing the role of a frail patient—suddenly sprang from her wheelchair like a woman possessed.

SLAP!

Her palm cracked against Julian’s cheek, sending him stumbling back. Before Vanessa could react, Evelyn backhanded her so hard she crashed into Julian’s arms. Then, Evelyn fake-stomped on them both, her movements sharp and theatrical.

"Pathetic, spineless liars!" she seethed. "You accuse me without proof? Even the police need evidence, but you two think you’re above the law? Maybe I should hand you over to the authorities—oh wait, they don’t take trash!"

The audience gasped.

"Wait…" someone murmured. "Did Harrison Montgomery really believe Vanessa’s lies about Natalie without proof?"

"Let’s see if they dare present any evidence later," another whispered.

Backstage, Harrison and Vanessa overheard the murmurs. Harrison’s face went rigid. I don’t have proof, but…

On stage, Julian finally found his voice. "You don’t have proof of your innocence either!"

Evelyn fake-stomped his face so convincingly that Julian genuinely wondered if she’d break character and kick him for real.

"Are you hearing yourself?" she snapped. "You demand proof from your wife but take a stranger’s word as gospel? Because she’s delicate? Because her tears make her innocent? If she accuses me of murder tomorrow, will you send me to prison? Just because I don’t cry, I’m the villain?"

SLAP!

"You think because you didn’t sleep with her, you’re still faithful? Still honorable?"

Julian’s acting was flawless—his neck just wasn’t used to all the head-turning. Still, he perfectly portrayed a man drowning in self-righteous anger.

Evelyn leaned in, her voice dripping with venom. "Tell me, Julian. If I found another man and did everything you did with her, but swore I still loved you… would you be okay with that?"

His face twisted in rage.

"Hypocrite," she spat. "Your ‘love’ is disgusting. I must’ve been a monster in my past life to deserve it."

Suddenly, Harrison clutched his chest, gasping for air. He slumped against the wall, his vision blurring. Vanessa could only watch helplessly, her facade crumbling.

Backstage, eyes gleamed with predatory interest. The vultures were circling.

On screen, Evelyn’s tirade continued—until BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! censored her words.

The audience groaned. "Why’s she censoring herself? We want to hear the insults!"

But the Blackwood family in the crowd smirked. They loved her unfiltered rage.

As the lights dimmed, a single spotlight remained. Evelyn’s voice echoed softly.

"Without you, I might’ve met someone who truly loved me. Someone who chose me. But even if I don’t… I’ll take all the love I wasted on you and give it to myself."

The crowd fell silent.

They’d expected a petty feud—not a raw, powerful message about self-worth.

Just as they thought it was over, Evelyn’s voice returned, playful yet sharp.

"Life’s boring without a few lunatics to stomp on. So look ahead… because a new Chapter’s just begun."

The stage went black.

And the audience erupted.

###Chapter 77

The premiere episode of "The Art of Performance" had taken the entertainment world by storm, with viewership numbers skyrocketing beyond expectations.

When Evelyn Sinclair and Julian Blackwood took the stage with their team to thank the audience, the applause was deafening. Richard and Margaret Blackwood waved enthusiastically from their seats, their faces glowing with pride.

Judging by the electrifying atmosphere in the theater, it was clear that netizens were already buzzing with reactions.

The broadcast cut to the waiting area, where the host was interviewing other guests about their thoughts on the performances.

Each guest offered a half-hearted critique before hastily excusing themselves, their poorly concealed excitement giving them away. If not for their barely suppressed grins, the audience might have believed they were rushing to the restroom.

One comment flashed across the screen: "OMG! They're totally sneaking backstage to gossip!"

Another chimed in: "Excuse me, but as a VVVIP viewer, I demand to see everything! Take us backstage NOW!"

A third added: "Team Rising Stars left earlier, and Team Elite just wrapped up. The backstage drama must be chef's kiss right now."

Yet another fan pleaded: "Let us in! We want the tea!"

The host, visibly distracted, continued her interviews while stealing glances at the live comments. She wished she could ditch her duties and join the backstage frenzy. Damn professionalism.

With all the guests mysteriously vanishing, she had no choice but to turn to the panel of acting coaches from the prestigious drama academy. But even they seemed preoccupied, constantly refreshing their Twitter feeds.

The play—and the ensuing scandal—had dominated the top ten trending topics. Every update sent shockwaves through social media, making it impossible for even the most powerful PR teams to contain the fallout.

At this point, only the most delusional fans were still defending their idols. The rest of the world had already pieced together the truth.

Strip away the façade of "true love," and the story was nothing more than a cheating husband and his mistress conspiring against his loyal wife.

Just as the public had once shipped the couple, they were now on a mission to expose the scumbag and his homewrecker.

Backstage, Harrison Montgomery looked utterly lost, drowning in self-doubt. His manager, Maxwell Thornton, however, was scrambling to salvage what little remained of Harrison’s reputation.

After all, concrete evidence was scarce. The play had merely amplified the whispers.

Maxwell’s strategy was simple: have Harrison deny everything and claim Natalie Whitaker was merely lashing out in heartbreak. If they stuck to the script, Harrison could still walk away unscathed.

Maxwell refused to believe Evelyn and Julian’s performance was genuine. To him, it was all an elaborate setup—a carefully orchestrated smear campaign.

In the cutthroat world of showbiz, the oldest trick in the book was mixing truth with lies. And he was convinced Natalie had done exactly that.

Harrison, however, seemed oblivious to the chaos around him. His mind was stuck on Evelyn’s scathing words. Have I really hurt Natalie that badly? I just… strayed for a moment. How did things spiral so out of control?

Evelyn nearly laughed out loud. Oh, please.

Julian shot Maxwell a withering glare. "A setup? You’re the ones who’ve been manipulating the narrative."

Maxwell stiffened, as if someone had just yanked his tie too tight.

The bystanders bit their lips to keep from laughing.

"Do you really think you’ve won?" Maxwell sneered. "You have no proof. Don’t forget—Natalie is still Harrison’s wife. Married couples fight, but they always make up. If she had real dirt on him, she would’ve exposed it by now. Face it—you’re just her pawns. Once they reconcile, you’ll be the ones left looking like villains."

What a load of crap. Evelyn smirked. He can’t even reach Natalie, yet he’s trying to gaslight us? Too bad for him… the wheels are already in motion.

The Blackwoods exchanged knowing glances. What wheels?

The others, however, looked uneasy.

He has a point… If Julian and Evelyn are helping Natalie, why hasn’t she given them anything concrete? Is this just a messy lovers’ quarrel? Ugh.

Harrison’s eyes suddenly lit up, his cheeks flushing with renewed confidence.

She still loves me. She’s just hurt. This is all a test—a way to force me to beg for forgiveness. I knew she wouldn’t actually destroy me.

It was unclear if Harrison was truly this delusional or just desperate, but his self-deception gave him the courage to stride toward Julian and Evelyn.

"Natalie and I will work things out," he declared. "She’ll clear my name. So I suggest you two stop meddling in our marriage."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll.

After everything you’ve done, you still expect her to save you? Oh, just wait. Your little fantasy won’t last long.

###Chapter 78

Marcus Donovan was visibly concerned. He couldn't help but question Julian Blackwood about his intentions. Julian glanced at Evelyn Sinclair, reassuring her, "Relax, everything's under control."

Meanwhile, the audience buzzed with skepticism and confusion.

If Natalie Whitaker could actually be swayed by Harrison Montgomery's sweet talk, would she just become their pawn? That would be truly pathetic.

At that moment, director Preston Whitmore and producer Donovan Sharpe rushed over, their foreheads glistening with sweat. They were at a loss, unable to distinguish truth from fiction. All they could do was let events unfold naturally. Regardless, they were determined to capitalize on this unexpected surge in viewership.

The next step was for both teams to take the stage and announce the results.

The scoring would be based on both the judges' evaluations and audience votes.

Before the scoring began, the two groups were given a chance to speak. Meanwhile, the massive screen behind them transformed into a live comment feed. At a glance, most comments were tearing into Team Young Again.

Netizen A: Even if he was wrong for changing his heart, he went ahead and trampled all over her. He's the lowest of the low.

Netizen B: Compared to outright villains, it's the ones who think they've done nothing wrong who are truly disgusting.

Netizen C: How dare he talk about divorcing Natalie? She should leave him ASAP! She’s better off alone!

Netizen D: Why is my girlfriend tagging me nonstop? I’d never behave like this. If I treated my wife this way, I’d rather twist my own head off!

However, thanks to Maxwell Thornton’s last-minute intervention and the hired PR team, some support remained for them. The flood of negative comments didn’t completely drown them out—there were still voices defending Team Young Again.

Netizen E: Nobody has proof! Stop jumping to conclusions! I believe Harrison and Vanessa had no choice.

Netizen F: I bet Natalie is forcing Harrison to stay with her. Otherwise, why would she hide? She just can’t let go.

Netizen G: True love is innocent!

Following protocol, Team A-List spoke first.

Both Julian and Evelyn gave generic, polite remarks. In reality, Evelyn was too busy absorbing the unfolding drama, while Julian was intently eavesdropping.

At that moment, no one noticed that the live comments were subtly introducing new information, rapidly taking over the screen with repetition.

Then, it was Team Young Again’s turn.

Vanessa Sterling stepped forward, eyes red and teary, looking like she’d been wronged. Harrison, on the other hand, maintained his composed demeanor, untouched by the chaos around him—like the seasoned actor he was.

When the mic was passed to him, Harrison simply said, "The innocent have nothing to fear."

Yet, after he spoke, an eerie silence fell over the venue. The audience kept glancing between their phones and the stage, their expressions shifting.

Harrison frowned and reluctantly handed the mic to Vanessa.

Choking back tears, Vanessa whispered, "I’m sorry for causing trouble, but I have no regrets." She bowed, her face the picture of silent suffering.

The comments section exploded with support: Don’t let others dictate your happiness!

Evelyn scoffed internally: Happiness? More like not caring when people slap you in the face.

Julian, standing nearby, was momentarily stunned. Before he could process what was happening, a figure stormed onto the stage.

Before anyone could react—SLAP!

A sharp crack echoed as Vanessa was struck so hard she stumbled. Harrison instinctively caught her.

This was supposed to be a live broadcast, but the audience, already bombarded with scandalous revelations, was too stunned to react. No one moved to stop the intruder or cut the mic.

So everyone heard Harrison’s shocked exclamation: "Mom?! What are you doing here?"

Lawrence Montgomery had also rushed forward, kicking Harrison twice. Supporting Beatrice Montgomery, who trembled with rage, he snapped, "Harrison, do you think this is fair to Natalie’s parents? We’re ashamed of you! You’ve betrayed your wife for this mistress! How could we raise a son who can’t tell right from wrong? We owe Natalie and her family an apology!"

Harrison was stunned. Why wouldn’t his parents believe him?

This was just a temporary arrangement!

Unbeknownst to him, his parents had been on a cruise with limited internet access. The moment they disembarked, they were bombarded with the live broadcast. Unable to reach Natalie, they’d rushed to the scene, hoping their son would come to his senses.

Instead, they found Harrison and Vanessa still playing their roles. Enraged, Lawrence and Beatrice lost all restraint.

Beatrice glared at her son, who was still holding the sobbing Vanessa, and hissed, "Years ago, we let you leave peacefully—that was mercy enough. Yet here you are, unchanged, seducing another woman’s husband!"

She viciously yanked Vanessa’s hair and slapped her twice.

Harrison quickly intervened. "Mom, Dad, stop! Did Natalie send you?"

"You’re still defending her? You’re utterly bewitched!" Beatrice cried out in frustration. "If we’d known you’d be this stubborn, we never would’ve covered for you back then!"

Harrison froze. A sudden wave of panic hit him—especially when the screen flooded with comments: Support Natalie’s divorce! Dump the trash! Love yourself!

Divorce? A pretend divorce? Wait—

Harrison’s blood ran cold. He frantically dialed Natalie’s number, but no one answered.

"She’s avoiding us. What do we do now?" Lawrence muttered.

Harrison immediately called his lawyer.

But before he could speak, the lawyer cut in: "Congratulations, Mr. Montgomery. Ms. Whitaker has already signed the divorce papers."

The words echoed through the microphone, silencing the entire room. Even the live comments paused.

"No—that’s not real! We’re not actually divorcing! Did you explain it to her?" Harrison’s voice cracked, his composure shattered.

The lawyer replied calmly, "I fulfilled your request, though Ms. Whitaker didn’t seem to agree. She’s already authorized us to handle the asset division."

Harrison paled. "No! Destroy the agreement! We’re not—"

"I’m sorry, Mr. Montgomery," the lawyer interrupted. "Due to Ms. Whitaker’s insistence, legal proceedings have already begun. It’s irreversible."

Harrison’s hands shook. Fear and regret clawed at him. Desperately, he tried to salvage the situation.

"She misunderstood! Let me talk to her—hand her the phone!"

The lawyer sighed. "Ms. Whitaker is currently in surgery and will be unreachable for the next ten hours. By the time she wakes, the divorce will be finalized. Also… given the high-risk nature of the procedure, she’s arranged her estate. You may want to prepare for the inheritance settlement."

Harrison’s world spun. "What? What are you saying?"

"You weren’t aware? Ms. Whitaker has been ill for months. She’s been hospitalized this whole time."

The room’s silence was no longer one of shock, but of horrified realization. The performances by Evelyn and Julian hadn’t been exaggerated at all.

Was it really that serious?

The comments exploded again.

Netizen P: OMG—I just found a diagnosis certificate and surgical consent form from XX Hospital, signed by Natalie herself. The surgery is today.

###Chapter 79

The studio lights blazed mercilessly as Harrison Montgomery stood frozen, his phone pressed to his ear. The voice on the other end was raw with fury.

"She's sick, Harrison! Natalie is sick, and you didn’t even know! I swear, if anything happens to her—" Lawrence Montgomery’s voice cracked, thick with emotion.

Beatrice Montgomery, her face streaked with tears, stepped forward and slapped her son hard across the face. The sound echoed through the silent studio. "Her parents are gone, and you were all she had! How could you let this happen?"

Harrison staggered back, his mind reeling. The live audience gasped, their murmurs swelling into a wave of condemnation.

Maxwell Thornton, his manager, rushed forward, pleading with the producers to cut the broadcast. But Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe exchanged glances—this was ratings gold. The truth was out, and they weren’t about to stop it now.

"I didn’t know," Harrison whispered, his voice hollow. "She never told me—"

From the sidelines, Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood exchanged incredulous looks.

"Pathetic," Julian Blackwood muttered, crossing his arms. "All that grandstanding earlier, and now he’s playing the victim?"

The phone call continued, and suddenly, another voice cut through—Sophia Blackwood, Nathan’s sharp-tongued sister.

"Lawrence, are you seriously trying to twist this now? Natalie called you from the hospital. The doctors heard everything. You accused her of faking it, remember?"

Harrison’s breath hitched. The memory slammed into him—Natalie’s weak voice, his own dismissive scoff. "You’re just jealous of Vanessa. Stop making up lies."

Sophia’s voice was ice. "Tell me, Harrison—did Natalie make a habit of lying about her health? Or were you just too wrapped up in your little affair to care?"

The audience erupted.

Netizen Q: I thought I was watching a love story. Turns out it’s a horror show.

Netizen R: Where are all the Harrison-Vanessa shippers now? Come out and apologize!

Netizen S: I take back every nice thing I ever said about him. Disgusting.

Netizen T: Get him off the screen. Now.

Harrison’s lawyer’s voice crackled through the speaker. "Mr. Montgomery, the divorce papers are legally binding. You signed them first. Natalie has chosen to proceed."

The final nail in the coffin.

Netizen U: Oh, the irony. He thought he could manipulate her into a fake divorce, and now she’s the one walking away.

Netizen V: Vanessa must have really scrambled his brain. Who does that to their wife?

Lawrence and Beatrice, their grief turning to rage, dragged Harrison offstage. The moment he was gone, the screen flooded with one unanimous verdict:

"THE MISTRESS HAS NO SHAME!"

Vanessa Sterling, unable to bear the onslaught, burst into tears and fled.

Team A-list stood alone on stage, victorious by default.

Later, curled up on Nathan’s couch, Evelyn scrolled through the aftermath.

"They’re still denying it," she murmured, shaking her head. "Even with all the evidence."

Nathan smirked. "Some people never learn."

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over one last headline before she drifted off to sleep:

"NATALIE WHITAKER: THE TRUTH BEHIND THE AMNESIA SCANDAL."


###Chapter 80 

The moment they dropped the bombshell news, Margaret and Genevieve watched Evelyn with bated breath.

Sure enough, the next second, Evelyn's unfiltered thoughts blared through their minds like a siren.

Amnesia? Seriously? Let me check—oh my god, it's true! And not just any amnesia—the dramatic kind where she only forgot one person! She’s completely erased Harrison from her memory!

Margaret and Genevieve exchanged glances, thinking the same thing. Sophia and the doctors are still investigating, but of course Evelyn gets the gossip first. This is wild. Natalie only forgot Harrison?

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s mind was racing. How much must someone despise another person for their own mind to wipe out every trace of love and hate tied to them? But wait—doesn’t this make her vulnerable to Harrison’s manipulations? What if he shamelessly tries to win her back? Ugh!

Margaret and Genevieve mentally echoed her concerns.

What do we do? I’m dying to know—how will Harrison react when he faces Natalie, who doesn’t remember him?

The three of them locked eyes, mischief dancing in their gazes.

"I’ve never actually visited Sophia at work," Evelyn mused casually.

Margaret and Genevieve shook their heads—neither had they.

"Should we go see her together?" Evelyn suggested.

Within minutes, they were ready, speeding toward the hospital. Only after arriving did they call Sophia down to meet them.

Sophia, however, was already buzzing with excitement. "Come with me, quick! The Montgomerys are already here!"

And so, the four meddlers marched toward Natalie’s hospital room, pretending to be concerned visitors.

As they reached the door, Harrison’s voice—raw with emotion—drifted out. "Natalie, do you really not remember me? I’m your husband!"

The quartet shuddered, their concern deepening.

But Natalie’s voice, bright and sharp, cut through the tension. "I don’t recall you, but I’m not stupid. I know you’re Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery’s son, and we were childhood sweethearts who got married. But we’re divorced now. I have photos of the divorce papers and property settlement on my phone, and there’s a wedding ring in the trash. So don’t try to trick me—you’re nothing but my ex-husband."

"That was a misunderstanding! We were only supposed to have a fake divorce—"

"Enough." Natalie’s tone was ice. "Whatever your intentions were, I know myself. I don’t play games, and I don’t make rash decisions. Even if I don’t remember, I trust my past judgment. If I let you go, it meant I didn’t want you. End of story. Don’t even think about manipulating me—it won’t work."

When Evelyn and the others entered, they were struck by Natalie’s expression—serious, unwavering. Despite the bandages wrapped around her head, her eyes were sharp, alive. She wasn’t the same woman who had once orbited Harrison’s every move.

Instead, the moment she noticed Evelyn, her face lit up.

"Ah, Ms. Sinclair! Hello! I remember you—you helped me at the mall, and I’ve seen you online. Thank you for that performance—it helped me so much." Her smile was radiant, genuine.

Evelyn grinned. "I heard you woke up, so I came to visit."

Who knew that without Harrison in her life, she’d be this vibrant?

The Blackwood siblings were equally stunned. It was like meeting a completely different person.

Natalie sighed, rubbing her temples. "Honestly, I don’t know what I ever saw in him. I could never be with someone I don’t love, especially after everything he did to hurt me. Just looking at him makes me sick. If he keeps showing up, I might need another surgery."

The quartet barely suppressed their laughter.

"Harrison," Natalie said firmly, "let’s bury the past. Walk away now, and I might still think kindly of you." She waved a dismissive hand. "Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, please take him away. I need peace to recover."

Harrison swayed, as if struck. "Natalie! Please—I realize my mistakes now! You’re the only woman I’ve ever loved! Everyone else was just—"

"Really?" Natalie arched a brow, picking up her phone. With a few taps, she began reading aloud. "October 10th. Finally figured out why Harrison’s been distant. He got drunk, grabbed me, and shouted, ‘Vanessa, don’t leave!’ Then he kissed me. I was disgusted. He never calls me Nat, so I looked into it—turns out, a woman named Vanessa left him a year ago."

Harrison paled, his entire body trembling.

The quartet’s expressions twisted in disgust.

"And you still claim I’m the only one?" Natalie scoffed before continuing. "October 12th. Decided not to tell Harrison I’m pregnant. I can’t keep this baby—it wouldn’t be fair to bring it into this mess. He doesn’t deserve to be a father."

The air turned to stone.

Harrison choked, his eyes red. "A baby? We had a baby?"

Natalie met his gaze, cold and unflinching. "Not anymore."

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 81

Harrison Montgomery had never imagined, even in his wildest dreams, that they could have shared a child together.

His parents were equally devastated. Beatrice Montgomery nearly collapsed, but Lawrence caught her just in time.

That child—had it survived—would have been four years old now.

Lost.

The Blackwoods stood frozen in shock.

Evelyn Sinclair could hardly believe she had missed such a scandalous piece of gossip. Her system only revealed information when she actively sought it; it never volunteered secrets on its own.

Did this really happen? Let me check… Oh my god, it’s true!

In reality, the reason they hadn’t conceived for years was because both had been too exhausted, too consumed by their careers to even consider pregnancy. That they had managed to conceive at all was nothing short of a miracle.

But knowing Natalie Whitaker, she would never have carried a child unless she was certain of their love. She wasn’t the type to use a baby as a pawn to trap a man. To her, an unwanted child would have been nothing but a chain.

"Why… why didn’t you keep it? Why didn’t you tell me?" Harrison clutched his head, his voice breaking. "If I had known, I would have—I made one mistake, just one! You should have given me the chance to fix it!"

Natalie sighed, her expression unreadable. "Back then, staying married was me giving you a chance. But the outcome proved my instincts right. You still failed me."

In marriage, people strayed. Sometimes, out of love or fear, the other partner forgave. But forgiveness had its limits.

She had once been a force of nature, standing beside Harrison as he built his empire. If not for his betrayal and the sudden loss of her parents, she would have walked away sooner.

Evelyn couldn’t help but sympathize internally, while the Blackwood women nodded subtly in agreement.

Natalie’s revelation wasn’t just a product of her amnesia—it was her final act of severing ties.

Harrison trembled violently, veins bulging at his temples. "Natalie, I won’t give up on you. I love you. I’ll make up for my mistakes. I’ll court you all over again, and I’ll wait as long as it takes—"

That line sounds familiar, Evelyn thought dryly.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances, reminded of a certain unfortunate soul.

Julian Blackwood, currently in a meeting with Marcus Donovan, sneezed violently.

"Enough." Natalie’s voice was ice. "I don’t care what you think. I’ve said my piece. Leave now, or I will call the police for harassment."

She leveled him with a glare. "I’m not joking."

The coldness in her eyes silenced him.

Lawrence looked ready to intervene, but Natalie cut him off. "I respect my elders, but if they manipulate my emotions for their own gain—if they expect me to suffer just to please others—then that respect ends. I’ve already died once. My parents are gone. Now, I live for me."

The statement mirrored the theme of Evelyn’s recent performance.

Lawrence swallowed his words, supporting Beatrice as they left in defeat.

Harrison refused to budge, determined to be a nuisance—but there was no need for the police. They were already divorced. Sophia Blackwood had every right to escort him out.

How pathetic. If even Julian couldn’t pull this off, what made Harrison think he could? I’d eat my hat if he succeeded.

Before they arrived, Natalie had already reactivated her network of freelance photographers. With no ties left—only regret for wasted years—she was now single-mindedly chasing her dreams. Evelyn suspected she’d leave the country the moment she was discharged.

Even if Harrison tried to chase her, he wouldn’t know where to look. His past indifference had ensured he knew nothing of her professional circle. Once she vanished, he’d have no one to ask.

Hah. Poetic justice.

For now, he clung to hope. But soon, he’d have nothing but despair.

At the hospital entrance, the nuisance hadn’t left.

Worse—two more pests had joined him.

Maxwell Thornton and Vanessa Sterling.

Since returning to the country, Vanessa had relied entirely on Harrison’s support. Now, with her reputation in ruins, she had nowhere else to go.

But the Harrison of today was a man awakened—brutally shoving Vanessa away before slapping her hard across the face.

"This is all your fault!" he snarled. "You ruined my family, my career! If you hadn’t come back, Natalie and I would still be together! How dare you show your face here? I should strangle you!"

The slap seemed to shatter Vanessa. After a stunned second, she lunged at him, nails bared.

"You think blaming me absolves you?" she shrieked. "You’re the one who led me on! You gave me hope, then let me attack Natalie! You allowed it all! And now you want to play the victim? You’re a spineless, cheating bastard! Natalie was a fool to ever love you!"

The delicate flower he’d once cherished now cursed him viciously. Harrison lost all control. They brawled openly, while Lawrence and Beatrice watched coldly. Maxwell scrambled to separate them.

The Blackwoods wisely stepped back, avoiding the chaos.

Ah. The betrayal turns violent.

Evelyn noted a passerby already filming the scene. Trending topic incoming.

She turned—only to find Sophia, Genevieve, and Margaret all recording avidly on their phones.

###Chapter 82

Evelyn couldn't help but smirk. Since when did the distinguished Blackwood women become such avid spectators of drama?

The Blackwood ladies shot her exasperated looks but didn’t stop recording the chaos unfolding before them. This newfound love for gossip? Entirely Evelyn’s influence.

Besides, they each had their own exclusive group chats now, buzzing with the latest scandals.

When Julian and Evelyn had stirred up that explosive scene on the reality show, even high society couldn’t resist diving into the juicy details.

In the end, fearing things might escalate beyond control, Marcus swiftly intervened with security.

Harrison and Vanessa had gone at each other with no restraint, drawing blood. Even as they were dragged apart, their venomous curses echoed through the room.

Who would’ve guessed that just weeks ago, they’d been flaunting their love on national television?

Vanessa was escorted out. Maxwell tried reasoning with Harrison, only to be met with a brutal punch that left him missing teeth.

"This is your fault too! You’re the reason I messed up! You were supposed to be my most trusted ally—how could you betray me like this?"

Maxwell’s patience snapped. He’d believed Harrison could still salvage his career, despite the online backlash. After all, the internet had a short memory.

But his own reputation was now in tatters, his past misdeeds exposed. His only hope had been Harrison’s comeback—and now, the man had turned on him.

"Betray you? I’ve always had your best interests at heart! When Natalie was useful, I backed her. Now Vanessa’s the better option, so I supported her. How was I supposed to know you’d screw things up with Natalie?"

Harrison’s parents, Lawrence and Beatrice, finally spoke up. "We kept you as his manager because we believed you cared for him. But this? Natalie is his wife! If he was wrong, you should’ve guided him, not enabled him!"

"I did this because I care! He’s been pining for Vanessa, trapped in a marriage he never wanted. Love isn’t about right or wrong—it’s about who he truly wants!" Maxwell retorted, self-righteous to the core.

"But I love Natalie!" Harrison shouted, his voice breaking.

"You’re just in denial because you failed," Maxwell scoffed.

Harrison crumpled, sobbing uncontrollably, while Maxwell pressed on. "If our plan had worked, you and Vanessa could’ve been together openly, and your career would’ve soared. So no, I wasn’t wrong. And Natalie? There’s no love left—abandoning her isn’t wrong either."

Lawrence and Beatrice spat in disgust. "You’re fired!" They stormed out, dragging Harrison with them.

"Can he seriously not see how twisted his logic is?" the onlookers murmured.

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud.

Oh, this is rich. He thinks it’s fine to ditch Natalie because there’s ‘no love left’? Does he know his wife’s been sleeping with his assistant behind his back?

The Blackwoods gasped.

He’s always working, leaving her lonely. So naturally, she found comfort with his assistant—acting like a married couple whenever he’s away.

And now? She’s planning to drain his accounts and run off with said assistant. He was supposed to be gone all day, but thanks to getting fired, he’s heading home early. Wonder what he’ll walk in on.

But hey, since he believes in ‘true love above all,’ he should understand, right? Love doesn’t care about timing or morality, after all. Ha!

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Evelyn, you’re downright diabolical.

After such entertainment, their moods were lifted—until they stepped outside and ran into a problem.

Evelyn’s fame had skyrocketed, and her half-hearted disguise did nothing to stop fans from swarming her for autographs and selfies. She barely managed to duck into a nearby boutique.

Time to call in the professionals. She dialed Marcus.

"Weren’t you just an artist before?" Marcus deadpanned after hearing her predicament.

Evelyn had been an obscure model once, unrecognizable without makeup. Now? Not so much.

"I’ll send Lillian. Also, heads up—" Marcus filled her in on the latest development. "Team Young Again dropped out, so now it’s four teams. Your next match? A direct face-off with Team Alpha Duo."

"Current boyfriend and ex-boyfriend?!" Evelyn’s voice shot up.

The Blackwood women perked up instantly.

Unlike the nauseatingly fake Team Young Again, this pairing promised real awkwardness.

Sebastian Hart, the brooding medieval heartthrob, was known for his icy demeanor—both on and off-screen. He’d built his career on being untouchable, never engaging in publicity stunts or fake relationships.

Adrian Cross, the charming teen drama star, was infamous for his scandals. Born into privilege, he flaunted his current relationship (though never officially confirmed) with Seraphina Delacroix, a rising actress.

Fans assumed Team Alpha Duo was just two heartthrobs paired for ratings. Little did they know—Adrian’s girlfriend was Sebastian’s ex.

Evelyn remembered the tension during their promo shoot. Sebastian had ignored Adrian entirely, while Adrian, grinning, kept trying to get closer.

Then, during the group photo, Adrian slung an arm around Sebastian’s neck, pulling him into a faux-intimate pose.

The result? A viral clip that spawned a niche fandom shipping the "ice and fire" duo.

Sebastian, however, looked like he’d rather chew glass than tolerate Adrian. He’d shaken him off immediately, not sparing a single glance.

Adrian’s manager had stepped in with a sheepish apology.

Oh. My. God.

Adrian wanted Seraphina to guest-star in their upcoming face-off!

Is he trying to create a warzone?!

Seraphina, unsurprisingly, refused.

But then—Adrian arranged a private meeting with Sebastian, asking him to convince her!

The Blackwoods were floored. Is Adrian insane?!

Logically, Sebastian should despise Seraphina. She’d dumped him when his career stalled. They shouldn’t even be on speaking terms, let alone sharing a stage.

Yet…

Evelyn checked the gossip feed. Sebastian hadn’t responded.

But he was en route to Starlight Club—where Adrian had set up their meeting.

Actions speak louder than words, huh? Does he actually want her there?

The Blackwoods were baffled. What kind of twisted love triangle is this?!

Meanwhile, Isabelle Laurent—Sebastian’s fiercely protective manager—had noticed his disappearance and was frantically searching for him. If she found them, she’d shut this down immediately.

I need to see this in person, Evelyn thought, itching with curiosity. Starlight Club… maybe…

"Hello? Are you listening?" Marcus’s voice snapped her back.

"Got it. Gotta go!" She hung up and turned to the Blackwoods with a sweet smile. "I have something to—"

"Let’s go somewhere fun!" Margaret cut in.

Sophia caught on instantly. "Since we’re all together, why not make it a night out?"

Genevieve flushed with excitement. "Everyone’s coming—no exceptions!"

Evelyn sighed.

"I heard Starlight Club’s exclusive. Let’s have Lillian take us there later…"

The vote was unanimous.

Meanwhile, Marcus’s phone buzzed. His face paled.

"Evelyn’s taking your family to Starlight Club."

Julian, lounging on the couch, frowned. "What’s that?"

"A high-end entertainment spot industry insiders love. I’ve got connections there to keep tabs on my artists. You’ve never gone, but…" Marcus hesitated. "It’s known for its… companionship services."

Julian’s eyebrow twitched. "Companionship?"

"Gorgeous men. Eight-pack abs. The works."

Julian’s jaw clenched.

Then Marcus’s phone buzzed again. His eye twitched. "Uh… your family just requested ten guys. Covering all… styles."

Julian’s expression darkened.

He immediately texted the Blackwood men’s group chat:

Julian: EMERGENCY. @Nathan, cancel your meeting. @Richard, stop fishing. @Theodore—keep studying! MOVE!
###Chapter 83

Evelyn Sinclair and her entourage arrived at the exclusive lounge, securing a private room directly across from the trio they'd encountered earlier.

But reality quickly set in—barging into strangers' private space to gossip wasn’t exactly proper, was it?

Since they were already there, they might as well enjoy themselves.

When the manager handed over a sleek tablet and asked if they’d like to order some entertainment, Evelyn’s eyes lit up.

This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for!

The Blackwood sisters exchanged confused glances. "What’s happening?"

As they leaned in and saw the manager swiping through profiles of stunning male companions, their cheeks flushed with scandalized delight.

The Blackwoods were old money—refined, dignified, and never indulgent. For Sophia, Genevieve, and Margaret, this was their first time in such an establishment, and the novelty sent a thrill through them.

Yet, within half an hour, the four women—now pleasantly buzzed—had completely forgotten their original mission, lost in the sheer joy of their little rebellion.

Margaret belted out classic rock anthems with a chiseled Adonis at her side, snapping selfies and flooding her group chat with updates.

"Now I get why men love these outings. It’s not just networking—it’s an experience!"

Sophia, usually the picture of restraint, was engrossed in a drinking game flanked by two towering heartthrobs. Every time she lost, she took a sip of champagne. But when they lost? She pinched their biceps, cheeks, or noses with playful glee, barely suppressing her laughter.

She even posted a photo to her elite divorcee group with the caption: "Understanding men. Appreciating men. Becoming the man."

Genevieve, meanwhile, was sprawled across the velvet couch, her porcelain skin flushed a deep rose. She—

Genevieve alternated between covering her eyes and sneaking peeks, occasionally letting out a sharp squeal of delight.

Before her, three sculpted men clad only in low-slung trousers moved with liquid grace, their muscles flexing under the studio lights as they demonstrated anatomical perfection to the art students. One winked at a blushing attendee, eliciting another round of giggles from the group.

Giddy with excitement, Genevieve rapidly fired off ten photos in succession to her private chat with her closest girlfriends. "The talent here is unreal—gorgeous AND eloquent. Best. Night. Ever."

Meanwhile, in the open lounge area, four more entertainers—each sporting playful animal ears and faux tails—circled Evelyn like predators toying with their prey. Blindfolded, she stumbled after them in a tipsy game of tag, her laughter ringing through the room.

"Over here, darling!" one crooned, darting just out of reach.

"Miss Sinclair, catch me if you can~" another teased, his voice dripping with amusement.

Near the entrance, Lillian stood sentry, her sharp eyes scanning the hallway beyond. One of the performers, taking a breather, noticed her rigid posture and sauntered over. "Why so serious, beautiful? Come join the fun."

Lillian didn’t even blink. "Not interested in men."

Shrugging, the entertainer retreated. Lillian remained, ever vigilant—until a flicker of movement at the door caught her attention. "Evelyn," she called over the music, "Isabelle Laurent just arrived. She’s inside."

Too absorbed in her game, Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "I’ll handle her later." She lunged for the nearest entertainer, missing spectacularly.

Lillian sighed. "The chaos is reaching critical levels."

Just then, Margaret, having  an enthusiastic karaoke performance, showered the stage with bills, her cheeks flushed with exhilaration.

The three Blackwood men froze in the doorway, their expressions darkening as they took in the scene: strobe lights, half-dressed men, and their respective women in varying states of intoxication.

The music pulsed on, but the room’s energy shifted instantly. Even drunk, the others sensed the sudden tension, their laughter dying mid-breath. The entertainers stiffened under the weight of the Blackwoods’ glares.

Nathan moved first, his long strides eating up the distance between him and Evelyn just as she blindly grabbed for her target.

Her fingers closed around a firm forearm. "Got you!" she crowed, triumphant. "Now you drink!" Tugging off her blindfold, she blinked up at the figure before her—and froze.

The black dress shirt clung to Nathan’s torso like a second skin, the fabric straining over the defined planes of his abdomen with each breath. Evelyn’s gaze lingered, her alcohol-addled brain supplying one thought: God, that waistline.

A slow, dreamy smile spread across her face.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

If I weren’t already married—well, technically the wife in this arrangement—I’d climb him like a tree.

His voice was dangerously calm. "Thinking of climbing me, Evelyn?"

Instead of answering, she reached out, index finger poised to poke his stomach.

Nathan caught her wrist before contact, veins prominent along his forearm.

Evelyn pouted. "Spoilsport."

Then, with drunken audacity, she squeezed the muscle under her grip—and giggled. "So firm. Bet it rivals Nathan’s."

His eyebrow twitched.

Her gaze finally lifted to his face. The giggle died. Oh shit. It IS Nathan. Why’s he— Her stomach lurched. I’m gonna be sick.

Nathan’s smile was razor-thin. "My abs thrilled you, but my face makes you nauseous?"

Evelyn barely made it to the restroom.

By the time Nathan found her, she was slumped against the sink, wiping her mouth with a shaky hand. He wordlessly handed her a tissue, his earlier anger tempered by concern.

"Thanks," she mumbled, avoiding his eyes. Maybe he’ll go easy on me. He’s being weirdly gentle.

Nathan watched her, amused. "You think I won’t hold this over you?"

"Can we just… go home?" she ventured, hoping to escape further scrutiny.

It’s not like I did much. Just… touched his abs. Accidentally.

"Just the abs?" Nathan echoed, lips quirking.

Evelyn’s face flamed. But damn, they felt good.

His ears turned pink.

Solid 99/10.

"Why not 100?" he challenged.

She smirked. "Less fabric next time. For accuracy."

Nathan’s ears went scarlet. "You’re impossible."

Just then, rapid footsteps echoed down the hall, followed by a shrill voice: "Stop! Seraphina!"

Evelyn’s head snapped up. Seraphina Delacroix? Here?!

Before Nathan could react, Evelyn—moments ago a wilted mess—suddenly sprang to life, yanking him into a nearby stall with surprising strength.

The door clicked shut just as stiletto heels skidded to a halt outside.
###Chapter 84

The heavy thud of the partition door closing was swallowed by the pulsing bass of the club's music, leaving Nathan Blackwood frozen in place with an expression of pure astonishment.

In that instant, Evelyn Sinclair had him pressed flush against the door, her entire body leaning into his. One delicate hand covered his mouth while the other hovered near her lips in a silent shhh.

Nathan's dark lashes fluttered, his usually sharp gaze now wide and unguarded. The intimidating aura of a powerful CEO had completely vanished, replaced by something far more vulnerable. His star-bright eyes, usually so piercing, were now dazed, helplessly locked onto the woman before him.

For a brief, breathless moment, Nathan resembled a fallen angel—his beauty both innocent and devastating, radiating an irresistible magnetism.

But Evelyn barely had time to admire him before the real entertainment began.

Gossip had arrived.

And nothing—nothing—was more important than gossip.

Eager, she tilted her head to peer through the narrow gap in the door. In her excitement, she pressed even closer against Nathan, their bodies nearly melding together in the cramped space.

Nathan's breath hitched. The intoxicating blend of her perfume and the faint scent of champagne clung to her, flooding his senses. A flush crept up his neck, staining his usually composed features.

Evelyn was dressed in a sleek, fitted tracksuit that hugged every curve, the casual attire somehow making her even more alluring. The warmth of her body seeped through his shirt, making his skin prickle with awareness.

He suddenly realized his arm had somehow found its way around her waist.

When did that happen?

Tensing, he tried to pull away, but Evelyn—completely absorbed in her spying—didn’t even notice. His gaze inadvertently trailed down the elegant slope of her neck, over the delicate curve of her shoulder, and lower—

Nathan swallowed hard and forced his eyes away.

He was trapped.

And Evelyn? She was loving this.

Just then, the scene unfolded before them.

A stunning woman with raven-black hair and porcelain skin burst into the restroom, her traditional gown swishing around her ankles. Her white stilettos clicked against the tiles as she paced, her face a picture of distress.

Ah, Seraphina Delacroix.

Evelyn recognized her instantly—the second-tier actress known for her tragic, doe-eyed roles. No wonder the public adored her. Even when she dated Adrian Cross, his fans hadn’t turned on her.

Now, Seraphina’s eyes were red-rimmed, her expression lost. She looked seconds away from bursting into tears.

Then—

The restroom door creaked open again.

Seraphina startled like a frightened rabbit. "W-What are you doing here? This is the ladies' room!"

The newcomer advanced, and Seraphina stumbled back until her shoulders hit the wall.

Evelyn nearly groaned. Seriously? If you wanted to escape, just lock yourself in a stall!

But no—Seraphina stayed rooted, cornered by a tall, imposing figure.

The atmosphere was so thick with drama, Evelyn half-expected a camera crew to jump out.

Exes reuniting—always either tearful or painfully awkward.

Meanwhile, Nathan’s jaw tightened. Why the hell did Sebastian Hart even come if he wasn’t interested?

Adrian Cross was relentless, pushing for some kind of collaboration. Seraphina seemed torn, her lips trembling—until Isabelle Laurent, Sebastian’s manager, stormed in.

Before Isabelle could speak, Seraphina blurted out, "I don’t want to play the supporting role!"

Isabelle’s eyes flashed. "Absolutely not."

Sebastian, who had been silent until now, finally spoke. "I agree with Isabelle." His voice was ice. "She doesn’t deserve to stand beside me."

Oh. Damn.

That was the exact line Seraphina had used when she dumped him.

The actress paled, tears welling.

Adrian, unfazed, shrugged. "The studio loves the idea. An unofficial couple? The buzz alone would skyrocket your careers."

But Isabelle stood firm. The risks—their past relationship being exposed, Sebastian’s unpredictable temper—were too great.

Nathan exhaled. At least someone here has sense.

Evelyn, however, was practically vibrating with excitement.

This was gold.

And they had front-row seats.
###Chapter 85

Seraphina Delacroix had no clue about Adrian Cross’s plan to propose. The shock left her utterly speechless. Isabelle Laurent remained composed, questioning whether he was serious. "What if you lose?" she asked pointedly.

To everyone’s surprise, Adrian responded with chilling calm. "If I lose, I’ll walk away. But if I win, I’ll propose—and amplify the publicity. It’s the perfect setup for my rebranding." He even added, with a smirk, "Besides, I genuinely want to marry Seraphina."

Nathan Blackwood arched a brow. How convenient. In the cutthroat world of entertainment, strategic marriages for clout weren’t unheard of. But back then, fame was built on trending stars—marriage, regardless of gender, meant a steep decline in popularity and opportunities. Unless, of course, Adrian had already decided to ditch chasing trends and pivot to serious acting.

Hilarious. Nathan nearly scoffed aloud. Adrian’s audacity was staggering—asking for his girlfriend’s ex’s blessing on live television? The expressions on Sebastian Hart and Seraphina’s faces must’ve been priceless.

But Sebastian lost all decorum, lashing out at Seraphina. "You’re nothing but a gold-digger," he sneered. "How many rich men have you played before settling for this fool?" His voice dripped with venom. "Does he even realize he’s signing up to be a cuckold?"

Lucky he didn’t get punched.

Nathan’s mind flashed to the intel he’d gathered. Rumor had it Sebastian once worked himself to exhaustion, landing in the hospital, just to support Seraphina—only for her to leave him for a silver-spoon heir. The betrayal had clearly festered into bitterness.

Yet Adrian didn’t react. Instead, he smiled, as if Seraphina’s virtue was unquestionable. "She’s amazing," he said simply, fueling Sebastian’s fury.

Sebastian’s terms were brutal: Kneel. Apologize. Drink an entire bottle of wine. Then—and only then—would he consider collaborating.

Since when did he think he was some tyrannical CEO? Nathan mused, unimpressed.

Humiliated, Seraphina fled.

Isabelle scolded Sebastian, but he brushed her off, claiming the room was suffocating. When she tried to stop him, she twisted her ankle—prompting Adrian to stay behind and help.

"Go after him," Isabelle urged, but Adrian ignored her. Odd, Nathan thought. What’s his game?

Evelyn Sinclair was equally puzzled—until a commotion erupted outside.

Sebastian’s voice was rough, barely restrained. "Running again? Can’t face me?"

Seraphina pressed a delicate hand against his chest, but the strength difference was laughable. Sebastian seized her wrists, pinning them above her head. She struggled, but it was futile—like a fragile doll in his grip. Tears welled in her eyes as she looked up helplessly.

Cliché? Absolutely. But witnessing it in person? Evelyn’s stomach twisted with secondhand embarrassment—and an unsettling thrill.

Nathan’s hand suddenly covered her eyes. "Don’t look," he muttered.

Not that she wanted to. But someone seemed to have forgotten two critical facts: Seraphina had a boyfriend, and Sebastian had just vowed to marry her manager. Call it rekindled passion—or call it a train wreck.

Sebastian’s grip tightened. "Who are you trying to seduce with those tears? Think I’d fall for it again?"

"I—I didn’t!" Seraphina’s voice trembled. "Let me go! I’m Adrian’s girlfriend now—"

Her plea dissolved into a gasp as Sebastian crushed his lips to hers.

Evelyn’s jaw dropped. Is this consensual? She hesitated—until Seraphina’s weak punches slowed… then stopped. Her arms slid around Sebastian’s neck instead.

Oh.

Nathan’s palm stayed firmly over Evelyn’s eyes. "Told you not to watch."

But the damage was done. The pie chart of Evelyn’s emotions had officially shattered.

And somewhere, Adrian Cross was definitely regretting his life choices.

###Chapter 86
Evelyn couldn't suppress her curiosity. She dug deeper into the rumors swirling around Sebastian and Isabelle.

Just then, another sound echoed from the doorway.

Sebastian and Seraphina sprang apart like they'd been electrocuted. Seraphina hastily wiped her lips, while Sebastian paled, as if he couldn’t believe what he’d just done.

"What are you two doing here? Sebastian, this is the ladies' restroom!"

The unmistakable voice of displeasure belonged to Isabelle, who had limped over. Dressed in a sharp business suit, her sleek bob framing her porcelain skin and pale lips, she exuded the aura of a powerful, striking woman. But as her gaze landed on the pair, her expression darkened into something unreadable.

Sebastian remained silent, his face stormy, as if explanations were beneath him.

"Oh my, what’s going on here?" Adrian’s surprised voice cut through the tension as he entered. Tall, golden-haired, and radiating charm, he looked every bit the college heartthrob—slightly broader than Sebastian, with a smile that could melt hearts.

Adrian’s voice softened with concern. "Seraphina, why are you crying?"

Now the stage was set. Evelyn watched with rapt attention.

Nathan thought, Are we seriously holding a meeting in a restroom?

"I—It’s nothing, just a misunderstanding," Seraphina stammered. "I tripped, and Mr. Hart heard the noise and came to help." She cast a furtive glance at Sebastian.

Meanwhile, Sebastian’s gaze burned as Adrian tenderly pulled Seraphina into his arms. He murmured reassurances before pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead.

Sebastian’s eyes darkened with something lethal—until Isabelle tugged sharply on his sleeve, snapping him back to reality.

Wow. Spectacular.

"Let’s take this somewhere else," Isabelle said, pinching the bridge of her nose.

"Right, we should discuss the performance proposal," Adrian agreed, guiding Seraphina toward the exit.

Sebastian’s voice dripped ice. "Shouldn’t you ask Ms. Delacroix first? She doesn’t seem thrilled."

Seraphina flinched.

Isabelle frowned, studying Sebastian. Did he already know how Seraphina would react?

Of course he did. They’d just kissed.

Adrian cupped Seraphina’s face. "Being the supporting actress is still an opportunity. And didn’t you say you’d marry me? I could propose on national television. Unless… you’ve changed your mind?" His tone was sweet, but his grip tightened.

Sebastian’s stare turned predatory, locked onto Seraphina.

She hung her head, radiating wounded innocence, lips trembling as if forcing back tears.

Adrian’s smile faltered. "Well, if you’re not—"

"I’ll do it." The words tumbled out, flat and resigned. Only then did she lift her gaze—directly at Sebastian, eyes brimming with accusation.

Then, without warning, Sebastian turned to Isabelle with startling tenderness.

Isabelle recoiled, but he caught her waist, pulling her flush against him.

"I’ve been planning to propose to Isabelle soon," he announced, voice dripping with devotion. "What better stage than one watched by millions?"

Isabelle’s face went rigid. She opened her mouth—then clenched her jaw.

She’s definitely cursing him out internally.

Nathan raised a brow. Wait, doesn’t Isabelle hate Sebastian?

Adrian’s smirk slipped. "So that’s why you two keep things so private. Always someone waiting in the shadows, huh?" He released Seraphina like she’d burned him.

Isabelle finally found her voice. "We haven’t actually discussed this. Maybe we should—"

Adrian cut her off, dragging Seraphina away to "give them space."

The door hadn’t even clicked shut before Isabelle shoved Sebastian back. "Have you lost your damn mind? What was that?"

A slow smirk curled his lips—

And Evelyn knew: the game was far from over.
###Chapter 87

"What do you mean, you don’t believe in my feelings?" Sebastian’s expression darkened as if he had been insulted. "I don’t propose twice. If you reject me now, the offer is gone forever."

Isabelle stared at him, utterly speechless.

Meanwhile, Nathan noticed Evelyn trembling violently against him, her body shaking with suppressed laughter. Her face had flushed crimson, and tears brimmed at the corners of her eyes.

Nathan arched a brow. What on earth was so amusing?

Unfortunately, Evelyn was too lost in her silent hysterics to share her thoughts.

A sharp inhale from Isabelle cut through the tension.

"This is a critical moment for your career! Stirring up a scandal now would cost you half your fanbase!"

Sebastian’s expression softened slightly at her concern. He knew how devoted Isabelle was—clearly, her hesitation stemmed from prioritizing his success. The realization warmed his resolve. If Seraphina could marry Adrian, why shouldn’t he marry Isabelle? She’d sacrificed far more for him than Seraphina ever had.

A man should marry the woman who truly cared for him, not some heartless—

Nathan’s grip tightened as Evelyn’s shaking intensified, rattling the door behind them. At this rate, she might actually suffocate.

"Stop worrying," Sebastian scoffed. "Do you think I rely on fangirls to stay relevant? My work speaks for itself. Stop underestimating me."

Isabelle’s face flickered with irritation before she schooled her features. "Sebastian, we’ve worked too hard to throw it away now. Give me one good reason to risk everything."

"Adrian’s using his relationship as leverage. Why can’t I?" he shot back.

"It’s different for him! Even if his plan backfires, he has connections and investors to fall back on. We don’t have that safety net. Our fans are our security. That’s the trade-off for being an idol actor."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched at the unfavorable comparison to Adrian, but he couldn’t deny her logic.

"Fine," he gritted out. "No public proposal. But I will crush Adrian."

Relief washed over Isabelle. "Then follow my strategy."

As she turned to leave, her ankle twisted. Before she could react, Sebastian swept her into his arms bridal-style.

"Have you lost your mind? Put me down!" she hissed.

"You’re hurt. I’m carrying you."

"If anyone sees us—"

The door slammed shut, ending the chaotic bathroom confrontation.

The Blackwood family’s SUV hummed with energy as Evelyn recounted the scene—omitting, of course, her psychic eavesdropping.

Julian scowled. "No wonder I saw that earlier."

Everyone leaned in. "Saw what?"

His nose wrinkled. "Adrian had Seraphina pinned against a wall, kissing her like the world was ending."

A collective shudder ran through the car. Considering Evelyn’s account of Sebastian and Seraphina’s bathroom tryst… did Adrian realize he was basically French-kissing Sebastian by proxy?

Julian added, "Then Sebastian walked past carrying Isabelle."

Margaret sighed. "No shame. Kisses his ex, then proposes to another woman?"

"Pathetic," Richard muttered. "Using a woman’s devotion as a weapon."

Genevieve bit her lip. "Isabelle’s too good for this. She treated us assistants kindly during shoots. Should we warn her? Imagine dedicating years to someone, only to become his revenge pawn."

Sophia’s disgust was palpable. "Men like him never change. He’ll probably keep chasing Seraphina even after marriage, dragging Isabelle into his mess."

The group turned to Evelyn, who sat stiffly, face twitching.

Then—uncontrollable giggles erupted.

Hilarious! Everyone assumes Isabelle’s in love, just like Sebastian!

The Blackwoods froze. "Wait… she’s not?"

Nathan had already pieced it together.

Is it love? Or a manager molding her star like clay? If gender’s irrelevant, then Marcus must be head-over-heels for Julian, right?

Julian choked on his water.

The analogy struck like lightning. Of course—Isabelle’s dedication was professional, not romantic.

"Cough—Isabelle’s just doing her job," Julian managed.

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled. Smart boy. If Sebastian had half your brains, I wouldn’t be dying of laughter tonight.

He thinks Isabelle’s sacrifices equal undying love. Typical narcissist—can’t fathom a woman building her empire while he’s just another project. Honestly, she’s not raising a lover; she’s dealing with a spoiled brat throwing a tantrum!

###Chapter 88 

The term "rebellious child" slipped out before anyone could stop it.

The driver felt the slightest tremor beneath his hands—was the car malfunctioning? For a brief, heart-stopping moment, he wondered if they were about to break down in the middle of the road.

Little did he know, the real cause was the passengers in the backseat struggling to contain their laughter, biting their lips so hard they nearly drew blood.

Did he seriously think everyone was as lovestruck as he was? The audacity to assume his half-baked marriage proposal was some grand favor, something Isabelle Laurent had been pining for all along. No wonder he looked like a kicked puppy when she turned him down.

The Blackwood family collectively thought, Good lord, keep it together—this man is delusional beyond belief!

The problem? She had stopped responding entirely, yet he remained blissfully unaware. In his mind, Isabelle’s love was just too humble, too devoted to his career, too afraid to accept the honor of spending her life with him.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Too humble? Oh, please.

The funniest part? He genuinely believed this was a done deal. Convinced he shouldn’t let Seraphina Delacroix manipulate him anymore, he’d decided to "settle" for Isabelle—the one who supposedly adored him unconditionally. Never mind that he hadn’t even asked her properly. In his mind, she was already his fiancée.

"Does Isabelle even know she’s been drafted into this circus?"

The Blackwoods were dying. Stop, stop—we can’t breathe!

No one dared laugh out loud, but their shoulders shook violently. To cover it up, they quickly jumped into the conversation, feigning concern over Julian’s delusional claims.

"What if Isabelle actually believes him?" Genevieve murmured, brows furrowed. "It’s a heartfelt confession from someone she’s known for years. She might get hurt."

Sophia snorted. "Please. She’s a professional. She’ll sniff out the BS before he finishes his first sentence."

I can only blame Isabelle for not having supernatural foresight—otherwise, she would’ve slapped the lunatic ages ago.

After witnessing Sebastian endure ruthless betrayal and abandonment, suffering through unimaginable pain, obsessively seeking revenge on Seraphina for years, never once reaching out in five years, and constantly spewing hatred—Isabelle, immune to love’s illusions, would’ve never guessed he was a masochist at heart.

Her feelings for him ran deep, which was precisely why she couldn’t trust the sincerity of his sudden confession.

The moment the words left his lips, everyone around them tensed, worried Isabelle might soften and fall into his trap.

But the truth? She didn’t care. All Isabelle wanted was for Sebastian to work diligently without causing trouble.

If he did love her? Lucky her. At least it was manageable—far better than him clinging to Seraphina, sabotaging his own future and forcing her to clean up the mess.

Right now was critical. She wished she could crack a whip and force him to focus on their upcoming performance. Love? Marriage? All of it could wait until after they secured their future. No distractions. No drama.

Just then, Nathan spoke up. "Isabelle is too ambitious to entertain romantic distractions. This period is crucial."

"Because of the transition?" Julian asked.

Nathan shot him an exasperated look. "Do you even follow industry news? Isabelle is gambling everything to break free from her agency and build her own. She can’t afford setbacks right now."

Finally, it clicked—why Isabelle hadn’t shut Sebastian down immediately. She was delaying, afraid any emotional upheaval would derail him at the worst possible moment.

A collective sigh of relief swept through the room—followed by stifled laughter.

Logically, Sebastian had to know what Isabelle was doing. Yet here he was, mooning over romance while she single-handedly fought for his career.

"Isabelle’s brilliant, but her taste in men? Questionable," Evelyn muttered.

Julian shrugged. "Professionally, Sebastian’s a solid investment. But emotionally? Hopeless."

And then there was that night—when Sebastian, after seeing Adrian and Seraphina together, showed up at Isabelle’s doorstep.

She made him coffee.

They spent the entire night discussing scripts.

By morning, dark circles shadowed Sebastian’s eyes. When teased about his lack of sleep, he smirked. "I was at Isabelle’s."

Half of it was petty revenge—letting Adrian and Seraphina think something happened. The other half? Convincing Isabelle his feelings were real.

(Even the Gossip System couldn’t decipher which motive dominated. The human heart is unpredictable.)

But his stunt tainted their once-professional dynamic. Now, their manager had to intervene.

Today, Isabelle’s patience had officially reached its limit.

And yet—she held back. Impressive.

Evelyn abruptly straightened. "Marcus, I need a break."

Before Marcus could protest, Julian and Genevieve were already strolling off, hands in pockets, eager to witness the chaos.

Marcus rubbed his temples. Rebels, all of them.

Fine. He’d watch too.

The rehearsal room had a high rectangular window—originally for filming angles—but now, it served as the perfect vantage point.

Inside, tension crackled.

Sebastian and Seraphina stood to the side—him brooding, her eyes red-rimmed and lost.

Isabelle’s face was stone-cold fury. Adrian stood beside her, expression unreadable.

Earlier intel suggested Sebastian and Seraphina had been rehearsing. Isabelle and Adrian, delayed by meetings, had arrived just in time to witness—

Evelyn gasped.

Oh. They weren’t rehearsing.

Julian and Genevieve inhaled sharply. The audacity.

Marcus, oblivious to their mental commentary, frowned at their horrified expressions.

Why did he suddenly feel excluded?

###Chapter 89

When Sebastian arrived, he found himself alone with Seraphina. The moment Seraphina’s eyes landed on him, her breath hitched, and she immediately looked away, her fingers tightening around the script in her hands. She took a step back, clearly uncomfortable sharing the same space with him.

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. Before she could slip past him, he caught her wrist, his voice icy. "Running away again? I thought you were here to rehearse."

Seraphina’s lashes fluttered as she avoided his gaze. "This—this isn’t appropriate. I have a boyfriend, and you… you have a fiancée." Her voice trembled, and though she tried to steel herself, the redness rimming her eyes betrayed her.

She was holding back tears.

A sharp pang twisted in Sebastian’s chest, making it hard to breathe.

"You’re right," he bit out, tightening his grip. "I do have a fiancée. A woman I love deeply, who’s stood by me for years. Loyal. Devoted. After this show, we’re getting married. So don’t flatter yourself—nothing could ever happen between us."

Seraphina flinched as if struck, her lips parting soundlessly.

"The only reason you got this supporting role is because I demanded you as my co-star. You’re here to elevate my performance, not the other way around. Or is it too much for you? Can’t stand the thought of helping the man you abandoned all those years ago?"

Tears spilled down Seraphina’s cheeks.

Sebastian’s gaze darkened, but he ignored her silent weeping. "Stay," he ordered. "We’re rehearsing."

He dragged her back, forcing her into position.

Evelyn watched from the sidelines, sipping her coffee with an amused smirk.

Smooth, Sebastian. Real smooth. Out of all the scenes, you just happened to pick the one with a confession and a kiss? And she has to initiate it? Please. You’re not fooling anyone.

Julian and Genevieve exchanged knowing glances. "Ah," Julian murmured, "so the real goal isn’t the performance, is it?"

Genevieve smirked. "Next time, just admit you wanted an excuse to kiss her. No need for this whole ‘professional rehearsal’ charade."

Julian shook his head. "Pathetic. Absolutely shameless."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. This was straight out of one of those ridiculous dramas where the male lead, drowning in denial, would maul the heroine while insisting it was hate, not love. Meanwhile, the actual fiancée and boyfriend were left standing there like background props.

Inside, Isabelle was seething.

Even for live performances, stand-ins handled intimate scenes. No professional production rehearsed like this.

"Rehearsal?" Isabelle’s voice cut through the tension, sharp as a blade. "Sebastian, do you even know where we are?"

The room buzzed with chatter, a public space filled with crew and cast. But Sebastian, lost in his own little world, hadn’t spared a single thought for the consequences.

Predictably, he scowled. "I said it was a rehearsal. Drop it."

Isabelle’s laugh was brittle. "And when the media gets hold of this? The headlines will scream, ‘Sebastian Hart Caught Kissing Another Man’s Girlfriend Under the Guise of Acting.’"

Sebastian’s face flushed with anger. "Enough! Stop being so damn jealous. You’re making a scene."

Isabelle froze. The onlookers gaped.

Jealous? Evelyn nearly choked. Oh, this is rich. The man’s delusional.

Isabelle’s fingers curled into fists. "Jealous?" she repeated, voice dangerously low. "Say that again, Sebastian. I dare you."

The air crackled with tension.

Isabelle had planned everything meticulously—choosing a patriotic theme to rebuild Sebastian’s image, casting Adrian as the villain, Seraphina as the victim. No romance. No unnecessary drama.

And yet here they were.

"Adding a scene?" Julian murmured, brows raised.

Genevieve snorted. "This kind of scene?"

Marcus crossed his arms. "More like making up excuses."

Evelyn clicked her tongue. Not added. The whole script’s been rewritten.

Julian and Genevieve exchanged startled glances. How had Isabelle not noticed?

Isabelle’s expression darkened as realization dawned. The script in Sebastian’s hands wasn’t the one she’d approved.

She was this close to exploding.

"You changed the narrative," she hissed. "You decided to scrap my script?"

Sebastian finally had the decency to look guilty. He avoided her gaze. "It’s better this way."

Isabelle laughed, the sound sharp and humorless. "Behind my back, you threw out the script I handpicked for your career and replaced it with some cheap love triangle? So much for your ‘image change.’"

The room held its breath.

Sebastian had crossed a line—and Isabelle wasn’t letting it slide.
###Chapter 90

Sebastian felt his cheeks burn under Isabelle's piercing gaze. "I just thought... leveraging my strengths would draw initial attention," he stammered, avoiding Seraphina's curious glance. "For the competition—"

"Is Sebastian Hart actually calling me a fool?" Isabelle's voice was sharp enough to slice through steel. "Every single one of your fans tuned in to watch you reinvent yourself. Did you really think cheap tactics would impress them?" She crossed her arms, her manicured nails tapping impatiently. "They want growth, not the same old tricks!"

Sebastian's face drained of color, then flooded with humiliation. "But love scenes sell on this stage. Our script fits the theme. Just this once—"

Isabelle didn’t need further confirmation. The way Sebastian kept sneaking glances at Seraphina told her everything. This wasn’t strategy—it was a pathetic, personal ploy.

"Every second on that screen is a gift," she hissed. "Are you really going to throw away your comeback—and your fans’ faith—for a schoolboy crush?" Her glare hardened. "Fix it. Now."

Sebastian clenched his jaw. Being scolded like a misbehaving child in front of Seraphina was unbearable.

Rebroadcast Revelations

The studio lights blazed as the revised footage aired, sparking instant chaos online. Fans gasped at the abrupt change—Sebastian’s forced romantic angle had vanished, replaced by raw, unfiltered intensity.

Isabelle watched the live reactions roll in, her lips pressed into a thin line. This wasn’t just about saving Sebastian’s career anymore. It was about salvaging his dignity.

And Seraphina? She stood silently in the wings, her smirk barely concealed. Some games, it seemed, were too transparent even for reality TV.
###Chapter 91

Evelyn Sinclair, on the other hand, didn’t let Seraphina Delacroix’s intrusion ruin her mood. By the time she settled into the private room, she had effortlessly taken control of the harmonious atmosphere.

As for Nathan Blackwood and the others, they were treated to quite the spectacle the moment they arrived.

When Adrian Cross went to fetch Seraphina, only two seats remained in the private room—conveniently placed between Adrian’s manager and Sebastian Hart.

Though there was ample space between the chairs, logic dictated Seraphina should have sat beside Adrian’s manager to avoid any awkwardness, leaving Adrian to take the seat next to Sebastian.

But when Adrian escorted Seraphina in, something unexpected happened. As they moved toward the empty spots, Seraphina hesitated briefly as she passed Sebastian’s side.

Sebastian was engrossed in his phone, his expression unreadable, though his brows were slightly furrowed. The next moment, as Seraphina attempted to walk past, she "accidentally" tripped over a chair leg and tumbled into the seat beside him.

Flustered, Seraphina scrambled to stand, her movements chaotic. It was Adrian who stopped her. "Just sit here. Are you hurt?"

"I’m fine," Seraphina murmured softly, casting a timid glance at Sebastian, her discomfort palpable.

Sebastian remained indifferent throughout, while Isabelle Laurent struggled to maintain her composure.

Adrian’s manager, clearly privy to some inside information, shot Seraphina a disapproving glare.

Across from them, Evelyn, Julian, and Marcus Donovan nearly lost it.

How entertaining! Absolutely brilliant. Juggling an ex and a current lover—now that’s a real tug-of-war. A love triangle truly is the most stable shape.

Julian frowned. What kind of bizarre triangle is Evelyn imagining now?

Even Marcus, who usually preferred networking over drama, found himself thoroughly entertained. After all, these troublemakers weren’t his problem—which made the whole situation even more amusing.

Getting down to business, Isabelle raised her glass, her smile dazzling. "For the next round, I hope you’ll all go easy on us."

Everyone lifted their glasses, and Marcus forced a polite smile. "If anything, we should be the ones asking for mercy."

Adrian’s manager chuckled. "Marcus, you’re being too modest. We just hope we don’t end up like the last group."

"That was an anomaly," Marcus replied smoothly. "Truthfully, we’ve got our own challenges—especially with a complete rookie in acting. She’s as green as they come, so we’ll need everyone’s guidance moving forward." He nudged Evelyn, who was currently devouring a lamb chop.

Only then did Evelyn raise her glass in acknowledgment, though no one took offense. After all, everyone knew she had the backing of Blackwood Group.

Julian, seated beside her, handed her a napkin when he noticed sauce on her chin. His habitual care spoke volumes about her place in his heart.

Isabelle smiled warmly. "Marcus has an eye for talent. To nurture such a promising newcomer so quickly—impressive."

She turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair, not only are you a woman of integrity, but your acting potential is undeniable. It’s a shame you entered the industry so late—you could’ve been a sensation years ago. But even now, you’ve skyrocketed to fame with just one hit. You’re easily the fastest-rising star among newcomers this season."

Whether Isabelle meant every word or not, her praise sounded genuine.

Evelyn smiled back. "Thank you, Isabelle."

Isabelle exhaled in relief. She’d worried Evelyn might be difficult, but the woman was surprisingly easygoing.

At the table, the managers chatted animatedly. Adrian managed to exchange a few words with Julian. Seraphina attempted small talk with Evelyn. Sebastian, however, remained silent—almost as if he were allergic to socializing.

Even Julian was outperforming him, which struck him as odd.

Ah, I see, Evelyn mused. For years, Isabelle has handled all the socializing. Under her guidance, Sebastian could focus solely on acting and fans without lifting a finger. No wonder he’s so awkward now.

Her thoughts took a sharp turn. It’s like a hardworking mother raising an ungrateful, rebellious son.

Then again… This isn’t even a formal event. Just a casual dinner. Could his awkwardness really be because of Seraphina? Is he deliberately acting out?

Her internal monologue was interrupted when Sebastian suddenly reached for a dish—the same one Seraphina had been eyeing.

Seraphina’s chopsticks froze mid-air.

Sebastian didn’t even glance at her as he took a portion and placed it on his plate.

Evelyn nearly choked. Oh? What’s this? A silent power struggle?

Seraphina hesitated before murmuring, "I… I wasn’t going to take that."

Sebastian finally looked at her, his expression unreadable. "I know."

Then why did you take it?! Evelyn screamed internally.

Sebastian’s response was flat. "You weren’t eating it, but you still wanted to claim it? Wasting food is shameful."

Evelyn blinked. Was that… an explanation? Or just an excuse to be petty?

Seraphina flushed, casting Sebastian a timid glance before whispering, "Thank you."

But the drama wasn’t over.

Evelyn, ever the gossip enthusiast, had sharp eyes.

Wait a minute… His left hand is under the table. Her right hand is under the table. And they’ve been like that for a while now? My radar is buzzing.

Julian frowned when he noticed Evelyn’s sudden tension.

Evelyn, seizing the moment, "accidentally" dropped her fork and bent to retrieve it.

Neither Sebastian nor Seraphina noticed—both too absorbed in whatever was happening beneath the tablecloth.

The next second, Evelyn resurfaced, trembling with suppressed excitement.

Hah! I knew it! Under the table, he’s holding her hand—no, not just holding. They’re interlocked. And she’s barely resisting! This isn’t just a casual touch. This is a full-on romantic drama moment!

Julian, catching her expression, nearly groaned. What fresh chaos has she uncovered now?

Evelyn’s thoughts raced. If I yanked the tablecloth off right now, exposing them to the entire room—oh, the scandal! The drama!

But before she could act, Julian subtly shook his head. Don’t.

Evelyn pouted. Fine. But this is gold.

Sebastian and Seraphina remained oblivious, lost in their own little world.

Evelyn smirked. Over the top? Absolutely. But oh, so entertaining.
###Chapter 92

Julian rose abruptly, raising his glass toward Seraphina and the others. "A toast to the three of you. May our upcoming showdown be thrilling."

Without waiting for a response, he downed his wine in one swift motion.

The others had no choice but to reciprocate quickly—anything less would have been disrespectful.

Adrian was the first to stand, glass in hand.

But the two beside him remained oblivious, tangled in their own world. When they finally realized what was happening, they scrambled to their feet in a flurry of panic, their fingers still entwined.

The way they hastily pulled apart only made their guilt more obvious. Even without seeing it firsthand, the awkward angle of their arms and their flustered movements told the whole story. Across the table, Marcus Donovan’s lips twitched in amusement.

Hah! Julian, your timing is impeccable.

Julian’s smirk widened as he took in the chaos unfolding before him.

Even Adrian looked momentarily stunned—proof that even the oblivious fool hadn’t expected them to be this bold in his presence.

Julian flicked a glance at Adrian, catching a flicker of jealousy in his eyes. It was unclear who it was directed at, but it vanished just as quickly.

Poor Isabelle. No matter how hard she tries, she can’t stop this train wreck. Seeing this in front of outsiders must be frying her brain.

Julian sighed. Life is hard. Being a woman is harder. But being Sebastian Hart’s manager? That’s the hardest job of all.

Hah! Sebastian and Seraphina look like they’ve seen a ghost. Still enjoying the thrill of sneaking around? Regretting it now? Sebastian, listen to your mother—stop getting involved with unsuitable women. It’ll ruin your career!

Julian found the whole thing darkly amusing.

Marcus noticed the two beside him trembling with suppressed laughter. Not wanting to humiliate them further, he smoothly changed the subject. "Julian, you drank too fast. I didn’t even get a chance to clink glasses with you. Shouldn’t you be toasting Evelyn first?"

Julian’s shoulders shook slightly as he picked up his glass again. "My mistake."

Evelyn stood as well, raising her glass with a slightly strained smile. "Let’s... do it together..."

Eventually, Sebastian and Seraphina managed to compose themselves enough to stand and join the toast.

Not long after they sat back down, Isabelle could no longer hold back. She excused herself under the pretense of selecting a wine and dragged Sebastian outside.

Evelyn knew Isabelle was about to tear into Sebastian, and the thought of witnessing his downfall was delicious. But with no idea where they’d gone, she couldn’t follow. She’d just have to wait for the inevitable fallout.

Soon after, Evelyn stepped out to use the restroom. As she exited, she spotted Seraphina lurking in the hallway.

Oh, this is going to be good.

Following Seraphina’s footsteps, she reached the balcony at the end of the corridor, where Seraphina was hiding behind a large potted plant near the door.

Moments later, Sebastian and Isabelle’s voices carried through. Evelyn smirked and slipped into an empty private room to eavesdrop.

Isabelle: "Sebastian, I’m done wasting my breath. If you want to live in denial, fine. But if you keep blurring personal and professional lines, letting your emotions run wild, causing scandals, and jeopardizing your image—I’m done with you."

Sebastian: "What the hell are you talking about?"

Isabelle: "Plain English. Do I need to spell it out? What you two were doing downstairs—right in front of her boyfriend—was disgusting. I never knew your morals were this low!"

Sebastian: "She’s my—"

Isabelle: "Ex-girlfriend! Are you stupid? Would you dare post what you did online and see if anyone defends you?"

Sebastian: "Isabelle, enough! Whose side are you even on? It was just an accident!"

Isabelle: "Shut up!" Her voice was razor-sharp.

Sebastian scoffed. "What right do you have to judge me? You’re no better—mixing personal and professional matters yourself!"

Isabelle: "Excuse me?"

Sebastian: "We agreed to change the script. So why are you still interfering? Tweaking the storyline every other day—what’s your game?"

Isabelle: "Oh, so you don’t want to cut the scenes where you spend half your time groping Seraphina? How noble of you."

Sebastian: "It’s necessary for the plot! Without it, the love story loses its meaning!"

Pathetic. If Sebastian’s fans knew he was using his career to fuel his personal fantasies, they’d be devastated.

Isabelle: "You’re shameless."

Suddenly, Seraphina burst into tears. "I’m sorry, Isabelle! There’s nothing between Sebastian and me. You heard him—he despises me. He likes you. Please don’t fight because of me. I just want you both to be happy. If you hate me, I’ll quit the project."

Isabelle nearly laughed. "I’ve been scolding him this whole time—when did I say I hated you? Stop creating drama, Ms. Delacroix."

Ouch. Isabelle wasn’t holding back.

Seraphina froze, clearly not expecting the direct hit.

Sebastian immediately snapped, "Isabelle Laurent!"

Isabelle: "I can hear you. It’s you two who are deaf—only hearing what you want to hear, lost in your own delusions."

She took a breath before continuing. "I’ve had enough of this charade. Things can’t get any worse anyway."

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed. Is she finally going to—?

Isabelle: "Sebastian, where did you get the idea that I’m into you? Have I ever said I liked you? Or tried to sneak into your life? To me, you’re just another artist I manage. Nothing more. If you keep this up, I’m done with you."

Hah! I wish I could see his face right now.

Sebastian looked like he’d been struck.

Seraphina quickly jumped in. "Isabelle, this is all my fault. Don’t take my words to heart. You’ve stood by Sebastian for years—everyone knows how much you’ve sacrificed for him. You’re the one who truly deserves him!"

Sebastian seemed to regain his footing—until Isabelle cut in.

Isabelle: "I wasn’t talking to you, but since you’re so eager—have you played the tragic second lead so much that you need me to fill the role? Even if I’m not interested, you’re determined to cast me as the villain while you play the selfless martyr. Does that make you feel better?"

She leaned in. "Or is it that you can’t decide between Adrian and Sebastian? Adrian’s unstable, but Sebastian has potential—and he’s obsessed with you. Tough choice, isn’t it? So you’re keeping both on the hook?"

Damn. Isabelle wasn’t just good—she was brilliant.

Best. Verbal. Duel. Ever.

###Chapter 93

Evelyn's outburst left the two completely stunned.

Seraphina had completely forgotten about her pitiful facade, her expression twisting momentarily before she quickly regained her composure. With a trembling voice, she whimpered, "I know you never liked me before, but you—"

"Why did you become like this, Evelyn? I don’t even recognize you anymore," Sebastian said, his voice laced with shock.

"Maybe it’s because you’re blind," Evelyn scoffed. She pointed at Seraphina and began recounting past events to Sebastian.

"Have you forgotten? You were on the verge of stardom, with a golden opportunity to break into the film industry. I agreed to be your agent because I saw your potential—you could’ve been the lead in that award-winning film. But what did you do? You threw it all away for a fool like her, making your path to success ten times harder than it needed to be."

Sebastian’s expression darkened at her words.

A flicker of panic crossed Seraphina’s face.

From a distance, Evelyn’s thoughts raced as she pieced together the hidden details. Oh, I see now. That year, there was a critically acclaimed movie holding open auditions for fresh faces. Sebastian, with his striking looks and raw talent, was the top contender for the lead role. But just before the final audition, he vanished—all because of a frantic call from Seraphina, claiming there was a fire and she was trapped. Of course, he rushed to her rescue without hesitation. At the time, it seemed noble. But the truth? She never even called the fire department. Instead, she waited, playing the damsel in distress, while the actual fire was handled by the elderly couple upstairs who alerted the authorities. By the time Sebastian arrived, the firefighters were already there, scolding Seraphina for her recklessness. If she had just called for help immediately, the damage would’ve been minimal. But no—she had to make sure Sebastian missed his audition.

Julian, eavesdropping nearby, nearly choked on his drink. What the hell?

Evelyn’s thoughts continued, And here’s the real kicker—Seraphina was paid off. Half a million dollars to sabotage Sebastian’s chance. The one who paid her? None other than her current sugar-daddy boyfriend, Adrian. That’s how they met. Talk about a well-kept secret!

Julian’s eyebrows shot up. Damn.

Sebastian, oblivious to the bombshell, clenched his fists. "I haven’t forgotten what she did to me. I swear, Isabelle, I won’t have anything to do with her again."

But even as he spoke, his gaze flickered back to Seraphina, who swayed dramatically, her eyes brimming with tears. Against his better judgment, he reached out to steady her—only for her to pull away, her sorrowful gaze cutting deeper than any words.

Just then, a sharp voice cut through the tension.

"Sebastian, you’re heartless!"

A young woman stormed forward, wrapping a protective arm around Seraphina.

Evelyn smirked. Oh, this just got even messier.
###Chapter 94

Sebastian Hart didn’t expect someone to storm up to him and start berating him. Annoyed, he snapped back, "You're Seraphina’s assistant. What the hell are you even talking about?"

The young woman opened her mouth to speak, but Seraphina Delacroix, tears welling in her eyes, desperately stopped her. "Don’t tell him!"

Yet the assistant, clearly exasperated, blurted out without restraint, "Back then, Seraphina was threatened by Mr. Lynch. If she didn’t leave you, he would’ve blacklisted you—even had you hurt. Remember that accident on set? The struggle to land good roles? All of that was because Mr. Lynch wanted to steal Seraphina away. In the end, she chose to compromise. She couldn’t bear to see you risk everything for her, so she played the villain and left. And what did you do? Once you gained power, you saw her—abandoned by Lynch—and instead of coming back, you made her life hell at every turn. She suffered, but she never came crawling back, afraid you’d look down on her. And now, you let the woman beside you insult her? Sebastian, you’re heartless!"

Her words tumbled out in a chaotic rush, as if she were too furious to hold back.

Seraphina trembled with guilt. I finally figured out what she was doing with her phone earlier—contacting her assistant for this dramatic performance! Evelyn Sinclair thought, growing more amused by the second. Seraphina’s terrified of losing Sebastian, so she’s pulling out all the stops. After years of acting, she knows exactly how to twist the plot. This is better than a soap opera.

At that point, Julian Blackwood couldn’t resist any longer. He wanted to get up and enjoy the live drama.

Eventually, Adrian Cross grew impatient from waiting and stood, announcing he was going to the restroom.

The room emptied, leaving only two agents exchanging glances. Julian had no choice but to stay and keep listening to Evelyn’s running commentary.

Meanwhile, Evelyn heard movement nearby. Thankfully, I’m well-hidden. She spotted Adrian sneaking closer. Another spectator!

Sebastian, stunned, turned to Seraphina. "Is this true?"

Seraphina only cried harder, refusing to meet his eyes.

Sebastian might be a fool, but Isabelle Laurent wasn’t. "You’re seriously believing her just because she ranted all that?" Isabelle frowned. She couldn’t confirm the truth, but she knew Seraphina wasn’t the self-sacrificing type. "Where’s the proof?"

The assistant glared. "What proof could there be for something like this? Isabelle, you’re being malicious. If you hadn’t told Seraphina back then that you hoped they’d break up—that she was holding Sebastian back—she wouldn’t have made her decision."

Sebastian’s gaze darkened as he turned to Isabelle, as if seeing a scheming villain for the first time.

Isabelle’s heart ached. They’d been partners for years.

Still, she admitted, "I did say that."

Sebastian’s eyes reddened.

"But you’ve forgotten—I said it right to your face," Isabelle countered.

Ah, she said it in anger after that fire incident, Evelyn mused. As his agent, it was her job to keep him from dating a liability.

Sebastian’s suspicion lingered. "Was that the only time?"

He still thinks Isabelle has feelings for him, Evelyn realized. He assumes she’d want Seraphina gone.

Isabelle’s hope for their professional future withered. She sneered at him like he was a fool. "Yes. I dare to confront."

Seraphina buried her face in her assistant’s shoulder, sobbing. "It’s true. Sebastian, don’t blame Isabelle. She’s done so much for you. What happened… it was so long ago. I did it willingly, never expecting you to find out. We’ve missed our chance. Just let it go."

Wow. That explanation… impressive. If she keeps this up, I’m calling the cops, Evelyn thought.

The assistant chimed in, "That’s not fair. Because of her sacrifice, you finally focused on acting. Yet you credit Isabelle, thinking she stood by you. What about Seraphina’s pain? You hurt her over and over."

Without the Gossip System, even I’d be swayed—let alone hopeless romantic Sebastian, Evelyn mused.

Sure enough, tears streamed down Sebastian’s face. "Seraphina, tell me. Is it true? I need to hear it from you."

Seraphina shook her head. "It’s all lies! Stop asking!" She tried to leave, but Sebastian grabbed her arm.

Another tragic love story was unfolding.

Isabelle massaged her temples, exhausted. She didn’t care if her efforts were dismissed. She’d done it for her career, not his gratitude.

Now, not even a bet could stop Isabelle from wanting to break their contract, Evelyn thought.

Men aren’t easily deceived—they’re just arrogant, assuming women should sacrifice everything for them. Even an obvious act can trap them. Evelyn smirked. Ugh, they’re kissing again. Hard to watch… Wait, Adrian’s still here! He didn’t stop them. His intentions aren’t pure.

Seraphina’s trying to balance both men, not wanting Adrian to see her devotion to Sebastian, Evelyn deduced.

But Sebastian spoke up. "Adrian, there’s something I need to tell you—"

Seraphina cut him off. "Sebastian, we’ve said enough. I’ll help with the play. Just go home." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Please."

Sebastian’s heart ached as he searched her tear-filled eyes. Reluctantly, he left.

Now, only two remained on the balcony.

Before Seraphina could speak, Adrian kissed her.

Ah. You just want to taste what Sebastian had. You’re an obsessive fan! Evelyn grinned.

Seraphina, panicked, assumed Adrian had seen everything. "Adrian, I’m sorry! I didn’t want it—he forced me. I love you."

Adrian wiped his mouth. "I know. Don’t worry. I’ll step aside so you two can reconcile."

Seraphina froze. "What?"

She’s panicking. She wants to keep playing both sides, weighing who’s more useful. How dare you force her to choose! Evelyn laughed.

Adrian played the selfless martyr. "You love each other. I just want you happy."

Seraphina stiffened, but Adrian cut her off. "I’ll handle the online backlash. Don’t worry."

Hilarious. Only magic can defeat magic, Evelyn thought, grinning.



###Chapter 95

Seraphina Delacroix never intended to make a decision about Sebastian Hart so hastily. As long as Adrian Cross didn’t push her away, she could continue playing both sides. But now, seeing Adrian act so generously, she knew if this reached Sebastian, she’d be trapped in an impossible situation.

Her only choice was to retreat strategically—to feign vulnerability and avoid the topic entirely.

"Adrian, please don’t say that. Seeing you like this, I—" Seraphina’s voice cracked, her eyes welling up with tears as if she were torn apart by guilt.

Adrian’s gaze softened. "Seraphina, don’t cry. No matter what happens, I’ll always be here for you."

"Stop saying things like that."

"I mean it. Even if you choose Sebastian, I’ll never abandon you." His words carried a hidden weight, a promise laced with something darker.

For a moment, Seraphina almost believed she had completely ensnared him—that he was now her devoted, self-sacrificing pawn. I really am that good.

But something felt off. Was Adrian seriously suggesting that even after she reunited with Sebastian, he’d still linger in the shadows as her secret lover? Disgusting. Evelyn Sinclair wrinkled her nose in distaste.

Inside the private room, Julian Blackwood watched Isabelle Laurent and Sebastian return one after another, their icy silence filling the air. Meanwhile, he continued eavesdropping on Evelyn’s internal monologue.

Just as he was enjoying the drama, Evelyn’s thoughts took a sharp turn—Ugh, Adrian is truly deranged! He’s actually planning to play the long game, staying close to Seraphina as her hidden benefactor. Pathetic.

Julian suppressed a shudder, as if he’d accidentally witnessed a fanatic’s shrine to their obsession. Then, his gaze flickered to Sebastian, who was absorbed in his phone. Poor fool. He has no idea what’s coming.

The awkward gathering finally ended, and one by one, the guests departed.

Outside, Evelyn and Julian witnessed the lingering, meaningful glance exchanged between Sebastian and Seraphina before they each slipped into their respective cars. Moments later, their own ride arrived.

Nathan Blackwood was already inside, having come personally to pick them up.

As soon as Evelyn slid into the seat, Nathan asked, "So, what fresh chaos unfolded today?"

That was all the prompting Evelyn needed. Her eyes sparkled as she launched into a dramatic retelling, embellishing where necessary. Nathan listened intently, his expression shifting between amusement and disbelief.

The only downside? She couldn’t reveal the juiciest details—the ones she’d gleaned from her Gossip System.

Marcus Donovan smirked. "So, you weren’t actually sick. You were just hiding, gathering intel." And what explosive intel it was. Even as a seasoned agent, he was impressed by the sheer audacity of the schemes unfolding.

Evelyn grinned.

Marcus mused, "In that case, now might be the perfect time to poach Isabelle."

"Wait—Marcus, are you into Isabelle? Are you seriously planning to pursue her?" Evelyn gasped.

Marcus choked. "What? No! I’m talking about recruiting her to our agency so she can mentor you."

Evelyn’s mind immediately conjured up visions of a carefree artist life—Isabelle had spoiled Sebastian rotten, handling everything for him. If she became her agent, Evelyn could finally relax.

Nathan and Julian exchanged glances. Even the thought of saddling an ambitious agent like Isabelle with Evelyn’s laziness made them feel vaguely guilty.

Marcus, however, was already strategizing. Since the two men with the final say were present, he didn’t hesitate to pitch his idea.

Julian had no objections, but Nathan remained silent, deep in thought.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you concerned about something?" Marcus asked. "Do you think Isabelle’s too loyal to leave Sebastian?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not a chance."

Nathan finally spoke. "Isabelle is sharp and ambitious. She’s been excessively patient with Sebastian, but given the storm brewing around him, she won’t stay trapped for long. The only question is whether she can escape unscathed."

Julian added, "If we succeed in recruiting her, we can cover any financial losses from breaking her contract."

Nathan’s lips curved slightly. "Money isn’t the issue."

His dark eyes gleamed with calculation. "Earlier, you mentioned Adrian promised to reunite Sebastian and Seraphina without backlash. What do you think that means?"

Evelyn blinked. "Uh… I just memorized the lines."

Julian smirked. "Don’t overthink it. Just enjoy the show."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. Is he messing with me?

Meanwhile, Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe were sweating bullets—Team A-List had switched to a confidential script again.

The last time they’d done that, Team Young Again had imploded.

They prayed history wouldn’t repeat itself.

Backstage before the live broadcast, Evelyn finally had a moment to indulge in gossip.

Normally, Isabelle would’ve been hovering, desperate for insider details about the secret script. But now? She barely lifted a finger beyond the bare minimum.

She’s acting like an employee who’s already handed in her resignation—doing just enough to collect her paycheck. Yet beneath her cold exterior, she still cared—especially about Sebastian’s fans.

Then, the tension between Isabelle and Sebastian erupted into another argument.

The entire backstage area fell silent, ears straining to catch every word.

Evelyn sighed. This is going to be a long night.
###Chapter 96

"Didn't I tell you to arrange hot coffee for your fans? It's freezing out there, and they've been standing for hours supporting you. Don't you care about them at all?" Isabelle Laurent snapped the moment she arrived backstage.

Her sharp gaze swept over the scene—other celebrities' fans were bundled in blankets with warm drinks, while Sebastian Hart's loyal supporters shivered in the cold. As his manager, she couldn't stomach the neglect.

Sebastian's expression darkened at the public scolding. "Shouldn’t that be your job?"

"I delegated it to you because I was handling your other messes," Isabelle shot back, voice icy. "Today of all days, when you need their support, you forget? And this isn’t the first time I’ve reminded you!"

"One slip-up, and you act like it’s the end of the world?" Sebastian scoffed, irritation flaring.

"One slip-up?" Isabelle repeated, incredulous. Though she’d already decided to leave him as a client, his audacity still infuriated her.

"Fine, I’ll have my assistant get the coffee now. Happy?"

"I’m angry because you never listen—"

"Enough. I’ll order delivery. Faster. Satisfied?"

Isabelle’s lips thinned. "Don’t bother with your half-hearted efforts."

"I was going to fix it, and now you’re refusing? Are you trying to pick a fight?" Sebastian snapped.

Isabelle hadn’t intended to argue. She’d simply stepped in to fix his mistake—again—even smoothing things over with the fans on his behalf. Even if she planned to drop him, she wouldn’t abandon her professional duties.

Just then, Sebastian’s assistant returned, looking flustered.

"Where the hell were you?" Isabelle demanded.

The assistant blinked. "I—I was delivering a latte to Ms. Delacroix."

Silence. Every head in the room swiveled toward Sebastian.

Though he, Adrian Cross, and Seraphina Delacroix had been rehearsing together lately, rumors had already started swirling about Sebastian and Seraphina’s close working relationship. Adrian’s easygoing demeanor made the gossip seem baseless—until now.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing, instead shooting Isabelle a look that clearly said, Fix this for me.

After all, she always cleaned up his messes.

This time, Isabelle only smirked and walked away, leaving him to flounder.

Sebastian suddenly grabbed her wrist and dragged her out of the room. "We need to talk."

The moment they left, backstage erupted into whispers.

Good grief. When he’s arrogant, he’s shameless. When he’s embarrassed, he’s pathetic. Evelyn Sinclair’s mental commentary nearly made Julian and Genevieve choke on their drinks.

Honestly? Accurate.

Meanwhile, the Quirk family—seated in the audience—were furiously texting updates to those missing the drama. The only one absent was Nathan Blackwood, still buried in work.

Ugh, the audacity! Evelyn mentally sneered. Sebastian actually thought Isabelle was hard on him because she had feelings for him?

In a private room, Isabelle crossed her arms. "Are you deaf, or just delusional?"

Sebastian exhaled dramatically. "Look, I’ve talked to Adrian. He’s fine with it. He’ll even help manage the backlash."

Isabelle stared, momentarily speechless. Then, out of sheer disbelief, she asked, "Adrian agreed? His fans will tear you apart! Even if yours don’t care about you dating, they won’t tolerate you stealing his girlfriend. Are you trying to ruin your career?"

Sebastian gave her a pitying look. "Adrian’s willing to spin the narrative. The three of us are on board. What’s the issue?"

A sharp crack echoed through the hallway as Isabelle’s palm met his face. She stormed out, aura dark enough to freeze the staff in their tracks.

Oh, he got slapped, Evelyn mused, prompting Julian and Genevieve to perk up.

Serves him right! Evelyn’s thoughts continued. Does he think this is some medieval harem drama? Newsflash—you can’t have a wife at home and a mistress at work and expect everyone to play nice. He just spat on years of friendship. I bet Isabelle wishes she could go back and slap her past self for signing him.

Genevieve grimaced, typing furiously into the group chat.

Julian wasn’t surprised. The entertainment industry thrived on these twisted arrangements.

When Sebastian returned, his cheek was faintly red.

Guess he’s back to being shameless, Evelyn thought, amused.

Soon, Adrian and Seraphina joined them, the latter happily sipping her latte.

Evelyn kept digging. Nathan had been right—after striking a deal with Sebastian, Adrian had proposed a PR strategy: paint Isabelle as the villain who’d broken up Sebastian and Seraphina years ago. Now, with the "misunderstanding cleared," Adrian would "graciously step aside," and the reunited couple would get their happy ending.

Sebastian had some shame—he’d vetoed the idea, but only because he wanted a better way to exploit Isabelle.

Disgusting, Genevieve typed. He’s worse than trash.

Julian’s lips curled. It’s like demanding gratitude from the person you stabbed.

Why not blame Mr. Lynch? Evelyn wondered. Oh, right—because they’re cowards.

The Quirk family silently agreed: Human garbage.

As the live stream countdown began, the trio took the stage, ready to perform their twisted fairy tale.

###Chapter 97

In the waiting area, only two groups remained—Evelyn Sinclair and Julian Blackwood among them. The atmosphere was thick with boredom as everyone's eyes remained glued to the massive screen before them.

The trio’s performance wasn’t terrible, but the storyline was painfully predictable. Even without watching, one could guess the next twist.

Sebastian Hart, playing the celestial lord, fell in love with a mortal woman, Seraphina Delacroix, after enduring countless trials. Seraphina, in turn, rescued the injured demon lord, Adrian Cross.

The three of them enacted a series of melodramatic scenes in the mortal realm. Only at the climax did the celestial lord’s true identity come to light, forcing him to return to his divine duties.

The live audience was unimpressed, and the online viewership steadily dwindled.

The barrage of comments, once explosive, had dulled to a trickle. Only when the play first began had the chat erupted with excitement.

Fans of Adrian and Sebastian were civil, but an undercurrent of rivalry persisted.

Sebastian excelled in medieval fantasy, while Adrian dominated teen dramas. Since they were collaborating, neither could overshadow the other.

Sebastian had joined the show to reinvent his image. With such a prestigious platform and professional backing, his fans expected something groundbreaking—a chance to showcase his versatility.

Yet here he was, stuck in yet another medieval fantasy.

Adrian’s fans weren’t having it.

One typed: So our idol is just a side character now?

The tension escalated as they turned on Sebastian’s supporters.

Sebastian’s fans were equally frustrated. His roles had become repetitive—always the same archetype. They craved something fresh, something that would reveal new depths to his talent.

A netizen chimed in: This is just the first round. Maybe they’re testing the waters before revealing their real dynamic.

Another added: At least your idol isn’t being dragged down by scandal.

A third snapped: Sebastian’s never done medieval fantasy before. This is his chance to shine. Stop complaining when you’re already winning.

The chat devolved into petty squabbles, with barely any discussion about the actual plot.

Even Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe exchanged disappointed glances. "I don’t get why they picked this script," Preston muttered. "It’s painfully dull. This round’s a lost cause."

Just then, a collective gasp erupted from the audience.

The waiting guests stiffened, eyes widening.

The chat exploded.

On screen, the celestial lord confronted his love before his departure. But the mortal woman, believing herself unworthy, pretended to choose the demon lord.

Seraphina melted into Adrian’s embrace. Then—right in front of Sebastian—Adrian kissed her, a bold claim of possession.

Sebastian didn’t back down. He yanked Seraphina away, pulling her into a fierce, passionate kiss of his own.

The angle left no room for doubt—this wasn’t staged.

They actually kissed.

Even for a performance, this was scandalous.

Sebastian had just kissed Seraphina—in front of her boyfriend.

The audience was more riveted by the off-screen drama than the play itself.

Gossip was irresistible, after all.

The other actors in the waiting area smirked, assuming this was a desperate ploy for attention.

But for stars of their caliber, such tactics were risky—fans could easily turn on them.

I thought they’d scrapped this plotline, Evelyn mused. But the second they had the chance, they brought it back.

Julian suspected this was a calculated move—preparing fans for an upcoming relationship shake-up.

Evelyn studied the trio’s expressions. Only Adrian seemed close to breaking character.

One viewer typed: Why can’t the mortal woman be with the celestial lord if she’s already with the demon lord?

Another speculated: Maybe the demon lord forced her.

A third lamented: All this drama for nothing…

A fourth pointed out: Did anyone notice how shady that fairy was? She clearly wanted the celestial lord for herself.

Evelyn’s lips thinned. Disgusting. Sebastian had pretended to rely on Isabelle Laurent, but this entire performance was a setup.

On the surface, it was just a cliché plot—but beneath, they were subtly framing Isabelle as the villainous second lead.

Julian smirked inwardly. They know how netizens think. Once this blows up, people will connect the dots—and Isabelle will take the fall.

Backstage, Isabelle stared at the screen, face darkening. Realization dawned, chilling her to the core.

Genevieve, Marcus Donovan, and Lillian Graves exchanged hushed words before Marcus approached Isabelle.

He handed her a business card—one Julian had custom-made under his agency’s name.

Isabelle blinked. "What’s this?"

Marcus smiled. "Given your connections, you’ve probably heard we’re expanding overseas. We need a skilled agent."

Isabelle hesitated. She hadn’t even considered her next move—yet here was an offer.

Marcus chuckled. "No pressure. Just putting it out there. We’ll talk later."

With that, he turned back to the screen, leaving Isabelle to process the whirlwind of betrayal—and opportunity.
###Chapter 98

Fate had a cruel sense of humor, weaving the celestial lord and the mortal lady together time and again, despite her desperate attempts to resist his relentless pursuit. His love was a force of nature, impossible to deny, even as she fought against it with every fiber of her being.

Meanwhile, the fairy—clumsy, jealous, and utterly transparent in her schemes—tried in vain to tear them apart. Her efforts only served to highlight the depth of their bond, making her interference laughable at best.

Then came the moment that shattered everything.

Their stolen kiss was witnessed by the demon lord, igniting a fury that set the celestial and demonic realms ablaze. War erupted, shaking the very foundations of existence. And once again, the mortal lady stood between them, taking the brunt of the devastation.

Only when death loomed over her did the truth spill from her lips.

She had been dying all along. Her time with the demon lord? A desperate ploy—one last chance to see the celestial lord before the end. Because from the very beginning, her heart had belonged to him alone.

The revelation shattered the demon lord. Consumed by grief, he vanished into the shadows, leaving behind only echoes of his sorrow.

The celestial lord, however, was broken beyond repair. As the mortal lady drew her last breath in his arms, his anguished cries tore through the heavens. His heart, once whole, now lay in pieces. And madness took hold.

The Audience Reacts

The live comments surged, viewers pouring in, their emotions raw and unfiltered.

"Why did it have to end like this? I can't breathe."

"There was no other way. Everything she did—she did for him."

"How is he supposed to survive without her?"

"The demon lord deserved better. He loved her too. Why couldn’t she see that?"

"I swear, if the celestial lord doesn’t slaughter that meddling fairy next, I’ll riot."

Descent into Darkness

Cloaked in black, eyes burning crimson, the celestial lord—now the new demon lord—ravaged the underworld, searching for any trace of her reincarnation. But she was gone. Her soul, he believed, had been obliterated.

With nothing left to lose, he vowed to drag the celestial realm down with him. Vengeance would be his final act.

And true to his word, the first life he claimed was the fairy’s—the one who had tried to sever their love.

The Goddess’s Return

Then, as the cosmos trembled on the brink of annihilation, she reappeared—not as the mortal lady, but as the goddess she had always been.

Born from the will of heaven, her purpose was clear: protect the world, maintain balance. Her mortal existence had been but a trial, a test of her spirit. Now, restored to her true form, she stood before him—ethereal, untouchable.

"Let go of your obsession," she urged, her voice like distant chimes. "Surrender willingly."

But the celestial lord—no, the demon lord now—only reached for her. "Stay with me."

Her answer was a blade to his heart.

"I cannot. My duty is to the realms, not to you."

A lie. A cruel, necessary lie.

Because the truth was far more dangerous.

The Final Stand

As the demon lord’s rage threatened to consume all existence, the goddess made her choice.

She would sacrifice herself to save the world.

But he refused to lose her again.

In a desperate gambit, he seized the demon lord—his former rival—and threatened the lives of every being across the three realms.

"If you dare leave me again, I will burn it all to ash."

Yet, when the moment came—when the goddess stood before him, tears streaming down her face—he faltered.

Her whispered words shattered him anew.

"I was wrong. I love you. It’s always been you."

And with that, he let go.

The Aftermath

The audience was in ruins.

"I’m not okay. I will never be okay."

"That ending… I can’t even."

"‘My love for you is eternal faith’—I’m sobbing."

Backstage, Danielle watched the reactions with wary eyes. The online storm was brewing, and she had no intention of being caught in the crossfire.

Meanwhile, Preston and Donovan exchanged tense glances as the numbers climbed. The episode was a success—but at what cost?

Then, the narrator’s voice cut through the silence like a blade.

"When deities fall in love, the realms tremble. When deities love, the innocent suffer."

The screen exploded with confusion.

"Wait—another celestial drama? After that masterpiece?"

"Is this intentional? That line was in the last play too!"

"Hold on… is this a setup?"

The lights flared to life, revealing a peaceful village—Julian tilling the fields, Evelyn weaving, grandparents laughing with children. A perfect, ordinary life.

Then—the mist rolled in.

And the screen behind them flickered to life, showing three masked figures, their auras unmistakably divine.

The man in white faced the man in black, a woman caught between them.

"Stop. Don’t fight over me anymore."

Lightning cracked. The ground shook.

And an unfathomable power erupted, swallowing everything in its path.

The villagers froze—then screamed, clutching each other as their world collapsed around them.

###Chapter 99

The scene on the screen played on relentlessly. The trio was utterly consumed by their web of love and resentment, completely oblivious to the destruction they left in their wake.

Helpless mortals scattered in terror—weeping, screaming, begging—but their cries fell on deaf ears. The gods' petty squabbles reduced everything to rubble, erasing generations of hard work in mere moments. The village lay in ruins, a wasteland of shattered lives.

When the love triangle finally reached its dramatic conclusion, the three didn’t even glance back at the devastation. The man in white vanished into the sky, while the man in black spirited the woman away.

As the lights dimmed, the venue plunged into stunned silence. For a heartbeat, even the barrage of online comments paused—until, like a tidal wave, viewership surged as word spread.

Preston and Donovan were drenched in cold sweat. Why are they doing this again? Filming this show is literally stealing years from our lives! They exchanged frantic glances. They might as well have just replayed Team Duo Alpha’s performance as a parody! This is brutal! Did Team Duo Alpha offend them somehow?

Even the backstage crew trembled. Their special effects—nearly identical to those used in the previous performance—made them look like accomplices in Team A-List’s ruthless takedown. They braced for the inevitable backlash from Team Duo Alpha’s furious fanbase.

Meanwhile, the audience sat frozen, hearts pounding. The romantic fantasy they’d just witnessed had twisted into something dark and absurd.

Offstage, Sebastian, Adrian, and Seraphina glared at the screen, fists clenched. This wasn’t just competition—it was a targeted attack. Team A-List had turned their performance into a punchline.

The live comments exploded.

"This is blatant sabotage! They’re mocking our idols to prop themselves up. How vile!"

"I used to respect them, but this? They’ll do anything to win."

"Team A-List has no integrity. They’re just bullies hiding behind ‘artistic interpretation.’"

Defenders fired back:

"Team Duo Alpha’s fans need to chill. These are standard fantasy tropes. If their idols used them first, why can’t Team A-List?"

"Maybe your idols should’ve picked a less clichéd plot. This is what happens when you recycle tired storylines."

A neutral viewer chimed in: "Okay, Team A-List is definitely throwing shade, but their take is way more compelling. The gods’ drama literally destroyed innocent lives. That’s the real tragedy."

Twitter erupted. Debates raged, but public opinion remained split.

Onstage, the horror continued.

The lights rose on returning villagers—only for them to find their loved ones gone, their homes obliterated. The injured wailed; the dead were buried. Rivers ran dry, crops withered, and plague spread. Survivors huddled at the temple’s steps, broken.

Julian’s character collapsed. Then Evelyn’s, her final whisper cutting through the silence: "They were supposed to protect us. Do they even care? If they exist… why did they abandon us?"

But the worst was yet to come.

The celestial war raged—sparked by nothing more than a lovers’ quarrel. Smoke engulfed the stage as rapid flashes showed:

—A wedding reduced to ashes.
—A scholar’s life’s work burning.
—A mother cradling her lifeless child.
—A king’s desperate plea to the heavens: "If they won’t save us, why do they get to destroy us? They don’t deserve our faith!"

The screen lingered on the man in white cradling the woman as they disappeared—oblivious to the hell they’d unleashed.

The lights faded.

Silence.

Then—chaos.

###Chapter 100

The auditorium plunged into stunned silence. Even Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe stood frozen, their expressions blank with shock.

What unfolded on stage was no ordinary performance—it was a scathing critique of celestial romance tropes, exposing the collateral damage left in the wake of divine lovers' whims.

Though Evelyn Sinclair's role was minor compared to the theater majors surrounding her, her presence amplified the production's impact tenfold. The raw emotion eclipsed even Team Young Again's earlier confrontation.

Offstage, Margaret and Sophia Blackwood's eyes glistened with unshed tears. Beside them, Richard let out a choked sob, his gaze locked onto Julian's portrayal of the tormented king.

Backstage, Genevieve clung to Lillian Graves, her shoulders shaking. "Didn't you watch their rehearsals?" Lillian asked.

Genevieve sniffled. "But—but seeing it live is different!"

Marcus Donovan kept refreshing social media, his fingers tense. Isabelle Laurent smirked. "Stop worrying. They've already won."

Marcus blinked. Isabelle's smile widened. "You picked the perfect theme. And thank you..."

His brow arched. Sharp as ever, Isabelle had seen right through his strategy.

Meanwhile, the other teams shot venomous looks at Sebastian Hart and Adrian Cross—particularly after their earlier cheers for Team A-list.

Sebastian's face burned crimson, fists clenched. Adrian watched him warily.

The contrast between their shallow performance and this masterpiece was a brutal indictment. It wasn't just defeat—it was humiliation.

Elsewhere, Seraphina Delacroix wept openly. Some pitied her; overshadowed by Team A-list's brilliance, her efforts seemed tragically insignificant.

Online, the reaction was volcanic.

Comment: This is what happens when gods play with mortal lives!

Reply: We always rooted for the leads, but WE'RE the ones who'd suffer in their world!

Comment: Why should entire villages drown for their love story? Unacceptable.

The backlash against typical fantasy romances grew fiercer:

Comment: Date or break up, but stop massacring bystanders!

Reply: Exactly! Since when is emotional abuse "romantic"?

Yet dissenters remained:

Comment: It's just fiction—why overanalyze? Let people enjoy things!

Reply: Team A-list is clearly targeting specific shows. Petty much?

Onstage, the narrative twisted again.

Evelyn's character ascended from mortal suffering to godhood—only to witness the same cycle repeat. Julian, now the Celestial Lord, and the supporting actress reprised their toxic dynamic, oblivious as their tantrums sank fleets and drowned coasts.

Audience groans multiplied.

Comment: Not this "chase me, hurt me" nonsense AGAIN.

Then—Evelyn struck.

Her blade plunged into Julian's chest. The goddess gasped. "Who ARE you?"

Evelyn's voice rang cold. "We are the voices you drowned for love."

The crowd erupted.

Comment: YES! FINALLY someone held them accountable!

Reply: This changes EVERYTHING.

Backstage, Sebastian looked ready to combust. Isabelle gripped his arm. "Composure. The cameras are watching."

He swallowed hard. She was right.

But the damage was done. Team A-list hadn't just outperformed them—they'd rewritten the rules of the game.
###Chapter 101 - A Sliver of Her Soul

The supporting cast had delivered such mesmerizing performances that the audience was completely swept away in the drama.

No one noticed Evelyn Sinclair lingering at the edge of the stage, her piercing gaze detached, observing everything with cold precision.

That was, until she stepped forward—her sword flashing—and impaled the celestial lord mid-confession to the goddess. The shock of it jolted everyone awake.

Just moments before, Evelyn had clawed her way out of mortal purgatory, ascending to immortality with vengeance burning in her veins.

Her voice, sharp as steel, cut through the air: "I am the wrath of every soul you destroyed."

The audience shuddered. Even the studio crew, caught off guard, gasped. Online viewers erupted.

Netizen: Holy—did NOT see that coming.
Netizen: FINALLY someone shut them up. I was ready to throw my screen.
Netizen: The world’s ending, and these two are still sobbing over their tragic love? Pathetic. Good riddance.
Netizen: Did y’all catch Sebastian Hart’s face in the waiting room? Priceless.

Sebastian, despite his usual composure, looked like he’d been slapped. His jaw clenched, his expression twisted—as if he were the one betrayed. The grand, tragic romance he’d poured his heart into? Reduced to a joke.

Humiliation burned through him. That he didn’t storm off was a miracle.

His fans were livid.

Fan: How dare Evelyn do this to him?!
Fan: Since when can’t deities love? Why should the goddess be sacrificed? Hypocrites!
Fan: Oh please. If you care so much, why don’t YOU die for their love story?

The celestial lord wasn’t dead—yet. But the wound was deep, and he collapsed into the goddess’s arms.

Desperate, she channeled her divine power to heal him, tears streaking her face as she stared at Evelyn. "What vengeful spirits? What are you talking about?"

Evelyn’s answer was a stinging slap. "Still playing innocent?"

The goddess recoiled, her cheek reddening, eyes wide with shock. Evelyn seized her throat, forcing her to watch—really watch—the devastation they’d caused.

Images flashed across the stage: cities in ruins, screams echoing, lives snuffed out like candle flames.

The goddess trembled. "I didn’t know—I swear!"

Another slap. "You were mortal once. Or did you forget the moment you got wings?"

"No! I love humanity—"

"Then where were you when he slaughtered them to lure you out?"

Netizen: Exactly! Suddenly she ‘remembers’ her duty when it’s HER lover at stake.
Netizen: If she’d stayed hidden, maybe the world wouldn’t be ash.
Netizen: We’re just props in their drama. Disgusting.

The goddess turned to her wounded lover, voice breaking. "He was noble before I corrupted him. It’s my fault."

Evelyn’s laugh was ice. "Ask the dead if they care about your guilt." She yanked the celestial lord up. "Monsters don’t get redemption."

The goddess screamed as Evelyn hurled him into the abyss.

Silence.

Then—"Why him?" The goddess crumpled, sobbing. "If anyone should die, it’s me!"

Cue Julian Blackwood’s dramatic reappearance, pristine in white, as if the script demanded a last-minute twist.

The goddess lunged for him—only for Evelyn to snap a chain around his throat.

"Not so fast."

Netizen: Evelyn Sinclair, destroyer of delusions. I stan.
Netizen: Sebastian’s fans malding rn.
Netizen: This isn’t a love story. It’s a reckoning.

###Chapter 102: You Deserve To Die Too

The goddess stared at Evelyn in disbelief, her voice trembling. "He barely survived. What more do you want from him?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a chilling smile. "I am the embodiment of countless vengeful souls. Justice demands retribution." Her gaze hardened. "Do you truly believe your sins require no atonement? Where, then, does justice lie in this world?"

Tears streamed down the goddess’s face as she pleaded, "This is all my fault. I am a goddess. I should never have let my emotions cloud my judgment—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Exactly. You shouldn’t have. You’ve hidden behind passivity for too long, avoiding guilt and blame. How convenient."

The goddess froze, stunned into silence.

Though weakened, the celestial lord immediately stepped forward in defense. "We saved the world. Isn’t that enough?"

The goddess regained her composure, nodding fervently. "He sacrificed himself for the greater good. Doesn’t that absolve him?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Saving the world was your duty. That doesn’t erase the chaos you caused."

The celestial lord bristled. "Why must she be the one to suffer? Has anyone considered her feelings? I took her place—isn’t that sacrifice enough?"

Evelyn’s eyes flashed with contempt as she pointed at him. "You, the celestial lord, were nurtured by the heavens, entrusted with maintaining cosmic order." She then turned to the goddess. "And you—created to protect mortals, to shelter all life."

Before they could protest, Evelyn continued, her voice dripping with scorn. "You were granted power, worship, and devotion from the very beginning. That was the price of your duties. To speak of sacrifice is laughable! You abandoned your responsibilities, indulged in selfish desires, and let thousands perish. And now, you dare use your basic obligations as atonement?" She stepped closer, her voice a blade. "You are unworthy of your titles, undeserving of worship. You don’t deserve to rule—or to love."

The celestial lord’s face twisted in fury. "Is love forbidden to deities?"

Evelyn smirked. "Love all you want—after you renounce your divinity. Become mortals, stripped of your privileges. Then you can wallow in romance without consequence."

Both deities paled.

"Ah, never considered that, did you?" Evelyn sneered. "If you truly cared, you’d step down. But no—you cling to your power while demanding the freedom to love. Hypocrites." Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "Look at the corpses beneath your feet. Since when did slaughtering innocents for love become noble?"

The audience erupted in agreement.

"Hell yes!" someone shouted, echoing the collective sentiment. Online, the tide had turned completely.

Netizen: So they want divine privileges without divine responsibilities? Pathetic.

Netizen: We pray for protection, not for a celestial soap opera!

Netizen: If they can’t do their jobs, they should resign. Plenty of others would do better.

Netizen: Why worship deities who don’t care about us? I’d rather switch religions.

Netizen: Love is fine—just not at the cost of innocent lives.

Seraphina Delacroix, secluded from the waiting area, clenched her phone, her lips pressed into a thin line. This wasn’t part of the plan. They were supposed to evoke sympathy, not outrage.

Meanwhile, Genevieve and Lillian scrolled through Twitter, grinning as the backlash grew.

"Do you think Sebastian will abandon her now?" Marcus mused.

Isabelle Laurent smirked. "Doesn’t matter. I’ve already given up on him."

The online storm raged on, the final act unfolding.

As Evelyn raised her sword, the goddess begged, "He’s changed! Let us retreat in penance—"

Evelyn’s blade pierced her chest before she could finish.

"Penance?" Evelyn spat. "You mean hiding in paradise to continue your love story?" She yanked the sword free, her voice icy. "You, drenched in innocent blood, don’t deserve rebirth or happiness. If you want redemption, suffer through the Cycle of Rebirth—experience every agony you caused." Her eyes burned with defiance. "The universe runs on karma. If the gods won’t deliver justice, I will."

The studio erupted in cheers.

Justice, at last.
###Chapter 103: The Divine Reckoning


The final act of the stage play reached its crescendo as Evelyn Sinclair, embodying the wrath of the forsaken, struck down the celestial deities. Their spirits were cast not into oblivion, but into the Illusion of Echoes—a tormenting cycle where they relived every life they had extinguished, from hope to despair, over and over.

Evelyn, her voice dripping with icy resolve, scattered the stolen divine power across the earth like stardust. The energy, born from millennia of mortal faith, now healed the wounds of the vengeful dead, granting them peace. "You were never worthy of their devotion," she whispered, her silhouette fading into the dimming stage lights as the narration boomed:

"Can you bear the weight of their faith? Or will you crumble beneath it?"

The audience sat in stunned silence before erupting into applause. Among them, Richard Blackwood, Margaret, and Sophia Blackwood exchanged proud glances, rising to their feet in unison. Team A-List had not just performed—they’d ignited a reckoning.

Backstage, the producers gaped at the skyrocketing social media metrics. Team A-List’s audacious finale—a scathing indictment of hollow idolatry—had eclipsed Team Duo Alpha’s saccharine love story. Twitter was ablaze:

Netizen 1: "Pathetic. Sebastian Hart’s ‘transformation’ was just another brooding knight. At least Evelyn Sinclair’s rookie stiffness had substance."
Netizen 2: "Where’s Adrian Cross’s fan army now? Still claiming his ‘sacrifice’ was profound? Please."
Netizen 3: "Team Duo Alpha’s script was a train wreck. Their agency should be ashamed."

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Julian descended the stage, their exit as dramatic as their performance. "Honestly," Evelyn mused, "we just gave the audience what they really wanted—a mirror."

The Quirks, lurking backstage, barely stifled laughter. There, amidst the tension, stood Sebastian Hart, jaw clenched, Adrian Cross scowling, and Seraphina Delacroix—eyes red-rimmed—clutching Adrian’s arm like a lifeline.

Adrian, never one for subtlety, stepped forward. "Was this necessary? We didn’t even cross you."

Julian paused, his gaze glacial. The air thickened.

Evelyn bit back a grin. Oh, this isn’t about the script. It’s about their derailed ‘secret girlfriend’ PR plan. Her thoughts, sharp as daggers, spilled into the silence: Adrian, darling, your desperation is showing.

The Quirks coughed into their sleeves. Even Julian’s mask of indifference cracked.

Sebastian, meanwhile, shot a desperate look at Isabelle Laurent—his former manager, now indifferent. Without her damage control, he was adrift.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Unjust? No. Entertaining? Absolutely."

The tension snapped like a bowstring. Somewhere, a camera flashed. The gossip mill would feast tonight.

###Chapter 104: Orchestrating A Distraction To Deflect Conflict

At that moment, Sebastian stepped forward, positioning himself beside Adrian, signaling his agreement. But he missed the sudden spark of admiration in Adrian’s eyes as the latter stole subtle glances at him.

Regaining his composure, Julian shrugged nonchalantly. "You didn’t. It was just a battle of wits—survival of the fittest. Why wouldn’t we use a better strategy if we had one? Haven’t you ever sacrificed others for your own gain?"

Seriously, Julian, you’re starting to sound like the antagonist here. But you’re not wrong. These three are worse. They were willing to throw Isabelle under the bus just to fuel their little love triangle. How dare they question us? At least we played fair.

The Blackwoods stifled their laughter, biting their lips to keep from grinning.

Julian’s blunt response left the trio stunned.

They had expected excuses, justifications—anything but this raw honesty. Adrian and Sebastian exchanged bewildered glances, caught off guard.

Sebastian, never one for confrontation, instinctively searched for Isabelle in the crowd. But like before, she refused to meet his gaze.

For the first time, Sebastian felt truly alone—like he was walking a tightrope without a safety net, an unsettling weight pressing on his chest.

Just as the tension became unbearable, Adrian’s manager rushed in, breaking the standoff.

After the initial chaos settled, a private meeting was called—undoubtedly about the disastrous stage play.

Outside, a live post-match interview was underway. The trio clearly intended to use this as damage control.

Soon, Isabelle returned, her expression stormy.

Curious glances followed her.

"Why is she alone? Didn’t they all go to the meeting together?" the Blackwoods murmured among themselves.

After all, Isabelle was still technically Sebastian’s manager. Their contract hadn’t been terminated yet.

Evelyn, while having her makeup retouched, studied Isabelle closely.

Oh, she’s furious.

The Blackwoods perked up, eager for details.

The company had proposed several PR strategies to salvage the idols’ reputations. Being the professional she was, Isabelle had suggested the most straightforward one: a public apology for their poor script choice, owning their mistake, and promising improvement. No theatrics needed.

The Blackwoods considered it. A sincere apology might actually work—people tended to soften when faced with humility.

Julian, ever the strategist, agreed. Sometimes, vulnerability was the strongest armor.

But shockingly, all three rejected the idea. Seraphina even had the audacity to imply Isabelle’s reluctance stemmed from her past with Sebastian. Then, with fake tears, she begged for Isabelle’s help.

A Blackwood scoffed. "The audacity! Seraphina’s putting on a show for Sebastian, manipulating him into turning against Isabelle later."

The dim-witted Sebastian lashed out, accusing Isabelle of incompetence and dismissing her outright. That’s why she’d stormed back alone.

The Blackwoods rolled their eyes. Does he really think he’s that special?

The moment Isabelle left, the trio schemed. Damn, they’re already moving? Sebastian, you’re truly heartless.

A "leaked" rehearsal photo surfaced online—Isabelle holding the script, overseeing the scenes.

An "insider" spilled: Team Duo Alpha’s original script was about honor and sacrifice, not romance. Their manager forced the changes. The intimate scenes? All her idea—to grab attention. Longtime fans know Sebastian has no say. His manager controls everything. This fiasco isn’t his fault. She miscalculated, thinking their usual tricks could rival Team A-List.

The comments exploded.

How could a manager be this stupid? Or was there an ulterior motive?

The narrative shifted instantly. Managers betraying their artists wasn’t unheard of. Maybe negotiations went south. Maybe revenge was at play.

Fans, ever loyal, redirected their fury. Hashtags like #JusticeForSebastian and #FreeSebastianFromControl trended, painting Isabelle as the villain.

The live chat, once mocking Team Duo Alpha, now demanded Isabelle apologize on air.

Truthful staff members pitied Isabelle but were powerless against the tide.

The director and producer stayed silent, unwilling to meddle.

The Blackwoods, however, were livid. They nudged Julian, who gave Marcus a meaningful look.

Marcus approached Isabelle cautiously. "Need help?"

Isabelle lifted her icy gaze, a humorless laugh escaping her lips. "If I can’t handle this, why would you even want me?"

Marcus smirked. "Point taken. You’re unstoppable."
###Chapter 105: The Queen of Savage Clapbacks

"For Sebastian's plan to succeed, Isabelle must be willing to take the fall," Julian analyzed coolly.

Evelyn arched a brow. "If this were the old Isabelle, sacrificing herself for her artists wouldn’t be a big deal. Managers and their stars are a package deal—as long as the artist stays marketable, the money keeps flowing. But now…"

Genevieve sighed. "It’s insane that Sebastian would dare pull this stunt, given how strained things are between them."

Margaret scoffed. "That arrogant fool is too confident, thinking Isabelle wouldn’t dare ruin him."

Sophia blinked in disbelief. "He can’t seriously believe Isabelle still has feelings for him, right?"

Nathan and Julian exchanged glances, both thinking Sebastian couldn’t possibly be that delusional.

Marcus returned, and the entire Blackwood family turned to him with expectant stares.

He smirked. "Relax, we don’t need to lift a finger!"

"What about call logs or DMs? Anything we can leak?" Genevieve asked eagerly.

Marcus shook his head. "That’s a kamikaze move—like burning the enemy’s house down while standing in the flames. Isabelle would never recover from that kind of blow."

The Blackwoods, mere spectators in this drama, frowned in confusion.

Marcus leaned in. "Think about it. All the rumors are just hearsay. Team Alpha hasn’t said a word publicly. If Isabelle suddenly drops receipts, shifting all blame onto them, it’s outright betrayal. Rational fans will see the truth. The irrational ones?"

Understanding dawned on their faces.

Rational fans would remember—who picked the script? Why was Isabelle thrown under the bus?

Irrational fans? They’d spiral into conspiracy theories.

They wouldn’t blame Sebastian for orchestrating this. No, they’d believe he was innocent, that Isabelle had betrayed him instead of protecting him.

Marcus smirked. "And worst of all? Her reputation in the industry would be shredded. No one would work with her unless she quits—and she’s not that reckless."

Just as Marcus prepared to elaborate, the family’s expressions shifted. They’d already lost interest.

Marcus: "…?"

Evelyn, having already seen Isabelle’s next move through the Gossip System, was already scrolling Twitter, grinning like a cat with cream.

The fallout was glorious.

Fans who’d dragged Isabelle were now eating their words.

The setup was simple—a leaked photo of Sebastian and Seraphina full-on making out.

The image had circulated before but was dismissed as poor-quality Photoshop.

All Isabelle had to do? Amplify its reach with a savage caption:

"Sebastian didn’t look forced at all. In fact, he was practicing very earnestly backstage."

Evelyn snorted. Queen of clapbacks.

The Blackwoods had seen the photo earlier, but paired with that caption? They were struggling not to cackle.

A gossip account picked it up instantly.

By the time Team Alpha took the stage for the final segment, Sebastian and his crew looked smug, convinced their smear campaign had worked.

Nathan and Evelyn kept straight faces during the interview, discussing acting techniques and scripts with practiced ease.

Meanwhile, Team Alpha subtly trashed their own script while praising Team Elite’s.

Evelyn and Nathan coughed violently, faces turning red.

Team Alpha probably mistook their reaction for shock at their "generosity."

Reality? They were dying of laughter.

Twitter Explosion:

Netizen 1: "Rehearsal? ON THE ROOF? Sure, Jan."

Netizen 2: "That wasn’t a kiss—that was a full-on soul exchange. If that’s ‘forced,’ I’ll eat my phone."

Netizen 3: "Sebastian stans, explain this: Even if Isabelle controlled him, how’d she force Seraphina and Adrian into this mess? Y’all look dumb."

Netizen 4: "A man who blames his manager for his own failures? Trash. Unfollowed."

Diehard Fan: "FAKE NEWS! This is Team Elite’s plot to ruin Sebastian!"

Netizen 5: "So… he didn’t cheat with his co-star’s girlfriend? Cool story."

Diehard Fan: "I TRUST HIM! This is Evelyn and Nathan’s fault! They poisoned him!"

By the time both teams returned backstage, the staff had tripled—all there for the drama.

Evelyn and Nathan exchanged glances.

This was going to be fun.

###Chapter 106: Does the Narcissist Not Care About His Reputation?

Adrian Cross’s agent was frantically refreshing his phone, but Twitter was still crashing. Oblivious to the brewing storm, he stepped out to arrange their return trip.

Meanwhile, Seraphina Delacroix’s fiercely loyal assistant was too preoccupied hiring ghostwriters to smear Isabelle Laurent’s reputation to notice anything else.

For a brief moment, Sebastian Hart remained composed as he approached Isabelle. Her icy glare told him everything—she knew exactly what they’d done.

Sebastian shifted uncomfortably but forced himself to speak. “Isabelle, we need to talk. Outside.”

Isabelle lifted her chin, her sharp gaze making his skin crawl.

“Did you really think I’d let you dump this mess on me again? That just because I’ve taken the fall before, I’d roll over and do it one more time?”

Sebastian’s face paled, his eyes darting around the crowded room. How dare she say this out loud here?!

Annoyed, he glowered at her. “Let’s take this outside.”

Isabelle scoffed. “No need. Once you sign this termination contract, we’re done. And don’t worry—I won’t publicly call you out for the script disaster.”

With that, she pulled a freshly prepared termination document from her bag and slapped it onto the table.

Gasps erupted around them.

Termination?! Had things really gone this far?

Everyone on set knew the truth—Sebastian had ignored all warnings and changed the script, only to fail spectacularly. Now, instead of owning his mistake, he was trying to pin it on Isabelle.

Out of respect for their past, Isabelle wasn’t dragging him through the mud. She’d take responsibility, then walk away. There was a quiet dignity in that.

The crew awkwardly lowered their heads, pretending to scroll through their phones—until three figures walked in, and their gazes snapped up.

Wait… Why is everyone staring at us? Adrian paused mid-step.

Seraphina frowned. Something’s off.

The Blackwood family members exchanged knowing glances, barely containing their excitement. Oh, this is going to be good.

Unaware, Sebastian pressed on. “Isabelle, is this really necessary? You’re just throwing a tantrum—”

Isabelle rolled her eyes. “I’ve told you before I wanted to terminate the contract. You ignored me, so I prepared everything myself. I’ve already signed. Now it’s your turn. Still think this is a tantrum?”

Sebastian froze.

“As for any remaining contracts, I’ll handle them legally. I’ll take whatever losses are mine. But we’re done. Now.”

Finally! The Blackwoods cheered internally. Trash belongs in the dumpster.

Isabelle slid a pen toward him.

“Y-You’re serious?” Sebastian stammered, glancing at Seraphina beside him. “You’re just jealous—”

Oh, for heaven’s sake.

Isabelle’s lip curled in disgust. “You think I’m jealous? Your delusions are impressive. And disgusting.”

The Blackwoods snickered. Does this narcissist even care about his reputation?

The crew pretended to work but strained to hear every word. Keep going! Don’t stop now!

Sebastian’s face flushed crimson. “Then why did you do so much for me? Negotiating contracts until you were sick, losing sleep to get me roles—”

The room buzzed with shock. He treated her like that after everything she did?!

Isabelle smirked. “If I trained a dog to act, I’d put in the same effort. It’s called professionalism.”

Sebastian staggered back like he’d been slapped.

The Blackwoods cackled. Even dogs are more loyal!

“I invested in you because you were useful,” Isabelle said coldly. “Now? You’re dead weight. And I have proof of every lie you’ve told. So sign it.”

Sebastian’s hands shook as the color drained from his face. “You’re really cutting me off?”

Why does he still sound like the victim?!

“Sebastian!” Adrian called sharply. Their eyes met—a silent understanding. Seraphina bit her lip, worry flashing in her gaze.

Isabelle nodded. “I keep my word. I won’t go public—unless you force my hand.”

“Fine. I trust you.” Sebastian scribbled his signature, then handed over the contract with a grave expression. “I owe you—”

“We’re even.” Isabelle cut him off, tucking the document away with satisfaction. Freedom.

The Blackwoods grinned. Oh, she’s already fought back—just not where they can see it.

The crew murmured about Isabelle’s “generosity”—until Adrian’s manager and Seraphina’s assistant burst in, nearly colliding at the door.

“Adrian, we have a problem!” his manager barked, glaring at Seraphina.

“Check your phone, now!” her assistant urged frantically.

Sebastian’s stomach dropped. He fumbled for his phone—and nearly collapsed.

Whirling on Isabelle, he demanded, “Did you do this?”
###Chapter 107: Assaulted by a Deranged Fan

Naturally, Evelyn wasn’t foolish enough to confess. At that moment, her acting skills could rival those of an Oscar-winning actress.

"What?"

Nathan’s expression darkened, his gaze unreadable as he struggled to discern the truth.

"Enough. Let’s return to the office and discuss this properly," Adrian interjected sharply, grabbing Nathan’s arm and shooting Evelyn a venomous glare before storming off.

He would never tolerate anyone hurting Nathan like this. It was pushing them to their limits.

Once the group had left, Marcus stepped forward, smirking. "Seems like the drama isn’t over yet."

"Let them come," Evelyn replied with an icy chuckle.

Julian approached, his tone formal. "Ms. Sinclair, on behalf of the agency, I’d like to formally invite you to join us."

Evelyn blinked in surprise before noticing Seraphina peeking at her from behind Julian, her bright eyes filled with encouragement. Team A-List truly was a breath of fresh air in this cutthroat industry.

"Thank you, but I can’t join a new team while dragging a scandal behind me. Once this storm passes, I’ll reach out." With a polite nod, Evelyn walked away alone.

She had clearly decided to face the brewing storm head-on. She likely already anticipated the backlash Nathan could unleash.

But retaliation? That was another matter entirely.

Tonight was going to be explosive. Better keep my phone close to catch all the drama firsthand!

The Blackwood family shared the same sentiment. After all, they had been following the gossip closely.

"Let’s go. My brother said he’d join us to celebrate your performance tonight," Sophia said, smiling as she approached.

Marcus quickly addressed the Blackwoods. "Please follow Lillian and exit through the back. Julian and Evelyn should leave through the front—there’s a crowd of fans waiting."

When Julian and Evelyn reached the entrance, Evelyn froze.

Outside, a sea of fans stretched endlessly, held back by a line of security guards.

"Why are there so many people?"

Julian sighed. "Some are my fans, but most are here for Team Duo Alpha."

"They haven’t left yet?" Julian asked, surprised.

"After that disaster? They snuck out the back like cowards," Marcus scoffed.

"Didn’t the staff tell the fans they were gone?" Evelyn asked curiously.

"They did. No one believed it."

Julian turned to Evelyn, his voice low. "Stay close. It’s chaotic out there."

Evelyn nodded.

The moment they stepped outside, deafening cheers erupted. Fans surged forward, their excitement barely contained by the security guards linking arms.

Amid the cheers, Evelyn heard angry shouts demanding answers about Team Duo Alpha. The hostility was palpable—no wonder they hadn’t dared to face their fans.

The crowd made movement nearly impossible. Just as the guards’ barrier threatened to break, a group of black-suited bodyguards stepped in—Nathan’s family security.

From a distance, Evelyn spotted Nathan, impeccably dressed, waiting by the car, his expression tense.

With the Blackwood bodyguards’ help, Julian and Evelyn finally made it to the vehicle. Julian clutched a stack of fan letters, making Evelyn curious—what did fans write to their idols?

Just as the car was about to move, a shrill voice pierced the air. "Evelyn! I’m your biggest fan! Please read my letter!"

Intrigued, Evelyn rolled down the window. A young girl, restrained by a bodyguard, waved a pink envelope frantically.

Nathan gave a subtle nod, and the bodyguard allowed the girl to approach.

As Evelyn reached for the letter, a glint of metal flashed.

"Move!" Nathan’s sharp command cut through the air as he yanked Evelyn back.

Gasps filled the car, but Evelyn barely registered them. All she could hear was Nathan’s rapid heartbeat behind her, all she could see was his arm shielding her.

The blade sliced through his suit sleeve, biting into the white shirt beneath. Blood bloomed instantly.

The girl’s face twisted in rage as she tried to strike again, but the bodyguard tackled her to the ground.

Chaos erupted. Cameras flashed.

"What does this have to do with you? The script was Julian’s, the fans are his! You’re just collateral damage!" Richard snapped, urging the driver to speed away.

"Don’t worry, it’s not deep," Sophia reassured, examining the wound with practiced ease.

Across from them, Margaret’s eyes welled with tears, but she squeezed Evelyn’s hand. "Don’t be scared, darling. Julian’s dealt with this before. Some fans are just… unstable."

Serena frowned. "Don’t blame yourself. Nathan told the guard to let her through. He brought this on himself."

That knife would’ve barely grazed me. But Nathan jumping in like that… He’s braver than I thought. I’ll have to thank him properly later.

Nathan shot her a sidelong glance. "Protecting you is my responsibility."

Ah, right. Duty above all. Protecting his wife—even in name only—is his priority. Can’t complain about the perks, though.

The Blackwoods exchanged uneasy glances. Despite their arrangement, Evelyn’s emotional distance was concerning. Before, she clung to him. Now? She acted like a stranger.

Even his heroic act hadn’t moved her to tears. Worrisome indeed.

While Evelyn accompanied Nathan to get patched up, the family huddled to strategize.

Julian arrived with the police to gather evidence. The attacker was an underage fan. Her parents, summoned by a frantic call, caused a scene at the station.

"Those parents are just as unhinged! They actually demanded the police arrest us, claiming we framed Sebastian!" Julian fumed.

"Of course Sebastian won’t help her," Evelyn said, stunned.

"Never. This is fan behavior—his agency won’t touch it, let alone him. Normally, Isabelle would’ve smoothed things over, but right now? Sebastian’s drowning in scandals. Best he can do is issue a generic apology and condemn the attack."

Marcus walked in, sighing. "They’ve already responded. Had to—it’s trending. Otherwise, they’d be buried in backlash."

Julian scoffed. "Wonder how those delusional fans will feel when their ‘idol’ apologizes to us and disowns them. What do you think, Evelyn? I say we sue."

Knowing Julian’s stubbornness, Marcus shot Evelyn a pleading look. "She’s underage. If she harms herself… Public opinion favors the underdog, not the victim. It’s a PR nightmare. You’re new—best to let this go."

Julian scowled.

Evelyn turned to Nathan. "You’re the injured party. Your call."

Nathan shrugged. "You and Julian were the targets. Decide together."

Just as Marcus relaxed, Evelyn glanced at Nathan’s bandaged arm and declared, "We sue."

Julian burst out laughing.

Marcus groaned.

"Age doesn’t excuse actions. Consequences exist for a reason. No depression claims, no suicide threats—if she hurts herself, that’s on her and her parents. We want justice. Even if the world turns against me, even if I have to leave this industry—so be it. It was never my endgame."

###Chapter 108: Frozen in Embarrassment

Nathan was taken aback—it wasn’t often that Evelyn wore such a serious expression.



But since she had insisted, Nathan had no choice but to issue a public statement addressing the situation.

When Evelyn turned around, she found both Julian and Nathan staring at her.

"What?" she asked, shifting uncomfortably under their scrutiny.

"You’re actually this angry?" Julian remarked, surprised.

"Huh? I’m not angry," Evelyn replied, confused.

With an awkward chuckle, Julian stood and excused himself.

Nathan studied her for a moment before saying, "Don’t be upset."

"I’m really not upset!" Evelyn groaned internally.

Ugh, this is so frustrating! I already said I’m fine! It’s not like I’m the one who got hurt! But it’s just unfair—someone getting special treatment just because they’re young? She slashed you, left a gaping wound that needed stitches, and there was so much blood! She should face consequences for what she did!

The corner of Nathan’s lips twitched upward.

A moment later, the silence was broken by a phone notification. Evelyn checked her screen and saw a post from her agency on Twitter—their stance was firm, echoing exactly what she had just voiced.

The statement also emphasized that the injured party was someone of utmost importance to Evelyn.

Perhaps the entertainment industry had been held hostage by young fans’ guilt trips for too long. Surprisingly, when the agency took a hardline stance, there wasn’t much backlash. In fact, many bystanders even sided with them.

This time, Sebastian found himself in hot water—after all, it was his fan who had caused the incident.

Many of Sebastian’s fans had been present that night, yet not only had he failed to explain the situation, but he also hadn’t addressed the embarrassment caused by his own supporters.

They didn’t blame Evelyn or Julian. Even if they were biased toward their idol, they knew this mess had nothing to do with Team A-List.

It was all Sebastian’s fault.

His fans were furious. Fan sites shut down, and fan leaders threatened to withdraw support unless Sebastian stepped forward with an explanation.

Finally, Sebastian posted a live stream announcement on Twitter. Both Adrian and Seraphina shared it, announcing that the trio would clarify everything during the broadcast.

By then, Evelyn and the others had already returned home. No sooner had she flopped onto the couch than she saw the live stream notification. Just as she was about to tune in, a message from Margaret popped up.

Meanwhile, Nathan found himself in a predicament. With his arm in a sling, he needed help with undressing and bathing—but the butler was mysteriously absent.

Resigned, he called his father.

"My back hurts. I need to rest. Ask your wife for help."

Julian had gone to find a doctor, leaving only young Theodore to assist—but before they could even reach him, there was a knock at the door.

Evelyn stood awkwardly in the doorway, phone in hand. "Mom sent me to help you," she said.

I definitely didn’t come here because I heard I could help Nathan undress and bathe! Nope, not at all! This is purely about repaying a favor!

Nathan nearly choked on air at her thoughts.

Inside the bathroom, the shower was already running. Nathan’s injured right arm was wrapped tightly in cling film, and his expensive shirt had been cut open at the sleeve during treatment—making Evelyn’s job easier.

Layer by layer, his clothes came off, revealing a physique that belonged on the cover of a fitness magazine. A tiny smirk tugged at Evelyn’s lips.

Is this a blessing in disguise? Well, a blessing for me, but a misfortune for him. Oh my, am I terrible for thinking this? Hehehe!

Leaning against the sink, Nathan kept his gaze lowered, his ears burning red from Evelyn’s relentless mental commentary.

Outwardly, she maintained a professional demeanor. Inwardly? She was whistling.

Everyone’s a critic at heart.

This collarbone… this Adam’s apple…

Would kneeling on those abs hurt my knees? And that V-line… Oh, if only I could—

Nathan shuddered, his entire body tensing. An involuntary image of Evelyn doing exactly that flashed in his mind. He was losing his sanity.

Embarrassed and irritated, he looked up to warn her—but their eyes never met.

The steam clung to his golden skin, highlighting every perfect contour. Broad shoulders, narrow waist—oh my.

Nathan wondered, Am I numb? Completely numb? We’re married, right? This isn’t some strange first encounter?

Does anyone understand how awkward this is? I should film this and send it to my besties—they’d lose their minds!

Next is… Oh dear. Should I peek? I’ve never seen one before. No, no, no—that’s too weird!

Hmm… Fair. We’re only a couple on paper—no way he’d strip fully in front of me. Wait, he looks nervous. Should I tease him? Maybe "accidentally" cause a little chaos? Hahaha! I’m evil!

Face flushed, Nathan stood abruptly, feigning composure. "Aren’t you supposed to be watching the live stream?" he said, voice slightly hoarse. "You’ll miss the drama."

Oh right! The gossip! How could I forget? Has it started yet? It must have!

In a flash, Evelyn abandoned the handsome man in the bathroom. "Don’t get the wound wet!" she called over her shoulder. "I’ll be outside if you need me!"

Then she vanished like the wind.

Nathan stared at the closed door, torn between relief (she hadn’t seen everything) and exasperation (his wife cared more about gossip than him).

What he didn’t know? A group of people were eavesdropping outside.

They were deeply invested in what was happening inside, but the thick door muffled everything.

Just as they debated whether Evelyn had started helping Nathan bathe, her mental scream echoed:

Start from the beginning! What did they say at the start of the live stream? Let me check! Wait—they actually apologized together? Admitted they chose the script? And those rumors were fake? Wow, burning bridges much? Sebastian and Seraphina used to date? Seriously?

The Blackwoods froze.

Live stream?

One by one, they pulled out their phones, found seats, and tuned in.

My family’s happiness? I’ll worry about that later!

###Chapter 109 - The Harmonious Trio

The first part of the live broadcast went smoothly enough, considering the script selection debacle. No one could pinpoint who was responsible for the leaks, so they brushed it off as a misunderstanding—at least on the surface.

Sebastian, ever the opportunist, played the humble card, taking full blame. He claimed he lacked confidence against Team A-list and chose what he knew best, admitting his oversight was entirely his fault.

Truthfully, this could have resolved everything from the start. But Sebastian was too proud to admit defeat—too ashamed to acknowledge failure. Rather than tarnish his own reputation, he’d happily let others take the fall.

Yet here he was, forced to confess. With their relationship about to go public, blaming his agent, Isabelle, would make him look like a fool. So, he scrapped his original plan and started fresh.

Evelyn couldn’t help but smirk whenever she thought about it—Sebastian’s grand schemes crumbling to dust, and Isabelle getting tossed aside without a second thought.

Then came the joint live broadcast with Adrian and Seraphina, where they announced their united front, vowing to face the consequences together. A touching display of solidarity—or so they wanted everyone to believe.

Evelyn nearly choked on her laughter.

The audience, however, was baffled.

Not just Evelyn—the entire internet, mere spectators, had never witnessed such audacious maneuvering. It was enough to leave everyone speechless.

The scene unfolded with the three of them hosting together—Sebastian seated center stage, flanked by Adrian and Seraphina.

Netizen: Can someone explain why you three are suddenly besties?

Netizen: Adrian, blink twice if you’re being held hostage. Don’t let those two snakes beside you fool you.

Netizen: Sebastian, why are you in the middle? Trying to show us what a third wheel looks like in real time?

Netizen: Are affairs just… openly accepted now?

Netizen: No, no, our Seb didn’t come to break up this happy home—he came to join it.

Netizen: Honestly? As long as you three are happy. I don’t get it, but I respect the chaos.

Netizen: I am so confused right now.

Evelyn burst out laughing, her melodic "hahaha" echoing through the penthouse.

Nathan, struggling with his shirt in the bathroom, paused at the sound.

The Blackwood family, eavesdropping from the living room, erupted into fits of laughter.

This generation of netizens had no filter—zero regard for the feelings of fans or the so-called "main characters."

Meanwhile, the fans were losing it.

Fan: Sebastian, speak up! Did you betray your friends to steal their girlfriends?

Fan: Adrian, DUMP HER ALREADY!

Fan: Seraphina, tell us you’re not playing both sides!

Unfazed, the trio ignored the comments and dropped their bombshells.

Adrian went first. "I planned to announce this after the show, but things escalated. The truth is, Seraphina and I broke up amicably a while ago. We’re just friends now."

The chat exploded.

Fan: Are you kidding me? You two were all over each other at events last month!

Fan: Entertainment industry politics, folks. No permanent enemies, only permanent interests.

Fan: Or maybe they did break up but had to fake it for contracts.

Fan: Poor Adrian, swallowing his pride to protect his ex.

Fan: *Please, Adrian’s a known playboy. For all we know, Seraphina dumped him.

Before the chaos settled, Seraphina chimed in.

"Adrian and I really are over. As for Sebastian… we actually dated five years ago when we were rookies. Misunderstandings tore us apart, but this collaboration cleared things up. So… we’re giving it another shot."

Adrian smiled, playing the magnanimous ex. "Even though we’re not together, I want her to be happy. Turns out, Sebastian and I work well together, and I helped patch things up between them. Guess I played matchmaker."

The fans were livid.

They’d defended their idols tirelessly, fought online battles, even gotten into legal trouble over rumors—only to find out their idols had already moved on.

Evelyn snorted. "Adrian, how do you say that with a straight face? Out of all the lies you three spun, yours is the funniest."

Still, this was better than the original malicious scheme. At least they hadn’t dragged Isabelle through the mud.

Most of the backlash would blow over eventually. Some fans would leave, but the damage was contained.

Sebastian was mid-speech when the bathroom door clicked open.

Evelyn turned—and froze.

Nathan stood there, hair damp, steam curling off his skin like mist over marble. His eyes, dark and piercing, locked onto hers.

A towel draped over his broad shoulders, he wore black silk pajama pants, one arm lazily tucked into a matching robe.

Fresh from the shower, his skin glowed like polished jade—flawless, sculpted, dangerously tempting.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Men fresh out of the shower are lethal.

Nathan arched a brow.

"You’re done? Why didn’t you call me?" She sprang up, snatching his clothes. "Here, let me help."

She fumbled with the robe, fingers brushing taut muscle. Every accidental touch sent sparks up her spine.

Nathan watched, amused, as she circled him like a nervous stylist.

Then—Sebastian’s voice cut through the live feed.

"One more announcement. Due to creative differences, my agent Isabelle and I have officially parted ways."

Evelyn’s hands stilled.

Nathan’s robe hung half-open, but she barely noticed. She dropped back onto the couch, eyes glued to the screen.

What now? I thought we were done with Isabelle.

With a sigh, Nathan grabbed a towel, ruffled his hair dry, and joined her.

The drama wasn’t over yet.
###Chapter 110 - You've Truly Mastered the Art of Profit

The latest bombshell sent fans into a frenzy.



Sebastian Hart and his manager terminated their contract? They parted ways? What was the real reason behind this sudden split?

Speculations ran wild within minutes.

Sebastian, scrolling through the comments, addressed the burning questions with practiced ease.

"This has nothing to do with the stage play. I’ve said it before—those rumors are baseless. The script was entirely my vision. The gossip about an affair with my manager? Completely fabricated. We were never romantically involved, only professional colleagues."

Evelyn Sinclair blinked in confusion at the screen.

Sebastian’s tone shifted abruptly, his voice hardening as if speaking directly to someone unseen.

"I know you're watching this live. I’m grateful for your guidance all these years. Much of my success is because of you. But I regret disappointing your expectations. Even though you doubted us from the start, wishing we’d break up—I’ll prove our love is real. Our relationship won’t hold me back. This time, no one will tear us apart. Ever again."

With that declaration, he clasped Seraphina Delacroix’s hand and raised it high.

"Something’s off," Evelyn muttered, frowning.

Nathan Blackwood leaned back, arms crossed. "Half-truths are the most dangerous. Isabelle Laurent wasn’t involved in their recent breakup and reunion, but she did play a role in their split five years ago. Sebastian hinted at her interference but dodged the real issue. Yet every word he said was technically true. Isabelle can’t deny it—and this strategy just swayed public sympathy in their favor."

Evelyn turned to him, baffled. "Why go through all this trouble?"

Nathan’s lips quirked. "Their initial plan was ethically shaky. To fix it, they had to paint Isabelle as the villain. But that risked backlash—accusations of ingratitude, or worse, Isabelle retaliating with proof of their lies. So instead, they let the audience imagine the worst. After all, Adrian Cross—the real snake here—would never admit to stealing someone’s girlfriend. And Seraphina would never confess her vanity caused their breakup."

He gestured to the live chat, where comments exploded after a brief pause.

Fan1: Wait… is there a hidden meaning here?
Fan2: Did they just imply their breakup five years ago was because of someone’s meddling?
Fan3: Was it the manager who wanted them apart?
Fan4: Just because she wasn’t in love with him doesn’t mean she didn’t want him for herself! No wonder she retreated once they reunited—her plan failed!
Fan5: Oh my god, they’ve been suffering all this time!
Fan6: So Adrian, the justice-bringer, exposed the manager’s scheme and helped them reconcile? Is that why the contract ended so abruptly?
Fan7: The truth is out. My mind is blown.

Nathan smirked. "Isabelle won’t recover from this."

And she wouldn’t. The only way Isabelle could defend herself was if Sebastian and Seraphina outright slandered her with lies. She had evidence ready—proof of her professionalism, her dedication, her lack of inappropriate actions. She’d even considered exposing Adrian and Seraphina’s affair. But in this game, she wasn’t the only player with brains.

The old saying rang true: Three rumors make a tiger. No matter what Isabelle said now, she’d be drowned in skepticism. If she dared mention Adrian’s role, she’d only be labeled a bitter liar.

The smart move? Stay silent. Ignore the storm. Respond politely to Sebastian’s vague accusations.

But pride burned in her throat.

Yet… she had no choice.

Hours later, Isabelle’s Twitter response went live:

"As a manager, I discouraged artist relationships. Back then, I was young and rigid. Now that you’ve reunited, I wish you happiness. Thank you for your hard work—it contributed to my career too."

Comments were disabled.

She knew what awaited her online. The conspiracy theories were already spreading.

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, who stood beside him sipping warm milk, her brow furrowed. "She’s handling it well. Professional to the end. But don’t worry—since Julian and I chose her as your agent, we’ll—"

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A slow, mischievous grin curled her lips.

"I tried to let things go. Really. But if they’re begging for chaos…"

Nathan raised an eyebrow as she pulled up her laptop, typed furiously, and uploaded two video files.

Video 1: The balcony confrontation. Timeline inconsistencies. A very passionate kiss. Proof Isabelle only suggested the breakup—never forced it.

Video 2: Backstage today. The contract termination. Sebastian’s narcissism on full display. Isabelle’s quiet devastation.

Evelyn cackled. "Tomorrow’s headlines will be glorious."

Nathan chuckled. "They’re celebrating at Sebastian’s place right now. Drinking to their ‘victory.’"

"Let them enjoy their last happy night," Evelyn purred, sipping her milk. Then she paused.

Wait.

Nathan had poured this for her.

Her cheeks warmed. He was the injured one—she should be taking care of him. And how did he even know she drank warm milk before bed?

She peeked at him. He was watching the videos, utterly engrossed.

"You caught everything perfectly," he murmured.

Evelyn bit her lip. "Consider this payback. If they hadn’t messed with you, none of this would’ve happened. It’s their fault!"

Nathan turned. His gaze softened, warmth flickering in his eyes. "Thank you for avenging me."

 Novel

###Chapter 111: My Home Isn't a Trash Compactor

Isabelle Laurent was the type who'd choke on her own pride before letting a single tear fall—no one would ever catch her vulnerable.

She barricaded herself in her apartment, silencing every notification, waiting for the storm of the night to pass.

She’d lost this round, but surrender wasn’t in her vocabulary. One day, she’d make them regret crossing her.

After a sleepless night, dawn crept in. She swiped on her makeup, unlocked her phone, and braced herself for the fallout at work.

The second her screen lit up, it exploded with messages.

Isabelle scoffed. Probably another obsessive fan of Sebastian Hart, somehow timing their call the moment she powered on.

But no—it was the agency.

A Twitter alert blazed across her screen:

"SCANDAL: The Twisted Love Triangle That Will Shock You"

Isabelle had become the sacrificial lamb.

Was last night’s livestream just a ploy to sic fans on the manager and shift blame?

Two-faced Sebastian, cuckold king Adrian Cross, and Seraphina Delacroix—queen of mixed signals.

The whiplash of the trending topic left her stunned. She tapped into Twitter, only to find the platform ablaze with explosive headlines.

At 7:30 AM, right as rush hour kicked off, two gossip accounts had dropped bombshell videos—leveraging last night’s drama to set the internet on fire.

Isabelle’s grip tightened on her ringing phone. The agency’s VP roared through the speaker—this scandal had torpedoed three of their biggest cash cows.

"Isabelle, did you orchestrate this?"

Her laugh was ice. "If I had that kind of power, I wouldn’t have waited until morning."

"Just get to Sebastian’s place. We can’t reach him—you two need damage control."

She polished her car keys with deliberate slowness. "Our contract’s terminated. His mess isn’t my problem."

"You—you built his career! How can you be so ruthless?"

"Oh, absolutely. I’m the villain here," she drawled.

A pause. "...At least delete last night’s post."

Isabelle’s smirk sharpened. "My account, my rules. And no—I’m keeping it up."

She’d been framed. Erasing evidence? Not a chance.

Let those fans marinate in their idol’s betrayal.

Not only did she leave the post live—she enabled comments.

If she didn’t fan the flames now, she’d be failing everyone who’d stood by her.

The only allies she could think of? Team A-list. She grabbed her bag, professionalism armor-clicking into place, and headed for Julian Blackwood’s agency.

Despite the early hour, the internet was a warzone.

Netizen 1: So Seraphina was locking lips with Sebastian, playing star-crossed lovers, then swapping spit with Adrian, claiming he’s her soulmate? This is a "peaceful breakup"?

Netizen 2: I’m officially lost. This trio’s dynamic is a psychological thriller.

Netizen 3: Wait—so when Seraphina dumped Sebastian, she was "forced"? But why—

Netizen 4: Too scared to piss off the real puppetmaster. Classic bully—picks on the weak. I knew the manager was right. What agent lets their rising star date?

Netizen 5: The script blame was a setup?! Never judge a saint by their halo, folks.

Netizen 6: Isabelle tried sparing us from that cringe-fest on stage. Too bad we saw Sebastian and Seraphina’s soap opera anyway.

Netizen 7: Thank god she got free. That movie’s crowded enough.

Netizen 8: I was mid-rant against the agent when this dropped. My draft is ashes.

Netizen 9: I RECOMMENDED THEM TO MY BOOK CLUB. My credibility is DEAD.

Meanwhile, Seraphina—passed out in the guest room—jolted awake to chaos.

Her head throbbed. The bed was empty. Relief.

Then the noise registered. She stumbled to the door, desperate to muffle the commotion before Sebastian woke upstairs.

Peephole check. She yanked the door open. "Do you know what time it is?!"

Her assistant shoved a phone at her. "Mira—emergency!"

Two familiar videos. Trending tags. Comments like knives:

Netizen 10: My "humble, hardworking" idol? A fraud.

Netizen 11: Cheater. Manipulator. Adrian’s just her backup plan.

Netizen 12: All three should be blacklisted. They’re a moral hazard.

Seraphina’s hands shook. "This can’t be happening—"

Worse? She’d slandered Terrence in that footage.

If he saw this…

She bolted upstairs, the entourage scrambling after her. "Sebastian! Disaster!"

Breakfast Table Intel:

The Blackwood family was mid-bite when Evelyn Sinclair suddenly choked on her orange juice.

Nathan Blackwood arched a brow. "Darling, did the scandal break before your coffee?"

She wiped her mouth, grinning. "Oh, it’s better than caffeine."

Across town, the trash fire raged on.
###Chapter 112: More Scandalous Revelations


The entire Blackwood family turned their attention to Evelyn, who stood frozen, her mind clearly racing to process the shocking information she'd just uncovered.

What could possibly be so scandalous that even Evelyn—who thrived on Hollywood's juiciest secrets—was left speechless? The suspense was killing them.

Finally, Sophia couldn't take it anymore. "So? What's the latest on those three?"

The question snapped Evelyn out of her daze.

This world is insane. Who knew a hospital could be such a hotbed of drama?

The Blackwoods held their breath. Out with it already!

Oh, this is too good not to share!

Margaret thought, Just say it out loud, for heaven's sake!

Turns out, after last night's wild reconciliation party, Sebastian and Seraphina—drunk and nostalgic—retreated to their room to "rekindle their passion."

Julian rolled his eyes. "Not surprising. They did just get back together."

But then, Seraphina received a text. Adrian hadn't left. She rushed out, only to find him lingering in the hallway, looking conflicted. Before she could speak, he swept her into his arms and carried her to the guest room, where they—

The Blackwoods collectively groaned. These three are a mess.

Later, after Seraphina passed out, Adrian had an epiphany: he didn’t just admire Sebastian—he wanted him. No wonder he'd been so obsessed with the rumors.

Nathan’s expression darkened. Do I even want to hear the rest?

Then Adrian barged into Sebastian’s room…

The Blackwoods gasped.

No. Way.

Julian, usually unshakable, looked horrified. He’d suspected Adrian had ulterior motives, but this?

Sebastian, half-conscious from the alcohol, woke up just in time to realize what was happening. Chaos erupted—fists flew, furniture shattered. Both men ended up unconscious, half-dressed, with suspicious marks on Sebastian’s neck.

And who walked in at that exact moment?

Seraphina.

With four people in tow.

Silence fell over the Blackwood breakfast table.

Meanwhile, Sebastian’s bedroom echoed with screams. Seraphina collapsed against the door, gagging. The others shouted, trying to rouse the two men, but their swollen faces and bloodied lips told the whole story.

Cue the ambulance.

I never saw this twist coming, Evelyn mused. Sebastian’s already humiliated, and now Terrence is spilling secrets? Once he finds out how Seraphina betrayed him back then… yikes. Remember his speech last night? What a joke.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Sebastian was done for.

By now, they’d lost their appetites.

Richard cleared his throat. "Nathan, take the day off. Let that injury heal."

Nathan nodded.

Margaret added, "We should get your bandages changed at the hospital later."

Another nod.

Sophia opened her mouth—"I’ll go with—" but Margaret shot her a look. She quickly corrected herself, grinning at Evelyn. "Oh! That’s why you woke up early, Evie. You’re going with Nathan, right?"

Evelyn nodded.

He got hurt because of me. Least I can do is help.

Nathan’s lips twitched.

Also, he’s my cash cow. Gotta keep him happy.

His smile vanished.

The Blackwoods stifled laughter.

At the hospital, after Nathan’s check-up, reporters suddenly swarmed the building.

Evelyn’s first thought: Did my disguise fail?

But then—

"Celebrity sighting?" Nathan murmured, glancing at her pointedly.

Evelyn’s eyes widened.

Wait… is this the same hospital? Are they here about the Terrence scandal?

Karma’s a bitch, huh?

"Should we… take a peek?" Nathan suggested.

Meanwhile, in Room 407—

Sebastian’s face drained of color as he read Terrence’s explosive post:

"Want the truth? Seraphina sold you out years ago. Half a million to sabotage your audition. And that ‘accident’ that ruined your career? She paid me to do it. Bank records don’t lie."

The online world erupted.

Sebastian’s hands shook. His gaze locked onto Seraphina, who backed away, trembling.

Adrian smirked. "She’s trash, Sebastian."

With a roar, Sebastian lunged, choking her. "You ruined me!"

Seraphina screamed, breaking free just as—

Click. The door flew open.

Dozens of cameras flashed.

"Sebastian! Are you with Seraphina or Adrian?" a reporter shouted.

Chaos erupted—again.

Evelyn sighed. Best. Hospital trip. Ever.

###Chapter 113 - Beyond Even The Wildest Romance Novels

Nathan's grip tightened around Evelyn's waist as he effortlessly lifted her, giving her a perfect view over the crowd. The VIP ward corridor was in chaos—reporters shouting, camera flashes blinding, medical staff scrambling to control the situation.

"Look at that!" Evelyn gasped, her eyes widening as she caught sight of the two figures tangled together on the hospital bed.

Sebastian Hart and Adrian Cross—once the golden couple of Hollywood's rumor mill—were now the center of a scandal so outrageous it could've been ripped straight from a steamy fanfiction.

Nathan's lips twitched as he listened to Evelyn's internal cackling. This is even better than I imagined!

The whispers around them grew louder.

"Did you hear? The ambulance crew said when they picked them up, their clothes were—"

"Someone leaked the proctologist appointment! Can you believe it?"

"Honestly, I always thought Adrian had that look in his eyes whenever he glanced at Sebastian."

Evelyn bit her lip to stifle a laugh. The Gossip System had already fed her the truth, but hearing it play out in real time was pure gold.

Nathan scoffed. "Without Isabelle Laurent keeping things under wraps, Sebastian's reputation is done for."

Evelyn nodded gleefully. "Karma’s a bitch, and she’s working overtime today."

Just then, a reporter’s voice cut through the noise.

"Sebastian, is it true you and Adrian used Seraphina as a cover for your relationship?"

Sebastian’s face twisted in horror as he shoved Adrian away. "What the hell are you talking about?!"

But the damage was done. The cameras had already captured the damning evidence—Adrian clinging to Sebastian like a lovesick fool.

Evelyn grinned. "Oh, this is delicious."

Nathan arched a brow. "You’re enjoying this a little too much."

"Are you kidding? This is the best entertainment I’ve had in months!"

Online, the scandal had already exploded.

#SebastianHartProctologyVisit was trending.

#AdrianCrossSecretLover had over a million tweets.

And someone had even started a poll:

"Which pairing do you ship?"

Evelyn tapped her screen without hesitation.

Nathan peered over her shoulder. "You voted for them?"

She smirked. "What? They’re the underdogs."

Nathan shook his head, amused. "You’re ruthless."

Inside the ward, chaos escalated.

Sebastian lunged at Adrian. "You ruined me, you sick bastard!"

Seraphina, who had been trying to slip away unnoticed, shrieked as Sebastian turned on her next. "And you! This is all your fault!"

Security finally intervened, but not before the reporters got their shots—bruises, torn clothes, and all.

Evelyn sighed happily. "And just last night, they were playing happy family."

Nathan smirked. "Nothing brings people together like mutual destruction."

As they walked away, Evelyn glanced back one last time.

Sebastian’s career was in flames.

Adrian’s reputation was shredded.

And Seraphina? Well, she’d finally gotten the spotlight she craved—just not the way she wanted.

Evelyn grinned. "Best. Day. Ever."

Nathan chuckled. "You’re terrifying."

She winked. "You love it."

And with that, they left the hospital, the echoes of scandal ringing behind them.

###Chapter 114: Isabelle's Ultimate Betrayal


Nathan's cryptic words left Evelyn momentarily puzzled. She wanted to press for details, but he merely shrugged. "Just a theory. Either way, this path has its advantages. Let's see what the others choose."

The poll intrigued Evelyn. Honestly, she believed the trio would inevitably go their separate ways.

As Evelyn and Nathan prepared to leave the hospital, their lawyer called. The fan who'd attacked them had confessed.

Online backlash had reached a tipping point. Fans could no longer defend the scandal-ridden trio. Their reputations lay in ruins.

Fan clubs emptied overnight. Supporters felt their devotion had been mocked. Not a single positive comment remained.

The scandals were too outrageous. Even the most loyal fans felt like fools, their blind devotion shattered.

The imprisoned young girl broke down when her lawyer showed her the truth via phone. She cursed Sebastian Hart through tears before falling silent, utterly drained.

Her parents, who'd planned to guilt-trip Evelyn and Julian, discovered their formidable backgrounds and backed off. When they tried manipulating Sebastian, they found him equally powerless. Defeated, they accepted legal consequences.

After resolving the girl's case, Evelyn and Nathan were summoned to the agency by Julian.

Upon arrival, they found Marcus had already finalized Isabelle Laurent's contract.

Spotting Evelyn, Isabelle stood and bowed deeply. "Thank you for your assistance, Ms. Sinclair. I owe you."

Evelyn waved dismissively. "I just came for the drama. Don't mention it."

As they spoke, Isabelle's phone buzzed again.

Marcus smirked. "Answer it. Some people need to hear rejection directly."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow as Julian explained, "It's Sebastian. He keeps calling from different numbers."

"Still?" Evelyn gasped dramatically. "Is he begging you to take him back?"

Isabelle sighed. If not for professional obligations, she'd have turned her phone off hours ago.

Under Evelyn's intense gaze, Isabelle answered—on speakerphone.

"Dani, please..." Sebastian's voice cracked with desperation, clearly destroyed by the past twelve hours. He was reaching for his most trusted lifeline.

"I believe our contract terminated already, Mr. Hart," Isabelle replied icily. "Cease this harassment."

"Dani, I was wrong! Seraphina deceived me! Let's restart—you set the terms! The company's abandoning me! My career—"

"Forgotten how you treated me?" Isabelle cut in ruthlessly. "Why would I help the man who betrayed me? You're worthless now. Did you think I'd salvage trash?"

Evelyn bit her lip to stifle laughter. Others weren't as successful.

Sebastian's breathing hitched. He hadn't expected such public humiliation.

After several shaky breaths, he tried again. "We built everything together! I treated you well back then! One mistake—"

"You broke our vows first," Isabelle spat. "Your groveling disgusts me."

Sebastian's fragile patience snapped. "You think you'll succeed without me? A nobody like you? I'll ruin your reputation! See who hires you then!"

Evelyn's eyes widened. So it was scorched-earth tactics now? Shamelessness truly knew no bounds.

Isabelle remained calm. "By the way, I recorded this call."

A beat of silence. Then Sebastian's voice turned shrill. "You wouldn't—"

"I would." She hung up.

Isabelle signed the contract without noticing Marcus and Julian's exchanged grins.

Finally tricked one in.

Her enthusiasm lasted until she realized the catch:

She was agency head—because Marcus and Julian were leaving.
She did control the artists—all one of them: Evelyn, who worked only when inspired.
The Blackwood Group backing? Contingent on Evelyn and Nathan's relationship stability.
Marcus and Julian began tiptoeing around her.

Finally, Isabelle cornered them. "Before you flee, we're recruiting."

Marcus brightened. "Any targets?"

Isabelle smirked. "How many My Acting Skill episodes remain?"

Marcus frowned. "The leftovers are problematic."

"Controversy breeds buzz," Isabelle countered. "I'll assess them myself. No room for incompetence or ingrates."

Julian shrugged. "Your call."

Marcus added, "Announce your hiring on Twitter."

Isabelle laughed. "Why? Has Sebastian made news?"

Marcus rotated his laptop, revealing trending topics:

🔥 Seraphina's Love Triangle with Her Gay Exes
💔 Adrian & Sebastian's Doomed Romance
🎭 How Seraphina's Cover-Up Backfired

Isabelle's lips curved. Perfect timing.

###Chapter 115: The Gossip Queen Who Blacklists

Scrolling through trending topics on her phone, Evelyn Sinclair couldn't believe the chaos unfolding between the two sides—each hurling accusations without a shred of concrete evidence. The sheer absurdity of it all baffled her.

But then again, the poll results had spoken.

After Adrian Cross’s explosive revelation, Seraphina Delacroix had no way to salvage her reputation. With her bridges burned with Sebastian Hart and Adrian, she resorted to painting herself as the victim, using the swirling rumors about the other two as her shield.

Seraphina’s latest tweet read: "I was just emotionally torn between them, unable to let go of either. I’m just a girl who wanted love, afraid of being alone. But I never imagined they were using me as their cover this whole time! I respect all orientations, but I refuse to be a gay man’s beard."

Classic Seraphina. Her strategy always worked—some fans would buy into her victim narrative, convinced they’d uncovered the "truth." And, of course, the self-righteous defenders of morality would blindly rally behind her.

What she hadn’t anticipated, though, was Adrian and Sebastian teaming up. They’d found a way to twist the narrative, dragging her down with them in a spectacular mutual destruction.

Their joint video statement dropped like a bomb.

First, they issued a sincere apology for their past scheming against Isabelle Laurent, admitting they’d been blinded by ambition and acted immorally.

As for their tangled relationship, Adrian confessed he’d been the first to realize his feelings for Sebastian went beyond mere admiration. The realization had been agonizing, especially since he believed Sebastian was still in love with Seraphina. So, he broke up with her, willing to step aside for their happiness.

But then—plot twist—Sebastian fell for Adrian instead.

Fearing public scrutiny, they’d enlisted Seraphina, their close friend, to act as their cover. They knew it was unfair, so they promised her future resources in exchange. She agreed.

Thus began their carefully crafted façade—the picture-perfect trio. If they were ever caught being intimate, it wouldn’t raise eyebrows. Seraphina was their smokescreen.

What they hadn’t counted on? Her greed. She’d turned on them to save herself.

The "intimate" photos leaked to the press? Staged. Otherwise, the paparazzi would’ve caught her sleeping alone in the guest room downstairs.

Evelyn nearly choked on her latte. "They actually went with this angle? Bold. But does anyone actually buy this?"

The internet was divided. Some called it a masterstroke of PR spin; others declared it the most ridiculous plot twist of the year.

"Why would Sebastian agree to this? He nearly got assaulted! He beat Adrian into the hospital! And now they’re… holding hands?"

The video showed Adrian leaning into Sebastian, their fingers tightly intertwined. Sebastian’s expression was unreadable—but there was a hint of something soft in his eyes.

"Damn," Evelyn muttered. "Isabelle really knows how to pick actors. He’s selling this."

A sudden cough snapped her back to reality.

She turned to Nathan Blackwood, who sat at his desk, watching her with an amused yet exasperated look.

"What?" she asked.

They were in his CEO office—because, of course, the workaholic had only taken three days off before returning.

The Blackwood family had been insistent that he needed assistance, given his injured arm. Evelyn, currently on a break from her agency, had reluctantly stepped in as his temporary assistant.

Nathan had been surprisingly considerate, adjusting his schedule so they didn’t leave for the office until nine.

But in reality? Evelyn spent 90% of her time scrolling gossip sites while perched in the chair beside his desk.

She’d been quiet—until now.

Assuming he wanted something, she asked, "Thirsty? Should I ask Lillian to bring water?"

Nathan gave her a look. He’d grown used to her mental commentary, but the sudden burst of emotions still distracted him.

"Hmm. Black coffee. Need to focus," he said.

Evelyn called in the order—black coffee for him, a latte for herself.

As he took a break, she couldn’t resist. "How did you predict this mess so accurately?"

She’d forwarded the poll to the rest of the Blackwoods, but she was the only one who’d guessed right.

Nathan’s eyes flickered. So that’s what the family group chat had been buzzing about. He’d skimmed it earlier, seen the drama, and ignored it.

Had they all participated in the poll?

Of course. Everyone else had free time. Only he was stuck working.

The resentment simmered.

"Simple cost-benefit analysis," he explained. "Sebastian was cornered. The rumors were inescapable, and his reputation was tanking. The smartest move? Spin it into something even more sensational. In this industry, truth doesn’t matter—only the juicier story does."

Evelyn smirked. "Adrian’s playing along, though. He knows what’s happening, and he’s letting himself be used. No—he’s volunteering."

This was a battle between obsessive, unhinged Adrian and cunning, ruthless Sebastian.

"Who wins first? Crazy Adrian melting Sebastian’s icy heart, or Sebastian bleeding Adrian dry?" The thought was deliciously thrilling.

She sipped her latte, scrolling through the chaos online.

Netizens were stunned. The most common reaction? "Team Duo Alpha just dethroned Team Young Again as the biggest joke of the month."

And then—the final twist.

Adrian and Sebastian announced their departure from My Acting Skill.

Same ending as Team Young Again.

Evelyn blinked. "Wait… so only three teams are left? They still have episodes to film. How’s that going to work?"

"Maybe… they’ll find replacements?" Nathan mused, equally unsure.

But the production team’s solution? A round-robin tournament. The remaining teams would face off in random matchups.

"That’s still not enough," Evelyn muttered, curiosity driving her to check the Gossip System.

What she found nearly made her spit out her drink.

Nathan raised a brow as her lips twitched.

"After the Duo Alpha disaster, the producers tried recruiting new teams. But guess what? No one’s biting. Even the desperate fame-seekers who begged to join before are ghosting them."

"Why?"

"They’re scared of clashing with Team A-List. Think the show’s cursed. Or—more likely—terrified their own skeletons will get exposed."

Evelyn scoffed. "Cowards."

Nathan smirked. Who would’ve thought the once-dominant show would become radioactive?

"Bet the producers are sobbing in a bathroom right now."

"Deserved," Nathan agreed.

Just then, Evelyn’s phone buzzed—a message from Marcus Donovan, asking her to retweet Isabelle’s post.

She’d been so engrossed in gossip she hadn’t noticed Isabelle had tagged her.

Isabelle’s tweet announced Evelyn as her official agent. Evelyn quickly reposted it.

With a million followers now, the comments flooded in instantly.

She refreshed, expecting Julian Blackwood’s usual congratulatory remark to top the list. But no—it was pushed to second place.

The top comment?

"Once you enter Evelyn’s fandom, there’s no escape. She’s the Gossip Queen—the one who blacklists. Come, let’s feast on the drama with her!"

Evelyn stared.

"What the hell?"

###Chapter 116: The Justice Enforcer Begins Her Mission


Could this get any more ridiculous? Gossip was one thing, but these absurd nicknames were crossing the line! First, she was dubbed "The Slapping Queen," then "The Censor," and now this?

Evelyn Sinclair was beyond exasperated. Fuming, she vented to her new manager, Isabelle Laurent.

Isabelle, ever the pragmatist, shot back, "This is golden publicity! Organic hype like this is priceless—pure positive exposure." To drive her point home, she even liked and replied to one of the trending comments.

Grumbling, Evelyn downed the rest of her iced latte in one go.

A quiet chuckle came from beside her.

Evelyn’s glare snapped toward the source.

Nathan Blackwood immediately feigned deep concentration on his tablet, as if he hadn’t made a sound.

"Really?"

Clearing his throat, Nathan reasoned, "Isabelle’s crafting an image for you. This reputation means no one will dare mess with you—or try shady deals. It’s strategic."

Evelyn blinked. "Wait, seriously?"

Nathan nodded. "She’s also leveraging this to solidify the agency’s credibility. Future artists under your label will inherit that trust, making fan acquisition and collaborations smoother. Win-win."

Evelyn pointed at herself incredulously. She wasn’t thrilled about being branded as some sort of industry vigilante.

After a pause, Nathan added, "If you’re uncomfortable, tell Isabelle directly. If she can’t adjust the narrative, I’ll step in."

"Can I really do that?"

"Of course. No one forces you into roles you dislike." His tone left no room for doubt.

Caught off guard by his firmness, Evelyn reconsidered.

Honestly, it was amusing—just not when she was the punchline.

By afternoon, the online frenzy took a surreal turn.

Fans of scandal-ridden celebrities began demanding their idols "prove their innocence" under Evelyn’s scrutiny. The audacity!

Predictably, those with skeletons in their closets turtled up, sparking a wave of hilarious exposes.

Evelyn spent hours cackling at her phone until Nathan, unable to focus, exiled her from his meeting.

"You’re distracting," he muttered, shoving files into her hands. "Organize these. And don’t touch my emails unless it’s urgent."

Left alone in his office, Evelyn humored herself with minor tasks—sorting contracts, typing notes, even handling Nathan’s messages.

Post the Victoria Hayes incident, Nathan had locked down his devices tighter than Fort Knox. Yet here Evelyn was, granted full access.

Oh, Victoria would combust if she knew.

Grinning, Evelyn tidied up—until an email notification popped up.

Unknown Sender:
"Nate, I’m returning in two weeks. Let’s meet?"

Her finger froze mid-click.

Cassandra. Nathan’s first love.

Evelyn recoiled like the email was radioactive. Why did I open this?!

Later, while ordering tea at the hotel lounge, Evelyn was recognized and offered a tab.

Then a voice purred behind her:

"Evelyn Sinclair. What a coincidence."

Five impeccably dressed women lounged nearby, jewels glinting, sipping tea with an air of bored superiority. The speaker—Ruth Aguilar, wife of veteran actor Gordon Gonzales—smirked from the center.

Their paths had barely crossed before, as Ruth was too busy policing her husband around Rebecca Yancey, the industry’s notorious "Cleopatra."

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled with mischief. She approached, polite but poised.

Ruth didn’t rise. "Ladies, meet Evelyn Jeannet."

The group offered frosty nods, clearly dismissing her as some director’s kept woman.

Oh, this is rich. Evelyn bit her lip. Without Julian Blackwood’s name attached, they assumed she was a nobody.

Just as she turned to leave, Ruth dropped the bomb:

"Sit. We need your help."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh?"

Ruth’s smile turned razor-sharp. "You’re the ‘Justice Enforcer,’ aren’t you? In the next episode, we want Rebecca destroyed. That homewrecker deserves ruin."

###Chapter 117: Plagued By Despicable Men

A faint twitch tugged at the corner of Evelyn Sinclair’s lips. She was beyond arguing about the ridiculous "Justice Upholder" nickname the internet had slapped on her.

I thought it was just a stupid online joke, but here’s the elegant Mrs. Holloway actually saying it with a straight face. How is she not embarrassed? I’m mortified enough for both of us.

Despite her internal screaming, Evelyn kept her expression perfectly composed. Little did she know, her silent rant had just been overheard by Margaret and Genevieve Blackwood, who had paused mid-step outside the lounge.

The two women, with far too much free time on their hands, had come to spy on how Nathan and Evelyn were getting along at the company. Finding them absent, they’d decided to rest in the lounge—only to stumble upon some juicy gossip.

Exchanging a glance, they quickly disguised themselves—oversized sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, anything to hide their faces—before slipping inside unnoticed. They settled into a secluded booth, ears perked.

"Mrs. Holloway, you must be joking," Evelyn said with a strained laugh.

Ruth Holloway’s sharp gaze pinned her. "Of course not. You handled the first two groups flawlessly. You’re a woman of principle, Ms. Sinclair. Surely you wouldn’t tolerate such shameless behavior?"

Truthfully, Ruth knew Team A-List would’ve gone after the homewrecker regardless—for clout, for revenge, whatever. But this time, she wanted Evelyn’s help to ensure the woman stayed buried.

"If you cooperate, we’ll handle everything," Ruth said, her tone dripping with authority.

Evelyn tilted her head. "And what exactly is your plan?"

Ruth’s lips thinned, displeased by Evelyn’s casual tone. "The face-off is decided by lot, but with our influence, the producers will pair your groups first. The topic? 'Women.'"

Her smile turned venomous. "We’ll expose that so-called 'close confidante' as nothing but a husband-stealing snake. No sugarcoating. She ruins families—let’s make sure the world sees it."

Margaret and Genevieve gasped. Were they really going this far?

"Weren’t Mrs. Holloway and Ms. Delacroix on good terms before?" Genevieve whispered. "What happened?"

Margaret frowned. "Something must’ve gone very wrong."

Their suspicions were confirmed when Ruth’s next words spilled out—her husband, Vincent Holloway, wanted a divorce for Rebecca Yancey.

Ah. So that’s the real issue.

Evelyn, meanwhile, was scrolling through her phone right in front of them, utterly unfazed. "Let me just… fact-check this drama real quick."

The wives bristled. How dare she ignore them?

But as Evelyn dug deeper, her amusement faded. The "evidence" against Rebecca? All of it pointed to Vincent being the predator—forcing himself on her, manipulating scenes, even tearing her clothes.

Damn. She’s not a seductress—she’s a victim.

Margaret and Genevieve, now also scrolling, shared horrified looks. The entertainment industry’s darkness was on full display—and these wives were blaming the wrong person.

Rebecca wasn’t the problem.

It was the despicable men—and the women who enabled them.


###Chapter 118: The Spotlight Belongs to Me

Evelyn Sinclair sat with Margaret and Genevieve, all three women sharing a silent understanding of Rebecca’s plight.



Yet, the online discourse surrounding Rebecca was nothing short of bewildering. Without realizing it, one could easily be swept into the same toxic narrative as the masses.

Men cracked crude jokes about Rebecca’s curves and sultry gaze. Eight out of ten comments dripped with suggestive humor, yet they insisted it wasn’t disrespect—just their way of appreciating her, as if she should be flattered.

They even picked fights with women defending Rebecca, pitting genders against each other. But this so-called protection felt suffocating.

The women were no better, split into two factions. One group, led by Ruth and her ilk, sneered at Rebecca as if they’d personally witnessed her seducing every man in sight. They clutched their pearls, terrified the harlot would sink her claws into their idols next. The other faction? Delusional mistresses who idolized Rebecca, seeing her as their twisted role model.

Only a rare few genuinely admired Rebecca’s beauty and undeniable talent.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. The internet, once a place of harmless fun, now felt like a battlefield.

No wonder only the ruthless survive this industry.

She had no interest in digging into others’ private lives. At most, she’d enjoy the drama from the sidelines.

So, she closed the tab.

When she looked up, the gaggle of society wives across from her still stared, waiting for her response.

Women should stand together. Yet some chose to side with the oppressors, betraying their own.

Pathetic.

“See now? You understand what kind of woman she is, don’t you?”

Evelyn nodded quickly. Oh, she understood perfectly.

Ruth mistook her agreement for compliance and puffed up with self-righteousness. “We must remove her—cleanse the industry of her filth!”

Evelyn tilted her head. “Aren’t you worried this might backfire on Mr. Gonzales? Last time we tried something like this… well, it didn’t end well.”

Ruth’s face twisted. “Of course not! I’ll make sure my husband sees her for the snake she is. She’s the seductress—my husband is just a victim of her schemes!”

Evelyn smirked. “A man willing to divorce you for another woman clearly doesn’t love you. And you still want him?”

Ruth’s lips thinned. “Our bond runs deeper than you could fathom. I won’t abandon him just because he’s lost his way. Now, focus on what we need from you.”

Evelyn leaned back, grinning. “I refuse.”

Silence.

Then—chaos.

“You dare reject us?”

“Who do you think you are? Some nobody who got lucky?”

“We should speak to your benefactor instead. You’re just a glorified sugar baby.”

Ruth’s eyes gleamed with malice. “Your man is high up in Quirk Group, isn’t he? My cousin sits on the board. I could have him put you in your place.”

Evelyn bit her lip to keep from laughing.

Across the room, Margaret and Genevieve trembled against the table, struggling to contain their amusement.

“Oh, so you didn’t approach Nathan because you knew you couldn’t control him?” Evelyn mused. “How… convenient.”

The wives exchanged uneasy glances.

One suddenly smirked. “You and Julian seemed awfully close on that show. Imagine if your boyfriend saw the footage…”

Evelyn blinked.

Oh, this is rich.

Margaret and Genevieve nearly collapsed from suppressed laughter.

Ruth lifted her phone. “Be smart, darling. My cousin could make things very difficult for you.”

Evelyn pressed her lips together, feigning distress.

What now?

She could drag in the waiter who knew her true identity. Or let Ruth call her cousin—every board member knew her. The shock would be delicious.

Margaret and Genevieve vibrated with excitement. They could reveal themselves, play the overbearing in-laws, put these women in their place—

The door burst open.

“Ruth? What are you doing here?”

Ruth’s head snapped up. “Liam! I—I came to see you.” She shot Evelyn a venomous smile. “Some girls these days have no respect. Maybe you could remind her benefactor to teach her some manners.”

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Showtime.

But Liam froze, paling.

“Mr. Blackwood? What—?”

Nathan Blackwood stood in the doorway, his presence commanding the room.

Ruth’s mind blanked.

The other wives whispered frantically, sensing the shift.

Nathan ignored them, stepping to Evelyn’s side. His hand settled on her shoulder, warm and possessive. “What happened?”

Evelyn looked up, pouting.

My grand moment—ruined!

She buried her face against his chest, fingers skimming the hard planes of his abs.

Mmm. Not complaining.

“Hubby,” she whimpered, “they threatened to replace me! Said I was just another sugar baby. And—and they slandered me with Julian!”

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

The wives gaped.

Ruth’s voice cracked. “Mr. Blackwood, she’s—?”

Nathan’s gaze turned glacial. “My fiancée.”

Silence.

Then—

Chaos.

No one steals Evelyn’s spotlight.

And no one threatens Nathan Blackwood’s woman.
###Chapter 119 Compromising Principles For Profit

"Honestly, ladies, doesn't this feel excruciatingly awkward? Aren't you mortified?"

Evelyn Sinclair continued her theatrics, tossing playful jabs while effortlessly maintaining her performance.



The room vibrated with Evelyn's exaggerated grievances—her feigned distress so transparent it bordered on satire. Yet, the effect was immediate. The clique of socialites and Liam stiffened as if a thundercloud had descended upon them.

The women exchanged panicked glances. She's not some kept mistress—she's the legitimate wife of Blackwood Group's heir! What kind of high-society wife abandons her gilded life to become a reality TV star?

Meanwhile, Liam internally groaned. Dragging me into this mess, implicating me in some fabricated scandal with my sister-in-law—cousin, what did I ever do to deserve this?

Nathan Blackwood knew Evelyn was merely entertaining herself, but he had no choice but to indulge her charade. His arm tightened around her waist, but when he lifted his gaze, his expression was glacial.

Though Evelyn could handle herself, Nathan wouldn’t tolerate disrespect toward his wife.

"My wife is young and prefers to avoid conflict," he stated, voice like tempered steel. "Yet you stormed into Blackwood Group to intimidate her. That constitutes harassment. Don’t you owe her an apology?"

His words carried an unspoken threat, leaving the room in suffocating silence.

Nathan delivered that perfectly—CEO energy at its finest. Ten out of ten.

Evelyn’s mental commentary nearly derailed Nathan’s composure. He exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose.

The socialites’ expressions were priceless—a cocktail of regret, humiliation, and sheer terror. They must be wishing the floor would swallow them whole.

Evelyn peeked at them, delighting in their discomfort.

Margaret and Genevieve, who had initially regretted not intervening, now watched the spectacle with vindictive amusement. Serves you right for throwing your weight around. Did you really think you could bully one of ours and walk away unscathed?

These women held influence in elite circles, but they’d just antagonized a Blackwood.

Minutes ago, they’d dared to threaten her. Now, the realization of their blunder made their blood run cold.

Their husbands relied on Blackwood investments. One wrong move, and their entire social standing could crumble.

Panic set in. The women scrambled to their feet, their demeanor shifting drastically.

"Mrs. Blackwood! Had we known it was you, we’d never have spoken so carelessly! We merely intended to mentor newcomers—a simple misunderstanding!"

"Please accept our sincerest apologies! Our earlier remarks were in poor taste—purely jest, of course!"

Their forced smiles couldn’t mask their desperation. The same women who’d sneered at Evelyn now groveled, their flattery as thick as syrup.

I almost miss their earlier arrogance. At least that was entertaining.

Evelyn’s attention, however, had already shifted.

"We deeply regret offending you, Mrs. Blackwood. These tokens are but a small gesture of our remorse. May they bring you joy."

Margaret and Genevieve exchanged stunned glances. The gifts laid out were expensive—clearly, these women were terrified of Blackwood retaliation.

Evelyn promptly released Nathan and zeroed in on the offerings.

Now this is more like it. Practicality over pride, always. A few insults in exchange for a fortune? Worth it. This haul must be worth millions. Cha-ching.

Nathan was speechless. He’d expected to defend her honor, only for her to fold—for money.

The socialites watched miserably as their prized possessions were claimed—items they’d barely enjoyed before surrendering them.

They came to teach a lesson and ended up learning one instead. Talk about poetic justice.

What infuriated them more was Ruth’s silence. She’d orchestrated this disaster, yet they were the ones paying the price.

Ruth, however, was struggling. Unlike the socialites, she wasn’t accustomed to swallowing her pride.

Under Liam’s insistent glare, she finally spoke—but her apology was laced with defiance.

"I misunderstood Ms. Sinclair’s identity earlier," she admitted stiffly. "But your wife’s behavior is still disappointing, Mr. Blackwood."

The room froze. Liam looked ready to strangle her.

"Ruth, enough. Apologize properly."

Ruth clenched her jaw. "I invited her to stand against a homewrecker. I admired her integrity—until she chose to defend the other woman. My harshness was meant to steer her right."

Liam’s gaze flicked to Evelyn, suspicion creeping in. Evelyn’s past reputation hadn’t been spotless.

She’s so desperate for allies against Rebecca that she’ll strong-arm anyone who disagrees. Too bad I don’t bend. Must be killing her.

Evelyn had planned a scathing retort—until Nathan cut in, his voice razor-sharp.

"Mrs. Gonzales, you projected your expectations onto my wife, then condemned her for not conforming. That’s not disappointment—that’s entitlement."

The tension thickened. Ruth had crossed a line, and Nathan wasn’t letting it slide.

Evelyn smirked. Game on.
###Chapter 120 - The Reckoning

The penthouse suite was eerily silent as Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her reflection a ghostly silhouette against the glittering Manhattan skyline. The city lights blurred through unshed tears as she clutched the damning photographs in her trembling hands.

Nathan Blackwood's betrayal burned hotter than the whiskey she'd thrown in his face an hour earlier.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Lillian Graves hovered in the doorway, clutching an iPad like a shield. "The press release is ready when you—"

"Change of plans." Evelyn's voice was steel wrapped in velvet. She turned, the photographs fluttering onto the marble counter like fallen leaves. "Cancel all my appointments. I'm going to London."

Lillian's gasp was audible. "But the shareholders meeting—"

"Can wait." Evelyn snatched her Givenchy coat from the chaise lounge. "Tell Preston Whitmore I want that private jet fueled in thirty minutes."

Downstairs in the lobby, Marcus Donovan materialized from the shadows near the elevators. "Evelyn." His hand caught her elbow. "Nathan's trying to reach you. He says—"

"Save it." She wrenched free, her Valentino heels clicking like gunshots across the polished floors. "His sister can explain why she's been funneling company funds to her husband's offshore accounts."

The paparazzi swarm outside the building erupted in flashes as Evelyn emerged. She ignored their shouted questions about "the Blackwood scandal" and slid into the waiting town car, where Serena Whitmore sat tapping furiously on her phone.

"Damage control?" Evelyn asked coldly.

Serena didn't look up. "Your Instagram followers just increased by 200k. The hashtag #TeamEvelyn is trending worldwide."

The car pulled away as Evelyn finally checked her phone. Seventeen missed calls from Nathan. Three from Julian Blackwood. And one... Her breath hitched. One from Beatrice Holloway at Columbia University.

The final piece of the puzzle.

Rain began streaking the windows as they sped toward Teterboro Airport. Somewhere over the Atlantic, Evelyn would decide whether to destroy the Blackwood empire—or save it.

But first, she needed answers from the one woman who knew all of Nathan's secrets: his first love, Cassandra.

The moment the words registered, Evelyn Sinclair froze, her face draining of color.

Without missing a beat, Nathan Blackwood shot them a sharp glare. "Ms. Sinclair has every right to live as she chooses. It's not for outsiders to dictate morality to her."

A chill ran down the directors' spines—Nathan's fury was unmistakable.

"Accusing Ms. Sinclair of defending a mistress could irreparably damage her reputation. We’ll be consulting our lawyers, Mrs. Bennett. You’d better have concrete proof to back your claims."

The final remark nearly made Claudia Bennett stumble, forcing the director beside her to steady her.

This wasn’t what she’d expected. She’d assumed that exposing Evelyn’s supposed defense of the other woman would at least prompt Nathan to question her motives. Instead, he’d turned the tables completely.

Worse, their responses mirrored each other perfectly. Just moments ago, Evelyn had demanded proof that Rebecca was the mistress.

From a distance, Genevieve gasped. "I’ve never heard Nathan speak so aggressively before."

Margaret Blackwood blinked, then burst into laughter.

"What’s so funny?" Genevieve asked, confused.

Margaret shook her head. "Nathan’s changed. Normally, he’d let Evelyn handle things herself—she’s more than capable. But this time? He didn’t hesitate to strike first."

Genevieve frowned. "Didn’t he always stand up for her?"

Margaret smirked but said nothing. Nathan had always protected his wife out of duty, but this? This was instinct.

Even Nathan’s ever-present assistant was stunned.

No sane person would dare argue now. Though Claudia seethed with resentment, she had no choice but to swallow her pride. In the end, the director had to step in, forcing her to issue a formal apology.

Nathan, however, remained unmoved. "If these rumors persist and harm Ms. Sinclair’s reputation, we will pursue legal action."

With that, he turned to Evelyn, who was staring at him with wide, expressive eyes—his reflection clear in their depths.

Then, to his bewilderment, her thoughts roared to life.

Damn it, he’s too smooth! That authoritative tone just wrecked me.

The ice in Nathan’s expression melted instantly, warmth flooding his cheeks.

What should’ve been a serious moment dissolved into awkward hilarity—because Evelyn, as always, had a knack for ruining the mood.

Nathan nudged her shoulder, prompting her to stand.

His assistant accepted the compensation from the other party—an unexpected windfall for Evelyn.

The rest of the onlookers stood frozen, too intimidated to move.

As they reached the exit, Nathan paused, glancing toward the VIP section. "Mother. Genevieve."

Margaret and Genevieve stiffened, realizing they’d been caught. Sheepishly, they removed their sunglasses and waved.

Evelyn’s jaw dropped. "You two were here the whole time?!"

The wives paled. They hadn’t noticed Margaret and Genevieve’s arrival—meaning they’d heard everything.

Being caught red-handed was far worse than being reported.

But before their panic could spiral, Margaret and Genevieve rushed forward, linking arms with Evelyn.

"When did you get here? Why didn’t you call me?"

"We were about to make a dramatic entrance, but someone stole our thunder!"

"Wait, you were planning to upstage me too?"

The trio dissolved into laughter, chatting animatedly while Nathan dutifully held doors open for them.

Meanwhile, Isabelle Laurent—freshly assigned to handle Evelyn’s files—received a call that made her eyebrows shoot up.

Back in Nathan’s office, the trio lounged on the couch, unwrapping apology gifts with childlike glee.

Nathan settled at his desk, accidentally waking his computer.

Evelyn, assuming he needed help, trotted over—then froze.

"Huh?"

Reply? To what? Does he not realize this is an email from his ex?

Margaret and Genevieve paused mid-unwrapping.

An ex? An email?

The Blackwoods knew little about Cassandra. Nathan had never brought her home during university, never acted lovesick. Their breakup had been so uneventful, they’d wondered if she’d mattered at all.

But now, with Nathan married, Cassandra’s email was a landmine—and Evelyn had just stepped on it.

Swallowing hard, Evelyn forced a smile. "Just tell me what to say, and I’ll type it."

Nathan met her gaze. "It’s not about relaying my words. It’s about your reply."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

The gossip’s backfiring on me now?! She wants to meet in two weeks—what am I supposed to say?!

"Reply… what?"

Nathan’s gaze sharpened. "You know who sent this. As my wife, shouldn’t you know how to respond?"
###Chapter 121: The Art of Strategic Retreat

Thunder cracked ominously overhead, mirroring the storm brewing in Evelyn Sinclair’s mind.

Should I really reply to your ex’s email as your wife? Is this some kind of test?

Her thoughts spun like a carousel gone rogue. What was Nathan Blackwood really implying?



The email had been an accident—opened in a moment of distracted curiosity. Her initial plan? Play dumb, let Nathan discover it himself and handle it quietly. But no, he’d dragged it into the open, demanding her input.

Is this his way of warning me his first love is back, and I should gracefully bow out?

Nathan’s jaw tightened, irritation flashing in his stormy gaze.

Meanwhile, Margaret and Genevieve exchanged wide-eyed glances, their breaths held.

No, Evelyn realized with a jolt. He’s asking how I, as his wife, should respond.

Nathan’s voice, deceptively calm, cut through her panic. "You can reply however you like."

Evelyn’s mind raced.

Option one: The indifferent brush-off.
"Alright, I’ll wait for you."

Nathan’s expression froze.

Option two: The CEO’s icy dismissal.
"You walked away first. Don’t expect me to care now."

Option three: The coy deflection.
"He’s not divorced yet."

Nathan’s lips twitched—almost a smile.

Margaret and Genevieve clutched imaginary pearls. For heaven’s sake, pick a lane!

"Sweetheart," Nathan murmured, the endearment dripping like honey—and sending a shiver down Evelyn’s spine. He never called her that. Was he… provoked?

His gaze darkened, predatory. Oh, you absolutely provoked me.

Evelyn’s instincts screamed danger. She backpedaled fast. "Maybe… we just ignore it? No harm, no foul, right?" Brilliant. Neutral. Safe.

Nathan studied her for a long, suffocating moment before exhaling. "Hmm."

Genevieve nearly combusted. "Evelyn! You should’ve shut her down!"

And risk becoming the villain of their love story? No thanks. Evelyn smirked internally. Let Cassandra make the first move. I’ll be the picture of grace—until it’s time not to be.

As Nathan watched her humming while organizing her latest "confiscated treasures," his chest tightened. She had no idea the game she was playing—or that he’d already changed the rules.

Overseas, Cassandra’s penthouse

Her friend scowled at the unanswered email. "Who does she think she is? Mrs. Blackwood in name only! Nathan only married her out of obligation—why else no wedding? His friends don’t even acknowledge her!"

Cassandra’s smile was razor-thin. "Perfect. A fool is easy to crush." She pocketed her phone. "When I reappear in Nathan’s life, he’ll see everything she’s hidden from him. And then…"

Her friend grinned. "You’ll be the real Mrs. Blackwood."

Back home, Evelyn sneezed violently.

Nathan draped his jacket over her shoulders. "Cold?"

"Someone’s plotting," she muttered, rubbing her nose.

His brow arched just as her phone rang—Isabelle Laurent’s name flashing on screen.

Now what?

###Chapter 122: The Unexpected Offer

Evelyn Sinclair blinked in surprise as Isabelle Laurent's voice crackled through the phone. "So, what do you think about Seraphina?"

The question caught her off guard. Why is everyone suddenly asking me about Seraphina today?

The lively chatter in the private dining room dimmed as Evelyn's thoughts spiraled. Nathan Blackwood, ever the silent observer, merely sipped his wine while Margaret and Genevieve exchanged curious glances.

Evelyn hesitated before voicing her confusion. "Did you hear what happened earlier?"

Isabelle sounded genuinely puzzled. "Hear what?"

Ah. So she hadn’t been informed yet.

Since it involved industry drama, Evelyn gave her new manager a brief rundown—careful not to reveal everything she knew from the Gossip System but making her stance clear. "There’s definitely been a misunderstanding. When I asked Vivienne for proof, she had nothing. Just insults."

A sharp burst of laughter erupted from the other end of the line.

"She actually tried to intimidate you into helping her? Those entitled socialites never change. Bet they nearly fainted when they realized who they were dealing with. Wish I’d been there to see it!"

Evelyn stifled a chuckle. So Isabelle enjoyed drama too. But the amusement was short-lived.

"Vivienne must’ve been desperate to confront Seraphina," Isabelle mused, her tone shifting. "Adrian probably made his intentions clear. With no other options, she needed an ally—and that’s why she reached out to us."

Evelyn frowned. "What?"

Isabelle sighed. "We exchanged contacts before. Today, she asked to join our agency."

What?

The entire Blackwood family turned in unison, their expressions mirroring Evelyn’s shock.

"Her current contract’s expiring soon," Isabelle explained. "She planned to use this show to prove her worth and land a new deal. At first, she wouldn’t have considered us—Julian’s studio only caters to him. But then you came along, and with Vivienne breathing down her neck, she took a gamble."

A pause. Isabelle’s voice softened. "I called to ask your opinion, but—"

Evelyn cut in, baffled. "Don’t you have final say on contracts?"

Isabelle laughed, clearly entertained by Evelyn’s naivety.

Marcus and Julian had hinted that Evelyn would eventually take over the agency. Even if Isabelle had authority, it was only right to consult the future boss.

But Evelyn, ever the artist, would probably find the idea of being a boss exhausting.

"Since you’d be working under the same label," Isabelle continued, "harmony matters. If you dislike her, I won’t sign her."

Evelyn scoffed. "How could I dislike her? I barely know her."

"Ninety percent of women in this industry dislike her on sight."

Evelyn’s brows shot up.

Setting aside the rumors, most actresses avoided Seraphina instinctively. The reason? Simple: her looks.

Beauty came in many forms, but Seraphina’s was the most dangerous kind.

To men, she was mesmerizing. To women? Intimidating. Her gaze held a sultry allure, her presence like a ripe fruit—impossible to ignore.

Evelyn recalled the variety show where Seraphina had been humiliated. The other female guests had maintained composure, but the moment Seraphina mounted the mechanical bull, laughter erupted. Yet she’d  the challenge flawlessly, only for a guest to sneer, "Why bother competing? We can’t beat Ms. Delacroix."

The malice was palpable.

Isabelle had already discussed Seraphina’s situation with Marcus.

She admired Seraphina’s acting skills and her ability to generate buzz—controversial or not. Managing her would be a thrilling challenge. Plus, Seraphina had made significant concessions, which intrigued Isabelle.

But she wouldn’t risk Evelyn’s comfort for professional gain.

Just as she prepared to end the call, Evelyn spoke. "What did Seraphina actually do to deserve this?"

Isabelle’s breath hitched.

Evelyn pressed on. "If she were truly manipulating men, wouldn’t she have better options? Why come to us?"

Vivienne had connections, but so did the men linked to Seraphina. If she were willing to trade favors, she could’ve secured a better deal.

Yet she’d approached Isabelle—a woman who valued professionalism over scandal.

That spoke volumes.

Margaret and Genevieve nodded in silent agreement.

Isabelle chuckled. "You’re not wrong. She agreed to sign for far less than she’s worth—but with one condition."

Evelyn leaned in. "Which is?"

A beat of silence. Then—

"She won’t sell her body."

The room went deathly quiet.

Evelyn’s expression darkened.

In that moment, it felt like a woman battered by fate was clawing her way back—refusing to drown.
###Chapter 123: Can I Count On You?

Isabelle Laurent wasn’t exaggerating Rebecca’s struggles—she genuinely knew the dark underbelly of the entertainment industry.

Rebecca had suffered, but in this ruthless world, those who had it worse were already broken beyond repair. Yet Rebecca was different—resilient, sharp, and unyielding. That was why Isabelle saw potential in her, believing she could rise above the chaos.

Still, caution lingered.

She continued, "Even though she initiated the conversation, who knows what Rebecca is truly like now? A decade in this industry changes people. She was even blacklisted at one point. The external battles are hard enough—what if she becomes her own worst enemy?"

Evelyn Sinclair snapped out of her thoughts and mused aloud. "Isn’t that the risk with every artist we sign? You never really know until you work with them. If it doesn’t work out, we can always terminate the contract. I trust you won’t let the terms be unfavorable."

Isabelle chuckled. "So, does that mean you approve of me signing her?"

Evelyn frowned slightly. Why was Isabelle constantly seeking her opinion? She had already made it clear—Isabelle should trust her own judgment. She knew nothing about these matters.

Just then, Nathan Blackwood gestured for her attention, signaling he had something to say.

Evelyn pressed the phone closer to her ear, listening intently. Nathan leaned in, his breath warm against her skin as he whispered, "She wants to know—if she signs Rebecca, will you back her up?"

The sensation sent a shiver down Evelyn’s spine, making her squirm. In her slight movement, her lips accidentally brushed against Nathan’s—cool, firm, and unexpectedly electrifying.

Evelyn barely registered the contact, but Nathan stiffened, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he took a deliberate step back.

Meanwhile, Evelyn grasped Nathan’s implication perfectly. The man was sharp—a true businessman, always thinking steps ahead.

She sighed. Isabelle had been circling the real issue—Rebecca was a lightning rod for controversy. Without powerful backing, even the innocent got crushed. The entertainment industry wasn’t about justice—it was about who had the deepest pockets.

Isabelle knew Rebecca was trouble. But with Evelyn Sinclair, the Blackwood family’s lady, behind her? She’d be unstoppable. The more scandals, the higher she’d rise.

But if Evelyn refused, signing Rebecca would be career suicide.

That was the real reason for tonight’s call.

Hearing about the wives’ alliance drama, Isabelle had nearly backed out. But Evelyn’s unexpectedly positive reaction made her test the waters again.

"You want me to support her? That’s… complicated."

Nathan’s brow twitched. Anticipating her next words, he cut in smoothly.

"Remember, you’re Mrs. Blackwood. My resources are yours. Back whoever you want."

Evelyn blinked, surprised by his sudden generosity. Still, she muttered under her breath, "What if we divorce someday—"

Nathan nearly groaned. Could she at least pretend to believe in our marriage?

Across from them, Margaret and Genevieve coughed pointedly.

Margaret quickly interjected, "Don’t worry, Evelyn. If fate has brought this girl to our attention, it’s for a reason. Consider it charity—we’ll take the lead."

Decision made, Isabelle ended the call.

Curiosity piqued, everyone began researching Rebecca on their phones during the ride home.

They preferred Evelyn’s unfiltered take over biased media reports—and she didn’t disappoint.

Damn. This is tragic.

Her beauty is a curse.

From a young age, Rebecca developed faster than her peers, making her a target for boys’ teasing and girls’ jealousy. Thankfully, her loving family shielded her from lasting damage.

But her first real horror came in sixth grade—a predatory teacher cornered her. She fought back, striking his head and escaping. Her parents stormed the school, demanding justice.

The school? They silenced it. Called her a liar. Claimed she fabricated the story for attention or revenge over grades.

With no proof, her parents—ordinary, honest people—could only transfer her to another school.

Margaret and Genevieve were livid. Then Genevieve stumbled upon an old article—

A teacher had publicly smeared Rebecca, calling her "precocious," claiming she had seduced him.

Rosalie’s grip on her phone tightened. "We can’t let this bastard get away with it!"

Margaret cleared her throat. "Let’s not jump to conclusions. Investigations exist for a reason. What if he’s the predator? How many kids has he hurt?"

Yes! Margaret gets it!

Nathan glanced at the article and nodded. "I’ll have someone look into it."

Before he could finish, Evelyn made a small sound of surprise.

"No need. He’s already been dealt with."

Everyone turned. Evelyn’s brow was furrowed slightly.

When she saw the rumors, she remembered that vile teacher. Fueled by rage and fear for other victims, she’d turned to the wealthy patron she’d been entangled with back then.

The man hadn’t bothered with legalities—he’d sent thugs to break the teacher’s limbs, leaving him crippled.

Silence filled the car.

Then Genevieve muttered, "What about those junior high boys who tormented her? They deserve payback too."



###Chapter 124: A Lifetime of Sorrow for a Beauty

Margaret and Genevieve immediately began scouring the internet for rumors.

As expected, so-called middle school "classmates" came forward with scandalous claims.

"Violet had a way with boys since middle school. She'd flirt with multiple at once, as if she wanted every boy in school orbiting around her. She was a tease—leading them on, then acting indifferent. She played games until the boys retaliated. Things got so bad the police got involved, and she even accused them, forcing one boy to transfer. She was a heartbreaker. None of us liked her—we all knew what she was really like."

But Evelyn knew the truth.

Those three boys had been nothing but juvenile pests, sitting behind Violet. Their twisted adolescent fantasies spiraled out of control. They consumed inappropriate content, then projected their warped desires onto her, misinterpreting every glance, every word. They boasted among themselves—one claimed Violet liked him, another insisted she was flaunting herself for him, and the last outright lied about an encounter with her in the school grove.

Driven by jealousy and competition, they lured her there.

At first, they questioned her about her romantic interests. Violet, who had kept to herself, was stunned. Furious, she lashed out. But fragile male pride turned to malice.

The school intervened before things escalated further. The boys, snapping out of their daze, panicked. Violet’s parents pressed charges. The boys’ parents, instead of acknowledging their sons’ actions, attacked Violet—claiming she was the problem, that her looks had provoked them.

The law sided with Violet, but the boys, being minors, faced light consequences and transferred. Violet had to leave too.

Margaret and Genevieve were livid. They dissected the rumors, pointing out inconsistencies, defending Violet fiercely.

Then—another bombshell.

"A male classmate once committed suicide over Violet."

Silence fell.

Evelyn dug deeper.

The truth? The boy had been under unbearable pressure from his overbearing parents. When his grades slipped, they found hidden photos of Violet in his room. Instead of addressing his mental health, they blamed her—accusing her of seducing him, ruining his focus.

Humiliated in front of the school, the boy jumped.

Even after it was proven Violet didn’t even know him, his parents hounded her, harassed her family, and drove her parents to their deaths in a stress-induced accident.

All that remained was her injured grandmother.

Margaret and Genevieve’s eyes burned with tears. This wasn’t drama—it was tragedy.

"This rumor is even worse than the last! How is any of this her fault?" Margaret cried.

"Exactly!" Genevieve snapped. "His parents’ public shaming probably pushed him over the edge!"

Evelyn nodded grimly.

She kept reading.

Violet had entered the entertainment industry out of desperation—her grandmother’s medical bills were crushing. Regular jobs were impossible; harassment followed her everywhere.

The industry seemed safer than the clubs she’d briefly worked in. But her agency exploited her naivety, trapping her in a decade-long contract with impossible penalties.

Men with power pursued her—not to save her, but to own her. She refused to rely on them.

Now, finally free, she’d asked Isabelle Laurent for one thing: a slight raise. Enough to cover her grandmother’s care.

Evelyn’s heart ached. She’d once dismissed Violet as just another scandal-ridden star. Now, she saw the survivor beneath.

Nathan, watching Evelyn’s distress, rested a hand on her head. "Her luck’s about to change. Meeting you—that’s her turning point."

Evelyn met his gaze, finding quiet certainty there.

She messaged Isabelle, reinforcing her stance. Behind the scenes, negotiations were already underway—Violet’s future was being rewritten.

Three days later, the draw confirmed it: their teams would face off.

Online, the mob was already baying for Violet’s blood.

Only the director and producer, privy to Team A-List’s plans, lay awake in dread.

Another damn confidential script.

The storm was coming.
###Chapter 125: Whispered Secrets

The moment Evelyn heard it was a confidential script, unease prickled at her skin.

After all, Seraphina had once taunted, "If you cast me, aren’t you afraid your precious show will implode?"

Not to mention the tension still lingering from their past clashes.

Evelyn’s gut twisted with worry—what if Team A-List’s performance was designed to expose Grayson?

During the final rehearsal, she couldn’t resist cornering Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe.

"Mrs. Hart, we genuinely don’t know," Donovan said, exasperated. "Even if there are rehearsal clips, they’re heavily edited. We see barely anything."

Preston, ever the purist, scoffed. "Why the concern? Your husband’s reputation is spotless. Team A-List claims to stand for justice—why would they target him?"

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "Justice? Please. This industry runs on power plays. What if they’re just silencing competition under the guise of morality? Their past targets were convenient scapegoats. Who’s to say they won’t fabricate lies next?"

The men exchanged glances. Her paranoia wasn’t entirely unfounded—Team A-List’s crusade did seem too idealistic for Hollywood’s cutthroat arena.

"If they come for us, I need ammunition to defend my husband," Evelyn pressed. "Just a small favor—"

"We’re not omniscient," Donovan cut in. "We can’t help you."

Evelyn’s smile turned icy. "Then what about inserting our footage during their segment? A… counter-narrative."

Preston recoiled. "Absolutely not. We won’t sabotage our own show with staged scandals."

"They’re not staged," she hissed. "They’re reenactments of facts."

Donovan’s patience snapped. "We’ve indulged you enough. Tampering with the broadcast is non-negotiable."

Fury ignited in Evelyn’s chest. Desperation loosened her tongue. "Or is this refusal because you’re both sleeping with Seraphina?"

Silence.

The directors stared, aghast. Evelyn instantly regretted her words—too far, even for her. Mumbling an apology, she fled.

Outside, she nearly collided with a group of staffers. Humiliation burned her cheeks as she stormed off, only to spot a familiar figure.

Marcus jogged over, feigning concern. "Aunt Evelyn, any progress?"

Her jaw clenched. "Weren’t you supposed to watch Grayson and that witch?"

Marcus smirked. "Rehearsal break. She slithered off. But honestly, what’s the point? Their ‘scripted’ flirting might as well be foreplay. The way she looks at him—disgusting."

Evelyn’s vision tinged red. If Seraphina were here, she’d claw her eyes out.

Marcus sighed theatrically. "Uncle Grayson owes everything to you. Our family would’ve starved without your backing. And now he dares mention divorce? Over her?" He squeezed Evelyn’s shoulder. "We’ll disown him before we betray you."

The loyalty soothed her. "There won’t be a divorce."

Marcus’s eyes gleamed. He launched into sycophantic praises, painting himself as her devoted ally. Evelyn preened—childless, she’d doted on Grayson’s nephews. Marcus’s sudden acting career? Her doing.

"You’re a good boy," she cooed. "Unlike the others, you see her for the trash she is."

A shadow crossed Marcus’s face. "She tried seducing me. Made my skin crawl."

Evelyn beamed. "Exactly. Filthy creature."

Meanwhile, in a bathroom stall, Evelyn Sinclair’s legs had gone numb from eavesdropping.

"Netizens are betting Team A-List will expose her next. But since she’s sleeping with Preston and Donovan, they might chicken out."

Evelyn stifled a groan. Peeking through the door, she recognized Preston’s assistants—bold, gossiping about their bosses.

"Serves her right. Sleeping her way to the top? Disgusting."

"Think it was separate… or a threesome? I saw her enter the greenroom with both. An hour later, she had that post-coital glow."

Cackling, the women left.

Evelyn stepped out—and froze.

Seraphina stood at the mirror, eyes red-rimmed, slapping her cheeks. Forcing a smile, she practiced it until it looked effortless. Then, chin high, she strode out.

Evelyn whistled low. Damn. The acting’s too good.

Outside, Lillian Graves intercepted her. "Ms. Sinclair, Isabelle sent me. You’re needed."

Evelyn assumed it was about skipping rehearsal—until she realized Preston wanted an emergency meeting.

Her pulse jumped. Perfect. Time to stir the pot.

Across the room, Julian and Genevieve Blackwood caught her manic grin.

They didn’t know what she’d overheard… but trouble was brewing.

"Oh, this’ll be delicious," Evelyn thought. "Loose lips sink ships—and I’ve got the torpedo."

Julian and Genevieve exchanged glances. Whatever Evelyn was plotting, someone’s reputation was about to implode.
###Chapter 126 - Under The Spotlight

Evelyn Sinclair was the last to arrive. Her sharp gaze swept across the room, confirming everyone’s presence with a satisfied nod.

Only Isabelle Laurent remained actively engaged with Team A-List, while Marcus Donovan focused on handling Julian Blackwood’s international affairs.

Unfamiliar with Team A-List’s dynamics, Isabelle frowned at Evelyn’s barely contained excitement. Even Julian and Genevieve’s demeanors had shifted the moment Evelyn walked in—their eyes gleaming with anticipation.

What just changed? They didn’t even want to come earlier. Why do I feel like something terrible is about to happen?

Evelyn noticed the staff members behind Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe exchanging knowing smirks, their eyes darting between the two men and Rebecca.

Preston and Donovan remained oblivious.

Rebecca stood nearby, unfazed by the hostile glares. Her serene smile never wavered, as though she hadn’t just endured vicious rumors. Yet, her gaze held a quiet intensity when she glanced at Isabelle—still waiting for an answer.

No refusal means there’s still hope.

Gordon, the veteran actor, maintained his affable facade, but his lingering stares at Rebecca betrayed his true thoughts.

Age is just a number, but a twenty-year gap? Seriously, old man? Can’t you see Rebecca avoiding your gaze?

Julian and Genevieve exchanged glances. In previous episodes, Gordon hadn’t been this blatant. Had the impending divorce emboldened him?

Even with Ruth hovering nearby, trying to shield Rebecca from his advances, his attention remained fixated.

Then, a tall figure stepped closer to Rebecca, breaking the tension.

Her expression flickered when she noticed Simon beside her.

Who is that? Evelyn’s curiosity piqued.

"Just a supporting actor, I think. Don’t know him," Julian muttered.

No name meant no gossip. Evelyn’s instincts flared—was he another troublemaker?

Isabelle answered swiftly, "That’s Simon, Gordon’s nephew. A rookie actor—lazy, really. Mrs. Gonzales brought him in to keep tabs on things."

The group stared at her, impressed by her insider knowledge.

Thumbs-up all around.

So, he’s a watchdog, not a threat? Boring. Time to dig into Mrs. Gonzales’ schemes.

Preston launched into a lengthy speech, but Team A-List had already tuned out, lost in their own whispered scandals—as if they weren’t even in the same room.

Vicious. Thank goodness the production team has standards.

Defamation, plain and simple. How dare they slander someone like this?

Evelyn’s fragmented thoughts frustrated Julian and Genevieve.

What’s happening? Spill it already! Spoilers won’t hurt us. The sooner we know, the better we can prepare. What if we’re blindsided?

Preston wiped sweat from his brow, nodding along mechanically.

Rebecca rarely lost her composure under fire—especially after Evelyn and her team had seemed so righteous earlier. She’d foolishly hoped for fairness.

But rumors like these? Once they spread, no denial would ever be enough. The best she could do was play dumb.

Yet this time stung worse. Even Team A-List doubted her. The contract she’d pinned her hopes on? Gone.

She wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn’t come. She’d grown numb to such blows.

But this was public humiliation.

She’d been slapped, hair yanked, dragged through mud before. The men would whisk their crazed wives away, never defending her. The room’s stares would freeze her blood. No matter what she said, no one believed her.

This scene felt identical. The room fell silent. All eyes locked onto her—sharp, judgmental, cutting.

Her lips parted, but her throat closed. Defeated, she swallowed her words.

Then—

"What?!" Preston gasped.

Donovan paled. "Ms. Sinclair, you can’t possibly believe that."

The two men were visibly shaken.

Others reacted with shock, whispers, or morbid fascination.

Rebecca blinked. This was different. Preston and Donovan genuinely hadn’t suspected her. Maybe this time, she could speak up.

She lifted her head—and met Evelyn’s amused smile.

Her breath hitched. "Ms. Sinclair, you’ve misunderstood. There’s nothing improper between Mr. Whitmore or Mr. Sharpe and me. Those are just rumors. I’m innocent."

No mockery followed. Only Evelyn’s delighted gaze, sparkling with mischief.

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning confusion. "Oh? Just rumors? But I heard it straight from Mr. Whitmore’s assistants."

She pointed at three girls behind Preston and Donovan—now ghostly pale.

"They were in the bathroom, claiming you had a threesome with Mr. Whitmore and Mr. Sharpe for an hour—that they saw it with their own eyes. That your goal was to take us down."

Gasps filled the room.

Evelyn shrugged. "Naturally, I was concerned. Since everyone’s here, why not clear the air?"

Preston and Donovan whirled toward the three girls.

Exposed under the spotlight, their legs trembled.

Can filth truly hide in the light?


###Chapter 127: Even Paparazzi Weren't This Relentless

The tension in the room was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair dropped the bombshell without a shred of hesitation. She wasn’t one to mince words, and the uncomfortable silence that followed was proof of that.

Evelyn herself remained unfazed, her arms crossed as she waited for a response.

Julian Blackwood stifled a chuckle behind his hand, while Genevieve’s eyes gleamed with barely contained amusement.

Isabelle Laurent, the ever-pragmatic manager, resisted the urge to facepalm. Unexpected drama was the last thing she needed—but then again, controversy did generate headlines.

Rebecca Yancey, however, was frozen in shock. So that was why Evelyn had been acting so strangely earlier—she had overheard everything in the restroom.

No one had anticipated such a scandal unfolding live on set. Whether the rumors were true or not, the damage was already done.

The three girls responsible for the gossip looked like they were about to faint, their faces draining of color.

"That’s absolute rubbish!" Preston Whitmore snapped, his voice sharp with fury.

Donovan Sharpe’s glare was equally icy. "You had the audacity to spread lies like this on our show? Do you even want to keep your jobs? Explain yourselves—how exactly did you 'see' this?"

Two of the girls immediately panicked, shoving the third—the ringleader—forward. The girl who had been so bold with her accusations earlier now trembled under the weight of scrutiny.

"Ms. Sinclair must have misheard," she stammered. "There’s no way Ms. Yancey would ever—"

"My hearing is just fine, thank you," Evelyn cut in smoothly. "You were practically shouting in there. Did you want someone to overhear you?"

The girl’s eyes welled up with tears, her lower lip quivering. She looked at Evelyn with a mix of fear and resentment, as if she were the one being wronged.

"I never said that!" she insisted, her voice cracking.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Really? Because I distinctly remember you claiming you saw Ms. Yancey sneaking into Mr. Whitmore and Mr. Sharpe’s private rooms."

The girl paled. "That’s impossible! I was with Mr. Whitmore the entire time—Ms. Yancey never met with either of them alone! Please, Ms. Sinclair, don’t twist my words!"

The other two girls quickly nodded in agreement, though their expressions betrayed their unease.

Evelyn smirked. "So, you’re certain Ms. Yancey never seduced anyone for the competition? You’re positive she’s innocent?"

All three nodded vigorously.

"How interesting." Evelyn pulled out her phone.

The girls’ faces went slack with horror.

Sure enough, Evelyn played the damning recording—their voices crystal clear as they gleefully spread the rumor.

The room fell dead silent.

"I always keep receipts for serious accusations," Evelyn said with a click of her tongue.

The evidence was undeniable. The girl who had started the rumor collapsed to her knees, her bravado gone.

Preston and Donovan were livid. "You dare cry after what you did?" Preston roared. "You just swore Ms. Yancey never met with us—and now we have proof you lied!"

The girl could only sob, her career crumbling before her.

Though apologies were made and the situation was "handled," the damage lingered.

"Don’t apologize to us," Donovan snapped. "Apologize to Ms. Yancey."

The girl turned to Rebecca, bowing her head. "I’m sorry, Ms. Yancey."

Rebecca didn’t respond. She simply stared, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

The onlookers shifted uncomfortably. Some exchanged knowing glances—this would be juicy gossip later.

Rebecca knew Evelyn had exposed this to help her. But what good did it do?

The truth was out, but the whispers would continue.

Some people had already made up their minds.

And nothing would change that.


###Chapter 128: Revelations in the Spotlight

Just then, Evelyn spoke up again, her voice laced with skepticism. "Or are you only apologizing because you're afraid of retaliation from Mr. Whitmore and Mr. Sharpe? Because in that video, your remorse seemed genuine to me."

The crowd froze. Evelyn had struck a nerve.

When scandals like this went public, someone always had to take the fall.

Maybe the young woman was telling the truth after all.

Rebecca gasped as if an arrow had been yanked from her chest. She stared at Evelyn in stunned silence, the fog of confusion lifting.

"No! I was just—just talking nonsense. I really didn’t mean—" The girl stammered, torn between admitting the truth and clinging to her lie.

But words, once spoken, were like spilled water—impossible to take back, even if they evaporated into thin air.

At first, Preston and Donovan had assumed Evelyn’s relentless questioning stemmed from genuine suspicion about their involvement with Rebecca.

But as their gazes swept across the room, taking in the varied expressions of the onlookers, they finally understood what felt off.

Even if the accuser confessed, not everyone would believe it. And tonight’s drama would undoubtedly be twisted beyond recognition in the retelling.

Preston and Donovan clenched their fists, itching to throttle the girl right then and there.

With a resigned sigh, they exchanged glances before their eyes flicked to Rebecca. Had the rumors about her in the industry always been this baseless?

For the first time, Preston and Donovan found themselves overlooking the trouble Evelyn had caused them. Instead, they felt a strange relief—at least this mess had exposed the truth.

In their case, their innocence was undeniable.

Donovan, too irritated to defend himself, waved over a veteran cameraman. "Lawrence, tell them—could this kind of rumor possibly be true?"

Lawrence hesitated, then scoffed. "Absolutely not. But newcomers wouldn’t know. Mr. Sharpe is Mr. Whitmore’s brother-in-law! They’d never do something like that. In fact, Donovan actively keeps women away from Preston! That’s why Preston’s never had a scandal—he’s completely whipped. And Donovan? He’s got a sister complex. They’re both ridiculously clingy—"

The more Lawrence rambled, the more Preston and Donovan cringed. "Enough!" Preston cut in sharply. "That’s more than enough to prove our innocence regarding Ms. Yancey."

Evelyn nearly choked on her laughter.

I just wanted them to clarify their relationship to debunk the rumors. I didn’t expect them to spill all this tea. But hey, not my fault.

Julian and Genevieve exchanged knowing looks. The reason they could pull off such an extravagant event was because they had the backing of a formidable businesswoman behind the scenes.

Genevieve, hearing this for the first time, couldn’t help but grin. Finally, Rebecca’s name would be cleared.

She glanced over and saw Rebecca staring blankly at Evelyn, her usual coquettish mask gone, replaced by raw, youthful bewilderment.

She looked like a prisoner who couldn’t believe her luck had finally turned.

Satisfied with the reactions around her, Evelyn decided to wrap things up.

"Well, if that’s the case, then I believe you," she said, though she couldn’t resist adding, "But what about you accusing Ms. Yancey of seducing your boyfriend?"

The girl flinched as if struck. "I—I was wrong. My boyfriend only looked at her from afar. It was all my fault."

Evelyn sighed dramatically. "Oh, why do women always blame each other instead of holding men accountable? Tsk tsk." She turned to Rebecca with a smile. "My apologies for almost misunderstanding you."

Rebecca’s voice trembled. "No, I should be thanking you, Ms. Sinclair. Truly, thank you."

Her tone was so uncharacteristically sincere that those who knew her did a double take. She composed herself quickly, but the glimmer in her eyes betrayed her emotions.

Was Evelyn’s help a sign that her agency might sign her?

"Thankfully, the truth is out now," Evelyn said, glancing pointedly at Ruth. "Ms. Yancey was unfairly dragged into this mess. But as they say—the truth always wins!"

Those on Evelyn’s side caught her underlying message.

She’d used this incident to give Ruth one final warning: See how easily rumors destroy reputations? Think twice before spreading lies.

They all understood. And Ruth probably did too.

But when it was over, Ruth’s eyes burned with fury as she watched her husband rush to comfort Rebecca.

She never expected Rebecca to approach her first.

Rebecca, who had always avoided her, now stood before her, desperation in her eyes. She knew the wives’ circle had planned to sabotage her performance—the most crucial gamble of her career. Her contract was ending, her passion for performing had just begun to bloom, and her grandmother’s medical bills loomed over her. She couldn’t afford any setbacks.

Ruth’s lips curled into a bitter smile. Confront me? So I can hear my husband say he’s divorcing me for her?

Rebecca saw her disbelief and pressed on. "I swear—after this performance, I’ll never see Mr. Gonzales again. Can’t you believe that I never seduced him?"

Her voice was so sharp it startled Ruth.

But Ruth quickly recovered. "I know why you’re here. But forget it. You ruined my marriage. I won’t let you off that easily." With that, she turned and stormed away.

Rebecca stood frozen, her face pale. No matter what she said, no one would believe her.

That night, Isabelle had already crafted today’s narrative, weaving together insider revelations. She posted them across multiple platforms—the first step in clearing Rebecca’s name.

With the competition’s live stream scheduled for the next day, the post went viral instantly.

Evelyn scrolled through the buzz at home, but aside from Isabelle’s post, the internet had already latched onto Rebecca’s scandal.

Old rumors resurfaced, new ones fabricated—clearly manipulated. The drama was only beginning.

This wasn’t just the wives’ doing. Even Rebecca’s schoolmates had crawled out of the woodwork, eager for their fifteen minutes of fame.

An hour before the live broadcast, the makeup room buzzed with tension.

Evelyn’s eyes flicked to the trending headlines: #RebeccaYanceyLeaveTheIndustry topped the list.

She glanced at Rebecca, who sat calmly scrolling through her phone.

Gordon and Simon looked grim. Ruth was conspicuously absent.

Just as Evelyn wondered why, the production team announced they’d be heading to set soon.

Then Gordon suddenly stood and approached Rebecca. "Rebecca, we need to talk. Outside."

Confused, Rebecca followed him out.

The moment the door closed behind them in an empty room, Gordon dropped to one knee and pulled out a ring.

"Rebecca," he said, voice trembling. "Marry me."

Back in the makeup room, Evelyn’s jaw dropped.

Holy. Crap.

The Blackwoods, about to take their seats in the audience, exchanged puzzled glances.

Gossip at a time like this?!

###Chapter 129: The Shocking Truth Behind His Madness

The Blackwood family lingered backstage, eager to catch the latest scandalous details before leaving. Nathan Blackwood had presented Claudia Bennett with divorce papers, officially ending their marriage. The shock had sent Claudia straight to the hospital, which explained her absence tonight. But seriously, Nathan? Your wife is lying in a hospital bed, and here you are, proposing to another woman? You always acted so righteous—who knew you could be this unhinged?

The Blackwoods: This is beyond outrageous!

What a mess. Apparently, Seraphina Delacroix had mustered the courage to explain the situation to Claudia yesterday. Though Claudia had seemed skeptical at first, a seed of doubt had been planted. But then she returned home to find the divorce papers waiting—along with a few choice words—and suddenly, innocent Seraphina was dragged back into the chaos. Nathan, for Seraphina to have crossed paths with you, she must have committed some grave sins in her past life.

A smirk tugged at Evelyn Sinclair’s lips.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood family stood speechless. This wasn’t a marriage proposal—it was a declaration of war.

Oh, and the reason for the sudden proposal? Nathan had been provoked by something his wife said…

The Blackwoods: What did she say?

Ha! Turns out, Claudia had noticed that Seraphina didn’t love Nathan at all. But Nathan refused to believe it. He was convinced he held a special place in her heart, citing the way she looked at him during their scenes together. Delusional much?

Julian Blackwood scoffed. "She’s an actress, Nathan. If she acted like she was in love with you on set, that’s just her job."

Nathan genuinely believed that Seraphina—a woman in her twenties—admired him, a refined, cultured man in his forties who took great care of himself. She often sought his advice on acting, her eyes filled with what he mistook for admiration. Unlike the polite indifference she showed other men, her attention toward him felt real. But here’s the thing—Seraphina approached all seasoned actors with the same sincerity when she needed guidance. Maybe Nathan just mistook professionalism for affection because he wanted to believe it.

Richard Blackwood sighed. "So you’ve been living in a fantasy this whole time? Just because a junior colleague asks for your advice, you think she’s in love with you? If that were true, I’d have had a harem before I retired!"

The truth? Nathan was obsessed with Seraphina’s beauty but refused to admit it. He insisted he hadn’t fallen out of love with Claudia—no, the love had faded long ago. The lack of intimacy in their marriage was proof, he claimed, because Claudia no longer stirred any desire in him.

Margaret Blackwood arched a brow. "That’s the greatest insult to a long-married couple. Or maybe the problem isn’t Claudia—maybe it’s you?"

Nathan swore Seraphina had revived his heart, making him feel alive again. For her, he was willing to face society’s scorn, to give her everything she desired.

Sophia Blackwood rolled her eyes. "Did you even ask Seraphina what she wants?"

No wonder Claudia was furious. But no matter how angry she was, she shouldn’t have directed her rage at Seraphina. She should have aimed it at her husband.

The Blackwoods nodded in agreement. Wrong target, Claudia.

This was a vicious cycle—the more Claudia insulted Seraphina, the harder Nathan defended her, escalating the conflict. Claudia’s hatred for Seraphina only grew, and Nathan’s delusions deepened. Could they please stop dragging others into their twisted mess?

The Blackwoods exchanged uneasy glances.

Something about Nathan’s words felt… off. Wait a minute—wasn’t that a line from a scene they’d cut during rehearsals? The one where the male lead, convinced he was saving the courtesan, spouted self-righteous nonsense about changing her fate? In reality, he was just feeding his own ego, basking in the illusion of being her savior.

Julian and Genevieve Blackwood remembered that scene well. In the end, the man had been drawn to the girl’s beauty and the adoration in her eyes—until he grew bored and began despising her past.

Their expressions darkened.

Isabelle Laurent frowned at Evelyn. "What’s wrong? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. You’re about to go on stage—don’t mess this up!"

Evelyn hesitated. Should she warn Isabelle about the proposal?

After a moment, she shrugged. "Just curious. Claudia didn’t show. Do you think they’ve actually divorced? If so… is Nathan really going to propose to Seraphina? What happens to our contract with her?"

Isabelle waved a hand. "Relax. Seraphina won’t say yes. As long as he doesn’t propose right now, it doesn’t matter."

Evelyn blinked. "Right now?"

Isabelle smirked. "Exactly. If he proposes now, it’ll look like he’s pressuring her—using this performance as leverage. This is her big moment. If she doesn’t sign with us, tonight could make or break her career."

Evelyn and the Blackwoods froze.

Oh. Shit.
###Chapter 130: A Sinister Ultimatum

Evelyn Sinclair's expression darkened as she endured Adrian Cross's lengthy monologue. Though she longed to rebuke him sharply, propriety held her tongue.

"Mr. Cross," she began carefully, "you've always been my mentor. I respect you deeply."

Adrian's smile vanished, replaced by a chilling grimace. Evelyn's reluctance was palpable—her furrowed brows, the tension in her posture. To him, her hesitation was nothing but arrogance, a deliberate humiliation.

"Do you know why your agency stopped pressuring you about your expiring contract?" Adrian asked abruptly.

Evelyn stiffened. "Once it expires, they can't control me anymore."

In truth, she suspected her agency had orchestrated the recent smear campaign against her. They should have defended her—their contract was still active—yet they'd done nothing. Perhaps they wanted to break her spirit, force her back into their clutches.

But Adrian's next words sent a shiver down her spine.

"They wouldn't let a cash cow like you go so easily," he murmured. "Especially one so... entertaining for clients."

Evelyn's fists clenched.

"It was my influence that shielded you," Adrian continued smoothly. "I told them you were mine. This project? A gift—proof of what I can offer you."

Nausea twisted in Evelyn's gut. Adrian had built his empire on his wife's wealth, but his connections were formidable. Yet even he couldn't intimidate her agency alone—unless he'd invoked her name.

Seraphina Delacroix.

The thought made Evelyn's blood run cold. Seraphina was volatile, reckless enough to let her husband flirt publicly with his "rival." If Adrian claimed Evelyn had spurned him, Seraphina's wrath would annihilate her career.

Adrian smirked, reading her realization. "Your agency fears her. And now, so should you."

Evelyn forced steadiness into her voice. "No matter their games, I'm leaving. I'll endure whatever comes."

Adrian's mask slipped. "Such ingratitude." He clutched his chest dramatically. "I feel unwell. Perhaps I can't perform tonight..."

Evelyn's breath hitched. He wouldn't.

But the gleam in his eyes confirmed it—this was blackmail.

"Mr. Cross," she pleaded, "the show needs you!"

"Does it?" He shrugged. "With so many withdrawals already, one more won't matter. And given the public's opinion of you..." His smile turned venomous. "Who'd miss your performance?"

Trembling, Evelyn weighed her options. Isabelle Laurent's agency was her last hope, but their strict policies made her a liability. This live show was her chance to prove herself—to silence the rumors with talent.

Yet Adrian was about to steal that too.

Backstage, Nathan Blackwood's gaze sharpened as he spotted the Quirks exiting. Isabelle tensed beside him.

"Something's wrong," she muttered.

Nathan's jaw tightened. He'd seen that look on Evelyn's face before—the look of someone cornered.

Onstage, the host announced a sudden change: "Due to Mr. Cross's health, we'll adjust the lineup. Next up—Julian Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair in A Beautiful Disaster!"

The audience erupted in confusion.

In her hospital room, Seraphina Delacroix smirked at her phone. "Good. Now flood the feed with hate. I want her destroyed."

But as the curtain rose, Evelyn stepped forward—not broken, but blazing with defiance.

The real disaster was only beginning.

Netizen Reactions:

1: Here comes the downfall!
3: Homewreckers deserve this!
5: APOLOGIZE, EVELYN!
7: Jail her!
9: Even her fans are delusional.
12: Team Noble's humiliation starts NOW!
14: Poor Adrian, manipulated by that witch!
16: "Confidant"? More like mistress!
17: Watch this leaked clip with their performance—it’s hilarious!

The screen flickered as Evelyn took her mark. Nathan's voice whispered in her ear, barely audible:

"Don't let him win."

Evelyn inhaled. The game had changed.

And she was done playing by their rules.
###Chapter 131: Reading Juicy Gossip in Her Mind

One Misfortune After Another

The unexpected twist during the live broadcast sent shockwaves through the audience, flooding the comments section with disbelief.

"What just happened?! I was waiting for Team Noble to perform, but Team A-List stole the spotlight with their stage play. Honestly, their 'confidant' theme reeks of hypocrisy!"

"Is Mr. Holloway really sick? Or is this some staged drama? The timing is way too convenient. Are they sabotaging Team A-List?"

"They must think we won’t notice their sloppy plot if they perform later. Newsflash—we see right through it!"

"Pathetic. The problematic artists ran away before the battle even started. Guess they couldn’t handle the heat."

"Maybe the minx got cold feet, afraid of being canceled, and dragged poor Mr. Holloway into her mess."

"They better show up on stage! What’s the point of sitting around like cowards?"

"Let’s see what kind of disaster Team Noble cooks up next."

"Forget them—I’m more interested in Team A-List’s performance. Their theme sounds scandalous!"

Meanwhile, Twitter was a different story due to the broadcast delay.

A skit titled "Confidant" suddenly trended, but since Team Noble hadn’t performed yet, the buzz was lukewarm at best.

Netizens had a rebellious streak. Subtle manipulation worked, but blatant, mindless hate often backfired. Some started questioning the unfair criticism, shifting toward a more balanced perspective.

The real comedy? The "Wives’ Brigade" all posted the same tweet simultaneously:

"Only those who earn their roles through talent deserve respect. Cheaters should leave the industry! You’re not welcome!"

Though they didn’t name names, their target was obvious.

If Team Noble had been performing, the tweet might’ve landed. But posting it before anyone took the stage? Awkward.

The Wives’ Brigade was baffled. Normally, they wouldn’t care about a tweet—someone probably suggested it in their group chat, and they all mindlessly posted.

Now, the replies were flooded with mockery:

"Maybe watch the live stream before tweeting? Wrong timing, ladies."

Panicked, they scrambled to find Victoria Hayes in the group chat.

But deleting the tweets was pointless—netizens had already screenshotted everything. They could only wait for Team Noble’s performance to salvage the situation.

Victoria was frantic, but her concern for Nathan Blackwood overshadowed everything. She called Daniel Prescott immediately.

"I don’t know what’s happening. Nathan said he wasn’t feeling well but refused to go to the hospital. He’s resting backstage. I think he’ll return once he recovers. But Seraphina Delacroix is losing it—she’s already trying to find a replacement!"

"That selfish witch! My husband is sick, and all she cares about is her stupid performance? She won’t even wait for him to recover? Heartless!"

Despite Nathan’s cruelty toward her, Victoria still worried about him. She couldn’t bear the thought of him being discarded when he needed help.

"Relax. I overheard two calls—no one’s willing to help her. It’s not just her scandal; no one wants to perform unprepared. She’s delusional if she thinks she’ll find a last-minute replacement."

Daniel wasn’t convinced about Nathan’s sudden illness. Something felt off.

After hanging up, he spotted a pale, trembling Seraphina approaching him.

"Can you… fill in for Nathan? You know the script. It’s fine if you forget lines—I’ll improvise. Please—"

"And what’s in it for me?" Daniel smirked, eyeing her up and down. "You beat me up last time. Now you want my help?"

Seraphina’s face darkened. During a late rehearsal, Daniel had tried to force himself on her, and she’d taught him a painful lesson.

Now, he stared at her vulnerable expression—like she needed a man’s protection. Hmph. She’s begging for it.

Unable to resist, he leaned in and whispered, "I’ll help… if you come to the restroom with me. Make it worth my while."

His hand shot out to grab her, but she sidestepped smoothly.

Daniel’s face twisted. "Your loss. Keep searching, then." He stormed off.

Seraphina slumped against the wall, her hope fading. Finding a replacement was impossible—especially with her reputation.

Team A-List fought for extra time… and I’m about to fail them.

A wave of despair hit her. Maybe I should just give in. If my career collapses, what will happen to Grandma?

Just as she teetered on the edge, chaos erupted backstage.

Dazed, she turned toward the noise—and froze.

A group of figures had arrived.

The crew scrambled, resetting props in a frenzy.

Isabelle Laurent barked orders, herding supporting actors into position.

The backstage staff was stunned. First, an actor faked illness to dodge the stage. Now, a horde of supporting actors appeared last-minute?

The audience had seen performers bail before—but never like this.

And as the actresses filed past, one thing became clear:

Every single one had been tangled in a sex scandal.

Just like Seraphina.


###Chapter 132: Beauty Isn't the Curse

If it weren't for the last-minute chaos that had everyone scrambling, those who got the inside scoop would’ve been glued to their phones, feverishly spreading the scandalous details.

Instead, they exchanged loaded glances, their eyes screaming with unspoken shock.

This is nuclear-level drama! Team A-list really played their cards right! The entertainment industry is about to implode tonight! Look—even Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Whitmore are stunned.

The confidential script had kept Preston and Donovan on edge all day, bracing for public backlash. But seeing the unfolding disaster, their stomachs dropped.

Backstage, they lit cigarettes, savoring the eerie calm before the storm.

As the stage lights dimmed, haunting background music swelled.

A deep male voice narrated, "History remembers the concubines who used their beauty to ensnare kings, forsaking morality for power, bringing ruin upon nations. They say a beautiful woman is always the root of calamity..."

Then—a sharp, mocking female voice cut in.

Everyone recognized it—Evelyn Sinclair’s voice.

"Oh, so now we’re blaming beautiful women for everything? Typical."

The live chat exploded with question marks.

Wait, wasn’t this supposed to be about corrupt confidants? What is this?

The audience sat frozen—except for the Blackwood family in the front row, practically vibrating with anticipation. Here it comes. The chaos is about to begin.

When people thought of infamous "disaster beauties," one name always came to mind: Anippe.

Right on cue, smoke billowed across the stage, revealing Julian Blackwood as King Haris and Evelyn as Anippe.

The set was a lavish, fake bathing pool—symbolizing decadence.

Julian lounged in the water, basking in luxury while Evelyn obediently fed him wine. She was the only concubine present.

Suddenly, a vassal stormed in, dropping to his knees. "Your Majesty, I beg you—halt the construction of the Star Tower! It’s draining the treasury and exhausting the people!"

Julian’s expression darkened. "How dare you question me? I built it for my beloved. Know your place!" He yanked Evelyn into his arms. "More wine, darling."

But Evelyn’s movements were stiff.

At first, viewers assumed she was nervous—until Julian gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Do you agree with them, my love? Don’t you want to ascend the tower with me? To seek immortality?"

Evelyn’s hands trembled. "Y-yes, of course."

It was then that the audience realized—she wasn’t playing a seductress. She was terrified of him.

"Witch!" The vassal pointed accusingly. "You’ve poisoned the king’s mind! Neglecting his duties for pleasure—I’ll kill you to break this spell!"

Evelyn flinched, hiding behind Julian as guards seized the vassal.

"Your Majesty, she’s the curse! Execute her, and the kingdom will be saved!"

Julian smirked. "I’ll execute you first."

A sword flashed—the vassal fell.

Then, the screen lit up with ancient texts, flooding with accusations:

"Anippe is a witch! She manipulated the king!"
"Destroy her, and Abrazia will prosper!"
"Death to the seductress!"

Darkness swallowed the stage—except for one spotlight on Evelyn, shaking behind Julian.

Her voice cracked with raw fury. "What did I ever do? Why am I the villain?"

She slapped Julian. "I was just a girl with a fiancé! The king took me by force! Could I refuse him? Could I command him? You blame me because he skipped court?"

She whirled on the dead vassal. "The tower was his idea! The cruelty was his choice! If beauty corrupts men, then execute every maid in the palace! Why just me?!"

Finally, she pointed at the screen, screaming, "You’re all cowards! Weak men hiding behind a woman’s skirts! The king was incompetent, his advisors useless—but I’m the disaster? I won’t accept this!"

The live chat erupted.

"Ohhh, Team A-list is flipping the script! Beauty isn’t the curse—men’s weakness is!"
"Seriously, why do we always blame women for kings being trash?"
"History’s written by winners—and winners love scapegoats."

Preston and Donovan held their breath, praying the discussion stayed philosophical.

But then—

"Wait, WHO is that actress? That’s not Evelyn!"
"Julian’s playing King Haris, so shouldn’t Evelyn be Coga?"
"Didn’t she quit acting after that CEO scandal?"
"Yeah, his wife leaked her tapes online. She got crucified and vanished!"
"Why would Team A-list hire her? She’s radioactive!"

Backstage, Lillian Graves stared at the actress—once blacklisted, now center stage. She remembered her desperate pleas, how no one believed her. The depression. The suicide attempts.

And yet—her acting had always been electric.

The internet only remembered the scandal.

But tonight?

She was rewriting her story.
###Chapter 133 - The Weight of a Smile

The stage came alive with the legendary tale of King Nathan toying with the feudal lords to win Evelyn’s elusive smile.

The performance followed the same dramatic style as the previous act. The actress playing Evelyn was breathtaking—though she had left the industry years ago, her beauty remained untouched beneath the artful makeup. She leaned against the windowsill, her expression heavy with sorrow, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. She embodied melancholy, like a caged bird longing for freedom.

As Julian, portraying King Nathan, passed by, his brow furrowed in frustration. "How can I make my beloved smile?"

A scheming vassal stepped forward, suggesting a grand spectacle—lighting the beacon fires to summon the lords, believing the absurdity would amuse her.

King Nathan considered it, then burst into laughter. "Brilliant!" he declared, sealing Evelyn’s fate.

Soon, she was led onto a towering platform, her distress palpable as King Nathan held her close, whispering empty comforts. Her entire posture screamed helplessness.

Then—the fires blazed. The thunder of hooves shook the earth as the lords arrived in a frenzy, demanding to know the enemy’s location.

But atop the platform, only King Nathan’s laughter echoed, joined by his treacherous courtiers.

Evelyn stared at the chaos below, stunned. She didn’t understand the significance of the beacons. All she felt was the suffocating weight of judgment from the furious men beneath her.

"My love, I arranged this for you," King Nathan murmured. "Why aren’t you laughing?"

Panic clawed at her throat. The situation was dire, yet the king expected amusement. So, she forced a brittle smile.

The moment she did, the lords realized they’d been deceived. Some erupted in fury, demanding answers.

King Nathan, ever the fool, merely grinned. "To amuse my queen is your honor."

Evelyn’s face drained of color. Below, countless eyes burned into her—accusing, condemning.

"You bewitched the king into this madness!"

The accusations rained down, branding her the downfall of a nation. The screen behind her lit up with centuries of historical slander:

She ruined Harisor. Beauty is a curse.

The stage darkened, a single spotlight illuminating Evelyn as she staggered to her feet, trembling.

"No… it wasn’t me!" she cried, voice breaking. "I was taken from my home, forced into this life. I never asked for this! I smiled because he demanded it—because everyone else laughed. And now I bear the blame?"

Her grief was raw, each word soaked in tears. The audience was spellbound. Compared to Evelyn’s earlier performance, this was masterful—every sob, every tremor, pulling them into her despair.

The live chat erupted.

"She’s incredible. If she hadn’t left the industry, she’d be a legend by now."

"Wait—wasn’t she the one caught in that scandal years ago?"

"The CEO’s wife destroyed her career over a lie!"

"This feels intentional. Team A-list is making a statement."

Then—a bombshell post surfaced, exposing the truth behind her downfall.

Years ago, a powerful CEO had pursued her, investing in films to lure her in. When she rejected him, he framed her, releasing manipulated footage that ruined her reputation. The wife, furious, had branded her a homewrecker.

But now—evidence proved she was coerced. The CEO had nearly bankrupted his own company with reckless investments, yet she bore the blame.

Sound familiar?

The parallels to King Nathan’s folly were undeniable.

The chat shifted.

"So she’s just like Evelyn—condemned for a man’s mistakes."

"Trust Evelyn. Something’s not right here."

On stage, Evelyn snatched up a bow, her tears glinting in the light as she aimed at the screen.

"I may be beautiful," she whispered, voice steel. "But I am no curse."

The arrow flew.

Silence. Then—applause.

The truth was out. And the world would never see her the same way again.

Live Chat Reactions:

"This changes everything."

"They set her up."

"Justice for Evelyn!"

The curtain fell. But the storm was just beginning.
###Chapter 134: A Night That Shook Hollywood

If the leaked documents were authentic, her final statement appeared directed at those who had forced her out of the industry years ago. No wonder her words carried such raw emotion. What a grave miscarriage of justice!

When someone dared to expose this now, it had to be the undeniable truth.

All the evidence was right there—so why had it remained buried until this moment? Had she lacked powerful allies before? Even if she'd spoken up earlier, would the corrupt have silenced her again? But now... now she had the full might of Truth Seeker behind her.

"You've guessed correctly," one netizen posted. "I dug up an old police report filed by an actress, but with insufficient evidence, the case went cold. The media blackout was so thorough most never even heard about it. Those who did dismissed it as attention-seeking drama. When even the legal system fails you, how can one woman stand against public opinion alone?"

"I never criticized her back then," another commented. "That puts me in the top 10% of decent netizens, doesn't it? Even then, the story never added up—how could one minor actress possibly tank an entire corporation? The math wasn't mathing."

Some truths remain eternal throughout history. When men fail, they blame women.

Shifting blame to external factors invites scrutiny of one's incompetence. But pinning it on a woman? That's foolproof. After all, don't men commit all sins for love of women?

"As a financial analyst, she made the perfect scapegoat," a professional weighed in. "Those failed film investments weren't what nearly bankrupted the company—their terrible management was. The movie flops just provided convenient cover for the CEO to save face."

The revelations kept coming. More C-list actresses came forward with allegations against the mogul. A serial predator, it seemed!

"I want to chop my typing fingers off," one horrified user posted. "I'd just gone to the CEO's wife's social media to show support. How could she be so vile? Her husband drugs women, and she destroys reputations. A villainous match made in hell. They must be stopped!"

The company's stock ticker was identified. Publicly traded? "Friends, can we allow this predator's empire to thrive? Hell no!"

Within hours, every corporate social media account drowned in outrage. Employees relaxing at home received frantic calls—damage control, now! But no PR statement could stem the tide against Truth Seeker and Team Elite's coordinated assault. The executives now tasted the same helplessness their victim had endured years ago.

The CEO's wife sat frozen, phone trembling in her hands. The door burst open as her husband stormed in, striking her across the face. "You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you?" he roared. "Your petty vengeance backfired spectacularly. We're !"

Meanwhile, the livestream chat flooded with apologies to the wronged actress.

Genevieve and Donovan exchanged relieved glances. They'd anticipated chaos but not this swift, decisive turn. Team Elite's narrative control was masterful—leveraging the live broadcast's reach to completely muzzle opposition. Every counterattack had been anticipated and dismantled. Their casting choices for supporting roles now made perfect sense.

As for the remaining players...

Act Three depicted Pompey using Cleopatra as justification for rebellion, ultimately leading to her tragic demise.

Act Four showed Bahamut, consumed by passion for Kasiya, making catastrophic military decisions in jealous rage.

The pattern was clear across all acts—the "femme fatale" trope was pure myth. Throughout history, countless rulers surrounded themselves with beautiful women without their kingdoms collapsing. Beauty was never the root cause of downfall.

While the live audience focused on the performance, online spectators multitasked furiously between streams and trending topics. Platform servers crashed repeatedly under the traffic surge.

Netizens self-organized into investigative teams—gathering evidence, debunking lies, corroborating anonymous tips. Together, they unearthed long-buried truths.

That night, from Hollywood insiders to elite families, phones rang nonstop across the nation. Some scrambled to contain damage, others made threats. Pleas, bribes, and panic filled the air.

"Look at this, Evelyn!" Genevieve exclaimed, shoving her phone forward whenever she found something juicy.

"Damn, did Team Elite recruit these wronged actresses for reputation rehab? This is basically pro bono justice work!"

"Perfectly aligns with tonight's theme while doing actual good," another fan commented. "Plus it covers for Evelyn's weaker scenes. Joining her fandom was the right call—I've contributed to so much justice tonight!"

Evelyn mused, Truth Seeker might actually be decent people. But full credit went to Isabelle Laurent for unearthing these cases with such meticulous evidence. A true triple play—clearing names, elevating the performance, and recruiting fresh talent.

She recalled how Marcus Donovan had tearfully begged Isabelle not to burn every bridge in Hollywood. But the fearless manager stood firm. Probably ties back to my agreement to support Violet Carter, Evelyn guessed. Ultimately, Julian Blackwood made the final call. Seeing these results, Marcus had nothing to complain about.

Best part? Fewer lines to memorize with several scenes cut. Though Julian's earlier glare suggested he despised slackers.

Now changed into modern attire, Evelyn prepared for her next scene when Isabelle approached. "You're on in five. More live acts coming."

"How's Violet holding up?" Evelyn asked.

Isabelle sighed. "I'd hoped these acts might rehab her image enough for a comeback. But improv proves too challenging. Still, I've paved the way—signing her later shouldn't be hard."

Evelyn nodded absently until she spotted Violet still feverishly making calls backstage. The woman's face burned with defiant fury.

A pang of guilt struck Evelyn. She shot Isabelle an apologetic glance before taking the stage.

The lights flickered.

Before delivering a single line—a cry rang out as Evelyn tumbled off the platform.
###Chapter 135 - Could You Take My Place On Stage?

The unexpected twist abruptly cut the live broadcast short, cameras quickly panning to the judging panel. The host swiftly intervened, flashing a practiced smile. "A minor technical difficulty, folks! We'll give Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Blackwood a moment to regroup. Meanwhile, let's hear our judges' thoughts on tonight's performances—we've certainly had some spectacular surprises!"

As the camera focused on the judges—who'd just received urgent whispers from Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe—the internet exploded. Live chat comments scrolled furiously:

What happened to Evelyn?! Is she okay?
This production is cursed! First the mic issues, now this!
I swear if they cut her performance short after that epic courtroom scene...
Team Elite just exposed half of Hollywood's skeletons tonight!
Someone check if the industry execs are having heart attacks backstage!

Backstage, chaos reigned—except for the Blackwood family, who formed a protective circle around Evelyn. Nathan reached her first, his hands hovering uncertainly as Margaret Blackwood fretted, "Sweetheart, where does it hurt?"

Evelyn bit her lip, guilt twisting her stomach. God, I hate lying to them... "Just my ankle," she murmured. "I don't think I can walk properly."

Julian immediately moved to carry her, while Sophia Blackwood checked for other injuries. "We're taking you to the hospital," Richard Blackwood declared, already pulling out his phone.

"No, really, it's not that bad—" Evelyn protested, but the Blackwoods had already shifted into crisis mode. Across the room, Isabelle Laurent fumed silently. She could at least tough it out for the finale!

Preston and Donovan arrived, faces pale. "The network's breathing down our necks," Preston whispered. "Can the show go on?"

Evelyn saw their desperation and had an idea. "We'll find a replacement," she promised.

Donovan's eyes widened. "Who could possibly—"

At that moment, Rebecca Yancey appeared in the doorway, concern etching her features. Evelyn's smile turned feline. "Perfect timing."

Every head swiveled toward the newcomer. Isabelle's jaw dropped as realization struck. Oh. My. God.

"Ms. Yancey," Evelyn said sweetly, wincing for effect. "I'm afraid I can't perform. Would you... take my place tonight?"

The backstage crew froze mid-bite on their snacks. Rebecca blinked as if struck. "Excuse me?"

Nathan's lips twitched. Clever girl. The Blackwoods exchanged knowing glances—their daughter-in-law had just set the stage for the performance of a lifetime.

###Chapter 136: Through Fire and Flame

Evelyn Sinclair moved swiftly, grasping Violet Carter's hand with urgency. "We're in desperate need of someone to save our stage play," she confessed. "Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe made it clear—if we can't find a replacement, they'll cancel our team's performance. Why don't you step in? There's no rule against inviting a competitor as a supporting actor."

A thoughtful pause. Then, with growing conviction, Evelyn added, "Besides, the fact that you were bold enough to seek a last-minute replacement shows you thrive under pressure. You can handle this, can't you?"

Her gaze flickered toward Seraphina Delacroix, suspicion creeping in. Was this really just coincidence?

Seraphina's laughter was tinged with guilt. "Evelyn's right, Ms. Carter. This is your moment to prove yourself!"

Violet had been dazed, but those words—prove yourself—ignited something in her. She had begged, pleaded, refused to surrender, all for one chance to shine.

Nathan Blackwood had stolen her last opportunity, but fate had handed her another.

Improvising didn’t scare her. What terrified her was never getting on stage at all.

The idea was absurd, but after witnessing Team A-List defy the impossible all night, Violet felt an unstoppable fire. Ambition burned in her eyes as she locked onto Seraphina. "Is this real? You'd let me take your place?"

"Just tell us—can you do it?" Evelyn challenged with a smirk.

Violet nodded frantically, terrified the offer would vanish. She was a woman who seized every opportunity, no matter how wild.

Without another word, Evelyn thrust the script for the final five acts into her hands. There was barely enough time to skim it.

Backstage, the crew watched them like they’d lost their minds.

The tension was suffocating.

Then Julian Blackwood finally snapped. "Hey—"

All eyes turned to him.

His expression twisted, words caught in his throat.

"I believe in you," Seraphina declared. "If this goes wrong, I'll take the blame."

"Mr. Blackwood is a professional!" Evelyn remembered their key player. "Just follow his lead. Even if the rest falters, the first half was strong enough."

The Blackwood family exchanged glances, far more intrigued by the unfolding drama than concerned about Julian’s feelings. The online chaos this would cause? Priceless.

"Do your best!" they cheered.

Julian thought, Damn it all.

Violet, now clutching the script, was oblivious to the outside world. She stood frozen, devouring every word, until Evelyn dragged her to the makeup chair. The artist worked swiftly as Violet remained laser-focused, absorbing the script like her life depended on it.

She didn’t ask if this meant a contract. She didn’t hesitate.

Team A-List was stunned.

The final act, after all, was loosely based on the very scandals used to vilify Violet.

But Violet was beyond caring. Her world had narrowed to the script and the stage.

She would not fail.

Ten minutes later, word reached Marcus Donovan, who rushed to inform Nathan.

Nathan, sipping coffee while waiting for Violet’s surrender, nearly choked. He stormed off to confront Preston and Donovan. This was insanity!

But the directors had already surrendered to fate.

After everything they’d endured, swapping an actress for a rival was nothing.

Still, watching Violet prepare, anxiety gnawed at them. She had minutes to prepare—no rehearsal, no cues, just raw improvisation alongside Julian.

Nathan’s face darkened. He slipped to the stage’s edge, desperate to intercept her. Helping the competition? Had she lost her mind?

But Violet and Julian were already waiting in the wings.

"Just follow the script," Violet whispered nervously. "I’ll keep up."

Julian studied her. "This is a team effort. The pressure isn’t just on you."

"Thank you. I won’t let you down."

Then she spotted Nathan and Marcus. Her lips curled into a defiant smirk.

Try to break me now.

The host announced the show’s return.

The live stream exploded.

Wait—Violet Carter is replacing Seraphina?!

So the delay wasn’t her chickening out—it was Mr. Blackwood’s fault?!

Since when do rivals help each other?!

Is this some kind of trap? A humiliation tactic?

Or… is Team A-List exposing the truth?

How is she supposed to perform with zero prep?!

If she pulls this off, doesn’t that prove the rumors were lies?

The debate raged as the lights dimmed.

The stage awaited.

And Violet stepped into the spotlight.
###Chapter 137 - Reading Juicy Gossip in Her Mind
Scoop Evelyn Up

Nathan and Julian stormed backstage, their faces dark with fury. As they passed the dressing rooms, Isabelle Laurent called out cheerfully, "Mr. Blackwood, how's your health?"

Normally unflappable, Nathan was visibly struggling to keep his composure. He shot Isabelle a withering glare, as if blaming her for stirring unnecessary trouble.

"Oh dear, that expression says it all. Still not feeling well? Should we call an ambulance?" Evelyn feigned concern, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Nathan ignored her completely, striding away without a word.

Julian's gaze was equally stormy. That cunning little witch slipped through our fingers again. And if this is true, does that mean Uncle Nathan won't get his divorce after all?

With a final scowl, Julian followed his uncle out.

Evelyn caught their expressions and smirked in triumph.

It's rare to see Isabelle so flustered. Then again, what Nathan did was truly despicable.

Turning back to the group, Isabelle remarked, "Well, that turned out better than expected."

Evelyn beamed. Of course it did. I wanted Nathan to overreach and end up worse off.

Though inwardly smug, she kept her expression neutral, not wanting to arouse suspicion.

Meanwhile, the Blackwoods remained with Evelyn, recalling the reason for the performance order change. Relief and triumph surged through them.

As Isabelle pulled out her laptop to monitor the online backlash, she explained, "Originally, we planned to wait until Seraphina's play ended before addressing the smear campaign and clearing her name. Now, we've saved ourselves the trouble."

Genevieve tilted her head. "So you don't need to defend her anymore?"

"Thanks to the momentum we've built, people will dig up dirt on Seraphina based on her performance in those five acts. Even without evidence for the next five, netizens will scrutinize everything from a new angle," Isabelle replied, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Her lips curled coldly. "And right on cue, here they come."

The group buzzed with curiosity, but seeing Isabelle's focused excitement, they knew a major move was underway and didn't press for details.

Evelyn, however, quickly pieced it together.

Those fools can't stand seeing Seraphina succeed. The moment there's a chance to clear her name, they start screeching like banshees.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. The smear campaign group?

They're nobodies. How dare they play victims? They've never known real justice. Go on, Isabelle—crush them!

Soon, they realized Seraphina's school days were being dredged up again.

These people, who'd once stood on moral high ground to attack Seraphina, couldn't bear the thought of her vindication. If she were cleared, they'd become the villains.

Isabelle was a pro at handling this—leaking scandals, hiring ghostwriters, and manipulating public opinion.

In truth, perspective shaped history.

If Seraphina were framed as malicious, everything would be blamed on her. But with goodwill? The narrative would flip entirely.

Isabelle just needed to release the full story, leaving no room for twisted interpretations. The public would do the rest.

"Maybe we can arrange a perfect ending," Isabelle mused.

Evelyn perked up. "Are you planning to invite Seraphina for a live agency signing after the performance?"

Another voice chimed in: Can't you see? Evelyn and Julian are backing Seraphina—remember who they are. We can't afford to cross them.

One suggested: Let's see how Seraphina performs first. If she fails, the internet will tear her apart without our help.

Another urged: Mrs. Blackwood, say something!

Margaret's response was icy: Look what happened to the others. It's her or us. Mobilize everything—nail Seraphina down for good, or we're .

A flood of ghostwriters began posting inflammatory comments, and trolls invaded the livestream. But with so many neutral viewers watching, their impact was minimal.

"No need to explain. Many have already reached out," the other side replied coolly.

After all, Seraphina had made too many enemies that night. The fallout was inevitable.

Julian couldn't take calls onstage, and few had Evelyn's number.

So, they called the only other person who could handle this.

Nathan ignored his buzzing phone and pushed through the backstage door. His eyes locked onto Evelyn, who was laughing while typing on her phone, watching the livestream. She seemed fine.

Nathan exhaled in relief and strode toward her.

The remaining staff members perked up at the sight of this imposing, disheveled man heading straight for Evelyn. Their gossip radar pinged—forget Seraphina, this was juicier.

They'd wondered if Evelyn was involved with Julian, given how close the Blackwoods were to her. But now, with this even more striking man appearing? The speculation went wild.

"Evelyn!" Nathan's voice was tense.

She turned, surprised. "Nathan? What are you doing here?"

Tonight, he looked different—his usually pristine suit rumpled from running, hair slightly mussed. His intense gaze dropped to her feet, propped on a footrest. He couldn't tell which was injured.

"I saw you fall during the livestream. Dad said you hurt your foot. Since the play's under control, I'm taking you to the hospital."

Without waiting for a reply, he reached for her, ready to scoop her into his arms.
###Chapter 138: Did You Have Fun Tonight?

Evelyn gasped in surprise and quickly pushed Nathan's shoulder away, forcing an awkward laugh. "No, no, it's fine! Just a little twist—nothing serious. I've had worse before. It'll heal on its own."

Nathan frowned, ready to scold her for being reckless with her own well-being.

Damn it. One lie leads to a hundred more.

He froze mid-thought, studying Evelyn's uneasy expression.

With a sigh, he relented under her insistent shove. "Are you sure it's nothing?"

Evelyn plastered on a smile. "Absolutely. I jumped on my own—how bad could it be?"

Nathan paused, realization dawning. His lips twitched—half amused, half exasperated. But he didn’t call her out.

Then he remembered Richard’s message, and his expression darkened. "Why are you alone? Where’s everyone else?"

Evelyn shrugged, just as confused. Richard and Margaret had suddenly herded everyone toward the stage performance.

She’d expected at least Lillian to stay with her—the supposed victim—but Genevieve had dragged her away too. So here she was, left to enjoy the drama by herself.

Not that she minded.

She explained to Nathan, whose expression shifted subtly. With a resigned sigh, he pulled up a chair beside her.

"Are you sure you don’t need a doctor? Even a little pain—we could get some ointment."

The stage was a meter high. Jumping off carelessly could actually hurt someone.

Evelyn shook her head firmly. As she spoke, his phone buzzed again.

"Are you busy? Am I keeping you from work?" she asked.

Since his arm healed, Nathan had thrown himself back into overtime. The fact that he’d rushed here for this made guilt twist in her chest.

Nathan dismissed it with a wave. "It’s nothing." He pulled out his phone.

He’d driven over in such a hurry he hadn’t checked his messages.

The caller’s intent didn’t surprise him—he’d already fielded several similar calls at the office.

Evelyn caught the words Julian and performance, curiosity piqued.

Nathan glanced at her, then answered coolly, "My wife and brother know exactly what they’re doing. I have no objections. If someone got hurt, maybe they should look in the mirror. What does that have to do with them? Yes, I support them completely."

The other end went silent—likely fuming—before Nathan politely ended the call.

When he looked up, Evelyn’s eyes sparkled with excitement, making his pulse skip. His gaze softened.

"Did you have fun tonight?"

Evelyn couldn’t resist gushing. Nathan was always the perfect audience.

"Look at Seraphina’s performance! Can you believe she only glanced at the script for ten minutes? The live chat is losing it. I can see their jaws hitting the floor."

Nathan chuckled, leaning in to watch the stream. "She’s a professional. Your agency just gained a powerhouse."

"But Isabelle’s still a little worried…"

On screen, Seraphina played a nervous new hire—strikingly beautiful but with wide, innocent eyes and stiff, awkward movements that screamed inexperience.

Most knew her as the sultry seductress typecast by directors who never gave her range. Tonight? She shattered that image effortlessly.

Julian and the supporting cast had prepared for disasters—but from the first line, Seraphina barely faltered. Any deviations? Same meaning, same impact.

In the first scene, her character had to discuss a contract with her boss during a business trip.

The audience watched her stammer into the phone, desperate to get every detail right.

Then—

"Huh?"

Her face twisted in confusion, torn between professionalism and discomfort.

Entering the hotel room, she froze at the sight of Julian in a robe. She held the contract at arm’s length, eager to leave—but he beckoned her closer. "Bring it here."

She startled, trying to retreat, but he kept pulling her back, scolding her for overreacting—while he was the one crossing lines.

Back at the office, a woman stormed up and slapped her. "You shameless bitch! Using work to seduce my husband!"

Seraphina stood stunned, whispers closing in.

She covered her ears, voice breaking. "I didn’t… I’m the victim…"

Then—

She screamed, still in character, and slapped them both back.

"He abused his power! Why blame me? Because I’m pretty? Because I’m a woman? Is that why you think you can bully me? You’d rather attack me than face the truth!"

Panting, trembling—every ounce of her radiated years of pent-up fury and injustice.

Not a single tear fell, but her silent agony was devastating. Even the seasoned actors onstage were stunned.

The audience erupted.

Trolls hired to trash the stream drowned in praise.

In a nursing home, medical staff gaped at the screen. They knew Seraphina was kind—but her personal life? A mystery.

They’d tuned in to support her grandmother, Harriet.

None expected this.

A weak hand rose from the bed. Harriet’s eyes shone with tears—but she smiled, pointing proudly.

"That’s my granddaughter. The best."


###Chapter 139: The Viral Truth Exposed

The live chat exploded with reactions as the performance unfolded.

"Holy hell, I just got chills!" one viewer typed.

"This can't be improvised! Evelyn Sinclair just delivered that like she lived it!" another commented.

The skepticism grew: "You call this off-script? Ms. Whitmore, you’re making every other actor look like amateurs! Should they all go back to acting school?"

A fan confessed: "Sorry, Seraphina, but I’ve found my new obsession. Evelyn, you’re a revelation!"

Disbelief ran rampant: "No freaking way! How is someone this stunning AND this talented without formal training? I must be dreaming—someone slap me!"

A reply followed: "Did it work?"

"My cheek’s red, and nope—still real. Your Highness, I’m officially stanning!"

The praise kept coming: "An undiscovered gem! How did Hollywood miss her? She’s been right here, and nobody noticed?"

But the real impact lay deeper. "This storyline hits too close to home," a user shared. "I was gaslit into thinking I ‘led on’ my boss. His wife threatened me, coworkers ghosted me. I quit because the system protects predators."

Another echoed: "I kneed my harasser in the groin. But I get why some freeze—we’re taught to ‘be polite’ even when we’re screaming inside."

A male ally chimed in: "Ladies, raise hell. These cowards only back down when you fight back."

Then, the bombshells dropped.

"Wait… this parallels that viral scandal last year! The one with the ‘homewrecker’ accusations?"

"The RV incident! The photos were so blurry—just like Evelyn’s ‘evidence’ was nonexistent!"

"We were played. That wasn’t journalism; it was a witch hunt."

The accused wives panicked as their socials flooded. Their husbands trended—#Canceled. No PR spin could stop the backlash. Even their loyalists wavered.

Some men threw their spouses under the bus: "I had no part in this! She ran her mouth alone!"

But the truth was out.

"You vile hypocrite!" a mother raged online. "My daughter begged to quit your ‘tutoring.’ Now I know why—you’re a predator!"

Another exposed a lie: "Fired for ‘bad attitude’? Please. You bullied Evelyn because boys liked her. You’re the reason your friend transferred, not her."

The darkest secret unraveled: "That ‘suicide’ case? Their son was obsessed. Evelyn never spoke to him. They destroyed her to hide their own neglect."

A psychologist verified: "They ignored his depression, then blamed a stranger for their failure."

Karma arrived swiftly. "Heard they totaled their car last week. Coincidence?"

Meanwhile, sharp-eyed fans dug deeper.

Why did Evelyn’s agency never defend her? Why did it take a competition to clear her name?

An insider leaked contract details—10 years, slave wages, while others earned millions.

"This is illegal. Time to audit their taxes," a lawyer tweeted.

The agency scrambled, but Evelyn, drained from her tour-de-force performance, slept backstage, oblivious to the storm she’d unleashed.

Her fate had already changed.

###Chapter 140: A Reputation in Ruins

Backstage, Isabelle Laurent stood protectively beside Seraphina Delacroix, her expression one of quiet pride. She had finally found a rising star worth investing in, and she wasn’t about to let anyone disrupt her protégé’s moment.

The online buzz was even more explosive than Isabelle had hoped—all thanks to Seraphina’s groundbreaking performance.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood family had arrived, their eyes lighting up at the sight of Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood seated together.

Julian Blackwood leaned against the wall, exhaustion lining his features as he spoke to Nathan in hushed tones. He wasn’t blind—someone had clearly gotten to Nathan.

Nathan merely gave him a reassuring nod. “Don’t worry.”

Evelyn, on the other hand, was deep in whispered gossip with the Blackwood women, dissecting the latest online scandal.

Just then, the insufferable Gabriel Ramirez and his sidekick, Vincent Holloway, approached.

All eyes turned toward them, barely containing their amusement at the impending drama.

Look at that ghostly complexion—paler than a corpse left out in the sun. Gabriel must not have expected Seraphina’s performance to be this flawless. Talent always wins in the end.

The Blackwoods exchanged knowing glances—Gabriel did look like he’d seen a ghost.

But before he could reach Seraphina, Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe intercepted him.

“Mr. Ramirez, we’ve been looking for you,” Preston said smoothly.

Gabriel stiffened, remembering what was coming. Steeling himself, he stepped forward. “I believe we should take the stage—”

The challenge had been issued. Seraphina had already turned the tables, and Gabriel had no choice but to engage.

If he backed out now, it would only make him look worse. His fists clenched—he wanted to tear that smug woman apart, but he had to play the game.

Donovan cut him off with a sharp smile. “Mr. Ramirez, you won’t be going on stage.”

Gabriel’s expression froze. “Excuse me? This is a competition.”

“Ms. Delacroix is clearly exhausted,” Preston said coolly. “She doesn’t need to perform again.”

Gabriel’s face darkened. He opened his mouth to argue, but Donovan was faster.

“We’ve already adjusted the show based on audience expectations. Besides, you were the one who refused to perform earlier. We can’t cater to your whims.”

The spectators nearly burst into laughter.

The audacity! They don’t owe you anything. Just because you’re ready now doesn’t mean they have to indulge you. And Preston and Donovan aren’t fools—they see right through your little power play.

The Blackwoods listened to Evelyn’s muttered complaints, struggling to keep their composure.

The scrutiny was too much. Gabriel’s face burned with humiliation. “What is this? Are you saying I won’t be appearing in any future broadcasts?”

He was bluffing, trying to force their hand.

Preston and Donovan stared at him, their expressions unreadable. Their silence spoke volumes—Go ahead. Walk away. See if we care.

Using withdrawal as a threat? Pathetic. He’ll realize soon enough that the audience has already turned against him. The backlash is coming, and it won’t be pretty.

The Blackwoods, initially just amused bystanders, grew curious. How had things escalated so quickly?

Gabriel had always maintained a polished facade. The public shouldn’t know about his dirty laundry yet.

But Evelyn was too busy reveling in his downfall to explain.

They pulled out their phones, searching for answers.

The truth was already spreading like wildfire.

One comment mocked: Oh, please. Don’t tell me you’re about to blame Seraphina for seducing your precious Gabriel, leading to your divorce. Hilarious! With her talent and looks, why would she ever settle for him? For his receding hairline? His mediocre career?

Another read: Gabriel was the one obsessed with Seraphina. What does that have to do with her?

A third sneered: You couldn’t keep your man in check, so you take it out on innocent women? Pathetic.

Then came the bombshell—someone had leaked the original script Seraphina was supposed to perform.

It was a poignant tale of love and loyalty, a story of sacrifice and devotion. A far cry from the scandalous narrative Gabriel and his wife, Claire Harrison, had tried to spin.

The leaked footage Claire had orchestrated painted Seraphina as a scheming mistress, manipulating Gabriel while tormenting his wife. But now, with the script exposed, the truth was undeniable.

Every detail matched—proving Claire had been part of the smear campaign all along.

Justice served. This is what happens when you try to ruin someone’s reputation.

Claire, watching the flood of insults, finally cracked. She never imagined she’d become the target of a cyber witch hunt. Even her family background was being dragged through the mud.

Pale and shaking, she reached for her phone to call Gabriel.

But the internet had already moved on—speculating why Gabriel hadn’t taken the stage.

One user theorized: Did he plan to propose to Seraphina after his divorce, got rejected, and decided to punish her?

Another scoffed: We’ve been outside the studio the whole time. No ambulance, no sign of him. “Too sick to perform”? Yeah, right.

A third chimed in: Ew. Old man, stay in your lane.

Claire could only watch, speechless, as the comments rolled in.

Meanwhile, Gabriel was still making a scene, demanding to perform.

Julian, scrolling through the chaos, smirked. “Mr. Ramirez, you might want to check the public opinion. Keeping you off stage is for your own good. Preston’s saving what’s left of your dignity.”

Gabriel froze, then frantically pulled out his phone.

His face went white.

The damage was done.


###Chapter 141: The Mask Slips Off

Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood had long grown indifferent to the online chaos, barely glancing at social media anymore. With Gordon Gonzales effectively barred from the stage, they turned their attention to Isabelle Laurent, discussing the final arrangements for the evening.

Meanwhile, Gordon was unraveling at the seams.

His decision to divorce and remarry had once filled him with self-righteous conviction. But now, as the internet erupted with scathing critiques and merciless mockery, the weight of public scorn crushed him. The polished facade he’d maintained for years was crumbling, exposing the coward beneath.

Worse, netizens had already dissected his intentions from that ill-fated evening, branding him a hypocrite.

Losing his dignity in his twilight years was a humiliation he’d never anticipated.

This middle-aged man, coddled by his wife for decades, had been blind to his own foolishness, mistaking recklessness for romance. Now, regret twisted his stomach into knots, leaving him unsteady on his feet.

Evelyn smirked inwardly. Look at him, sweating bullets. Did he really think he could walk away unscathed?

The Blackwoods shared the sentiment. Even if tonight’s scandal hadn’t erupted, they knew Gordon would’ve thrown Rebecca under the bus the moment public opinion turned against him. Self-preservation was his only true loyalty.

Suddenly, Gordon lunged toward Rebecca’s resting area like a desperate man grasping at straws.

Evelyn’s mental scoff was immediate. Oh, now he wants her to clean up his mess? Pathetic.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. No shame at all.

Despite their disgust, they moved to intercept him.

Isabelle, mid-conversation with Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe, reacted instantly, stepping into Gordon’s path.

Gordon’s smile was strained, his voice tight. "I need to speak with Rebecca. It’s urgent."

Isabelle offered a razor-thin smile. "The performance is canceled. There’s nothing left to discuss. Ms. Yancey needs rest before the supporting actresses’ interviews. You, however, should focus on damage control—unless you enjoy being the internet’s favorite villain."

Gordon’s composure shattered. "What business is this of yours?"

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. He’s panicking. The mighty Gordon Gonzales, reduced to a sputtering mess.

Even the backstage crew watched with rapt attention, savoring the spectacle.

Isabelle arched a brow. "It’s our business now. Rebecca’s contract is nearly up, after all."

Gordon paled. He’d counted on Rebecca’s vulnerability—no contract, no allies. But now, surrounded by A-list power players, she was untouchable.

Defeated, Gordon slunk away, tail between his legs.

Simon, his nephew, trailed after him nervously. As a newcomer, he lacked the clout to intervene. When he caught Gordon’s furious phone call with Ruth, he froze, eavesdropping in dread. If their schemes unraveled, he’d be collateral damage.

"What have you done?" Gordon snarled, his refined veneer obliterated by rage.

Ruth, stunned by his ferocity, stammered, "I—I only meant to deal with Rebecca! This wasn’t supposed to happen!"

Gordon’s voice dripped with venom. "Fix this. Now. Or I’ll make sure you regret it."

A heavy silence followed. Finally, Ruth murmured, "We’ll talk at home."

Gordon exhaled. Good. She’ll handle it.

The irony wasn’t lost on Evelyn. Once, they’d feared Rebecca would cling to Gordon. Now, he was the desperate one.

As the actresses took the stage for interviews, the live chat exploded with praise. Yet some hesitated under the spotlight, their trauma from past scandals still raw.

The host smiled warmly. "Nervous? It’s been seven years, after all."

One actress nodded, her laugh tinged with relief. "Yes. Seven years."

"But your performance was flawless."

"Because I love acting," she said simply.

Unlike hollow industry platitudes, her words rang true. Only genuine passion could’ve reignited her talent after so long.

The host grinned. "The fans are begging for your comeback!"

Her smile softened, eyes glistening. "This role was a gift. Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Blackwood showed me that justice exists. I’ve retired, but if they ever need me, I’ll be there."

Evelyn’s chest warmed. This was why they fought.

###Chapter 142: Kisses From Goddesses

The moment the actress spoke those words, the live audience erupted in collective sighs of disappointment. The online chat exploded with frantic messages, each more desperate than the last.

When the other actresses echoed similar sentiments, the virtual space became a storm of heartbroken emojis and wailing GIFs.

It was a tragedy—so many brilliant actresses stepping away from the spotlight. Fans had hoped to see them grace the screens again.

Furious, netizens unleashed another wave of outrage against the vile predators lurking in the industry.

Even the host couldn’t hide his dismay. "Are you absolutely certain? After tonight, your careers could soar to new heights."

Anyone with eyes could see that Team A-list had paved a golden path for them. From now on, no smear campaign could tarnish their reputations.

In truth, Isabelle Laurent had approached them with contracts in hand. They were, after all, undeniable talents.

Yet, one by one, they declined. Perhaps they had found something more precious than fame.

The actress smiled softly. "No. My reason for being here was never about making a comeback."

The host caught the unusual glint in their eyes and leaned in. "Then what was it?"

The crowd held its breath.

The actresses exchanged knowing glances.

"We came forward to use our pain as armor for those who come after us," one said. "So no other woman has to suffer in silence. So the monsters hiding in the shadows can never touch them again."

Another actress smirked, borrowing the exact words once used to blacklist Evelyn. "Those who earn their roles through talent deserve respect. Those who use dirty tricks? Get out of this industry. You don’t belong here."

Silence.

Then—thunderous applause.

The chat exploded, no longer begging them to stay but repeating their words like a battle cry.

They were actresses, not playthings. Not trophies.

And though some chose the crooked path, most were victims of greed and power. Tonight, they reclaimed their voices.

As the spotlight shifted, it was time for the final supporting actress—Evelyn Sinclair—to take the stage.

The women onstage watched her with warm smiles, as if welcoming her onto the platform they had built together.

Evelyn met their gazes, her heart swelling. Their fates had once been the same.

With a soft smile, she turned and grabbed Lillian Graves, who was practically vibrating with excitement. Julian Blackwood followed close behind.

The trio stepped into the light.

The applause was deafening. The chat flooded with demands for Evelyn’s fandom to rise and reshape Hollywood.

During Evelyn’s interview, Julian seized the moment to extend an official invitation, sending the energy in the room skyrocketing.

Though Isabelle had already hinted at it, Evelyn still choked up. Tears welled in her eyes as she trembled. Then, without warning, she spun and hugged Lillian tightly.

The mood shifted instantly.

Suddenly, all the actresses swarmed Lillian, peppering her face with kisses. The poor girl turned scarlet, nearly forgetting to limp.

Lipstick smudged across her cheeks, she stumbled offstage, dizzy with euphoria.

I got kissed by goddesses! Men everywhere are weeping with envy right now.

"Margaret, take a picture!" she giggled.

The atmosphere was electric—but the Blackwoods noticed Nathan’s darkening expression.

His gaze locked onto the lipstick stains on Lillian’s face. The second Margaret snapped the photo, he swept her into his arms without warning.

Lillian yelped. "What are you—?!"

"The show’s over. Time to go home." His tone left no room for argument. "You’re injured. I’m carrying you."

"W-Wait—people are staring!"

"My foot feels better—I can walk!"

"Not happening."

And just like that, he marched out the emergency exit with her in his arms.

Lillian squirmed, but secretly? She was thrilled.

Kisses from goddesses AND a ride from a god? Best. Night. Ever.

Nathan paused mid-step. Oh. Right. He checked his phone.

Richard: He just left?
Margaret: Is this what they mean by "a son forgets his mother when he gets a girlfriend"? (Excited sticker)
Sophia: All Nate sees is Evie now. (Smiling sticker)

"They’re waiting for Julian. We’re leaving first."

At home, the mansion was quiet. Nathan carried Lillian all the way to her room, maintaining the charade until the very end.

Only when he set her on the bed did awkwardness finally creep in.

She laughed nervously. "Thanks! You can go now."

Nathan understood. He gave her space—but not before pausing at the door.

"You were incredible tonight."

Lillian blinked, unsure what he meant. Still, a smile tugged at her lips. "Yeah. I think so too."

With that, he left.

The so-called competition ended without a winner. But online? The chaos was just beginning.

Scandals erupted one after another—all exposing the same kind of filth. Each new revelation dragged the old ones back into the light. There was no escape.

Fan clubs turned their profile pictures black in protest. Some issued apologies; others doubled down. Reputations crumbled overnight.

It was a purge.

And those who escaped? They trembled in fear.

A few tried to exploit the chaos—but truth always prevailed.

At the Grant residence, Victor and Yvonne sat in tense silence.

After watching every failed attempt at damage control, Yvonne finally voiced her plan.

Victor paled. "Are you sure? If this backfires—"

"Trust me, darling." Her smile was razor-sharp. "I’ll handle everything."

###Chapter 143: Capturing Rebecca and Gordon's Scandal

The moment the show wrapped up, Evelyn Sinclair finally got her well-deserved break. For the next three days, she lounged at home, scrolling endlessly through the latest entertainment gossip, reveling in the chaos that had shaken the industry.

Her reputation as the Entertainment Industry's Truth-Teller had only grown more enigmatic.

In the Blackwood family’s living room, everyone was gathered, chatting animatedly.

Genevieve burst into laughter, shoving her phone in Evelyn’s face.

A fan’s comment read: "I thought Evelyn would be the first to fall, but turns out, it's everyone else. She’s got some serious mystical powers, huh?"

Evelyn blinked. Huh? Why are people saying that about me?

The Blackwoods exchanged knowing glances. Well, considering her system, it’s not entirely wrong.

"Look at this one," Sophia chimed in, grinning. "This person says they’ll only stan celebrities you befriend from now on. Otherwise, they risk emotional and financial damage when their faves inevitably crash and burn."

"Evelyn’s basically a trendsetter now," Margaret remarked with amusement.

Evelyn groaned. "My DMs are flooded with requests for ‘appraisals.’ I’ve turned into a damn fortune teller."

Honestly, celebrity worship is like marriage. Starts off great, but in the end, it all comes down to their conscience. Who knows who’ll disappoint us next?

The Blackwoods nodded in silent agreement.

"By the way," Margaret asked curiously, "is Rebecca officially signed under your agency now?"

Julian, who was building Legos with Theodore, checked his watch. "Pretty much. Isabelle is taking her to terminate her old contract today before signing with us officially."

"Don’t take advantage of her in the contract," Margaret couldn’t help but say. "That poor girl’s been through enough."

Richard and Margaret were both kind-hearted. They’d already arranged for Rebecca’s grandmother to be transferred to the best rehabilitation center under Blackwood Group’s care—handled by Sophia herself.

Julian rolled his eyes. "Do we look like we’re strapped for cash? Her contract’s generous and gives her plenty of freedom."

Evelyn smirked. "According to Isabelle, we’re grooming Rebecca for the silver screen. With her potential, she could become an international superstar. Her future’s limitless."

The family was relieved Rebecca had found her footing.

Just then, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen—a DM from her alternate Twitter account.

Are you free to take some photos?

She froze.

Oh right. I used this account to pose as a paparazzi, selling scoops to gossip blogs. Do they seriously think I’m a real pap?

At first, the Blackwoods didn’t pay much attention—until Evelyn’s inner monologue nearly shattered their eardrums. Everyone except Theodore flinched, hands instinctively covering their ears.

What the hell?

They want me to snap pics of Rebecca and Gordon having an affair at some hotel?!

The Blackwoods erupted. What kind of nonsense is this? Everyone knows Gordon and Ruth have been harassing Rebecca! She’s the victim here!

Wait—someone leaked info claiming Rebecca and Gordon will be in Room 143 at King Hotel tonight, and now gossip blogs are scrambling for paparazzi to get ‘exclusive’ shots. This is insane!

If this got out, it wouldn’t just ruin Rebecca—everyone who supported her, including Team A-list, would be dragged into the mess.

Evelyn could practically feel the other person’s excitement through the screen. For gossip blogs, explosive scandals were pure gold.

First, they’d release a teaser, then wait for the targets to panic and pay up. If the offer wasn’t good enough? Boom—photos go public.

Hah! Trying to ruin my ‘Truth-Teller’ rep? Dream on. Oh wait, I don’t even care about that. Whatever—I need to figure out what’s really going on.

Then, without warning, Evelyn’s thoughts exploded into a string of curses.

Those vile snakes! Gordon and Ruth are setting Rebecca up!

The Blackwoods were stunned. Since the scandal broke, neither Rebecca nor Gordon and Ruth had made statements, suggesting both sides wanted to let things die down.

Rebecca had no proof, and she knew better than to push her luck. She didn’t want to overplay the public’s sympathy.

As for Gordon and Ruth? If they had any sense, they’d lay low. Without evidence, the storm might pass. But no—they were doubling down.

They’re planning to drug Rebecca, stage an affair, and have paps capture it all. Ruth’s the one leaking this! It’s a setup to ‘prove’ Rebecca seduced Gordon, making Ruth the victim. Gordon’s disappearance? Oh, it was just him ‘rejecting’ Rebecca’s advances. With no proof of their blackmail, this twisted narrative plus scandalous photos would flip everything in their favor.

The Blackwoods were disgusted. They’d thought the couple was shameless, but this was downright evil.

Evelyn’s mind raced. Wait—Ruth’s a hopeless romantic. Would she really go this far? Is she planning to stop things before they escalate?

The family silently agreed. She better. Otherwise, that leech Gordon’s getting exactly what he wants.

But Evelyn wasn’t done.

Oh my god. Ruth told Gordon she’d intervene, but she’s planning to drug him too. She wants to turn this into a full-blown adultery scandal, ruining both Rebecca and Gordon. That way, she can chain Gordon to her forever. Wow. That’s some next-level scheming.

The Blackwoods’ minds reeled. This was like some twisted, middle-aged obsessive romance gone wrong.

Listen, lady, if you want to teach your gold-digging husband a lesson, go ahead. But dragging an innocent girl into this? Not cool.

The family turned to Evelyn. So… what now? We can’t just let this happen.

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed with determination.

Oh, we’re definitely crashing their little party.


###Chapter 144: The Wary Rebecca

Evelyn Sinclair fidgeted nervously in her seat, her fingers drumming against the tablecloth as she searched for an excuse to leave. Across from her, the Blackwood family exchanged uneasy glances, equally desperate to find a reason to depart.

Suddenly, Richard Blackwood's phone pinged. He feigned surprise as he read the message. "Nathan just texted. His friend's restaurant received a shipment of rare truffles tonight. He suggested we try them."

Margaret Blackwood immediately perked up. "Which establishment?"

"The Royal Chateau," Richard replied, simultaneously firing off a quick text to Nathan to coordinate their cover story.

Evelyn's breath hitched at the mention of the upscale hotel.

Sophia Blackwood didn't hesitate. "We should go immediately."

Genevieve nodded in enthusiastic agreement.

Before anyone could object, Julian had already pulled Theodore to his feet. "I'll have the cars brought around."

Only Theodore looked genuinely confused by the sudden flurry of activity.

Evelyn thought bitterly, "Of all the damn coincidences..."

The Blackwoods stiffened. Were they being too obvious?

Evelyn's inner monologue continued, "It's like fate itself is pushing us to save Rebecca!"

The family collectively exhaled in relief and sprang into action.

Meanwhile, Nathan Blackwood paused mid-signature when his phone buzzed. Reading Richard's message, he pinched the bridge of his nose before swiftly organizing his paperwork to join this impromptu family outing.

Their grand procession arrived at the discreet luxury hotel - a blessing given Julian and Evelyn's celebrity status that made disguises nearly useless against paparazzi.

As they lingered in the lobby under the staff's attentive care, Evelyn's thoughts rang clear in their minds: We made it just in time. They're still talking in the restaurant. The drug's already in the coffee, but thank God she hasn't drunk it yet.

Panic shot through the Blackwoods. Time was running out.

Following Evelyn's mental cues, they located the nearest semi-private booth. The restaurant's elegant partitions provided visual privacy while allowing voices to carry if one listened carefully.

Evelyn strained to hear any conversation, failing to notice the unnatural silence from Rebecca's table. She debated how to "accidentally" bump into Rebecca to prevent the coffee consumption if necessary.

Then Rebecca's cool, measured voice cut through the tension:

"Mrs. Ramirez, you've seen the evidence. There was never anything between your husband and me. The tabloid rumors are exactly that - rumors. I won't press charges if you cease this harassment. I've rebuilt my life and have no interest in further entanglement with either of you."

How vile, Evelyn thought. Claudia Bennett had blackmailed Rebecca into this meeting with threats of continued public attacks. Rebecca, not wanting to burden her agency, had come alone to handle it.

The Blackwoods frowned. Rebecca still hadn't learned that as a signed artist, she had an entire team to handle such matters. Her solitary approach worried them deeply.

"You scheming little bitch!" Claudia's voice turned shrill. "You ruined my marriage with those bedroom eyes and now play the victim? That face of yours is the problem!"

Rebecca's response came like a whip crack: "The fault lies with him and you, never with me!"

Love? Evelyn's thoughts scoffed. The kind where he uses filming schedules to avoid your bed for months? Or maybe the 'love' of a man who lives off your paychecks while criticizing your every flaw? Making you feel unworthy of his 'genius'? Darling, wake up - that man never loved you.

The Blackwoods exchanged startled glances. Could people truly delude themselves so completely?

Rebecca dismissed Claudia's ranting. "Your marital issues don't concern me. Just leave me out of it."

Damn! In his nervousness, Gabriel had already drunk several cups of the drugged tea Claudia prepared in their hotel room. He now lay slumped over the table, unconscious.

"You understand now, so I'll take my leave." Rebecca's tone softened slightly.

Claudia's laugh turned saccharine. "All this talking must have parched your throat, Ms. Monroe. Try this special coffee blend - exclusive to this hotel."

The Blackwoods tensed.

Evelyn half-rose to intervene when Rebecca's calm reply stopped her: "I'm afraid I must decline."

Evelyn froze mid-motion, slowly sinking back into her seat.

Claudia's voice sharpened. "Excuse me?"

Rebecca's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Early in my career, I received invaluable advice: Never consume anything that's left your sight."

Lightbulbs went off in the listeners' minds. The women especially noted this crucial safety tip.

For Rebecca, the untouched coffee before her - which she hadn't ordered - might as well have been poison.

Evelyn thought admiringly: I underestimated Rebecca. Years in this cutthroat industry taught her caution. Maybe she doesn't need rescuing after all.

Claudia's face twisted. "Ms. Monroe, I was trying to make peace, but you're being deliberately difficult!"

As if your reputation holds any weight, Evelyn scoffed silently, preparing to step in if Rebecca faltered.

Then Rebecca asked point-blank: "Did you put something in this coffee?"

Dead silence followed.

###Chapter 145: To Resist or Not

Damn it, how did she figure it out? Evelyn was genuinely shocked.

The Blackwood family exchanged stunned glances.

Ruth's composure nearly cracked for a split second before she snapped, "What nonsense are you spouting?"

Rebecca scoffed. "If there was truly nothing to hide, you'd be confused, not instantly defensive, Ruth. You're no actress—it takes real skill to fool someone in my profession. It was suspicious enough that you insisted on meeting me, but then you pushed me to drink something you prepared? If I weren't this alert, I'd have been exploited a dozen times over in this industry by now."

At that, Ruth's facade crumbled completely.

Rebecca held up the coffee cup. "I wanted to handle this peacefully, Mrs. Gonzales, but since you’ve chosen to play dirty, don’t blame me for what comes next."

She reached for her phone, ready to dial.

"Calling the police?" Ruth's voice turned shrill.

Hearing movement from the next booth, Evelyn shot to her feet. The Blackwoods followed suit, while nearby staff rushed over at the commotion.

Ruth lunged forward, desperate to snatch the cup.

Rebecca tried to bolt, but Ruth shoved her from behind.

Evelyn, being closest, caught Rebecca just in time—but the coffee cup slipped from her grasp, its contents arcing through the air before drenching someone head to toe.

The Blackwoods, still seated in their semi-circle, gaped at the newcomer.

Nathan stood frozen, his hair dripping with coffee, his sharp gaze locked onto the scene before him.

Both Ruth and Rebecca paled. They recognized him instantly—and neither had expected to run into Evelyn and the Blackwoods here.

What a disaster.

Evelyn steadied Rebecca, biting back an inappropriate laugh at Nathan’s disheveled state.

A single glance from him had her scrambling for a napkin. She dabbed at his face haphazardly, as if drying off a soaked kitten. Surprisingly, Nathan allowed it.

Ruth, recovering, realized the evidence was gone and exhaled in relief. She muttered a hasty apology before bolting.

Rebecca didn’t stop her. She knew arguing would be pointless—Ruth would deny everything. But she wasn’t defenseless. She’d secured a copy of the surveillance footage. If Ruth tried anything else, she’d use it.

"What a waste," the Blackwoods thought, eyeing the shattered cup. Still, they doubted Ruth would dare target Rebecca again.

Julian, ever the protective boss, warned Rebecca to involve her agent in future dealings. She nodded obediently before making her exit.

By then, the hotel manager had arrived, ushering Nathan upstairs to freshen up in the presidential suite.

Evelyn suddenly perked up. "Wait—could the residue on your clothes be tested for drugs?" She quickly explained what she’d overheard.

Nathan barely had time to process before her inner monologue hit him like a freight train:

Damn, what if he ingested some? His cheeks are flushed—is it the drug or the steam? If he loses control and pounces on me, do I fight back or just... not?

Nathan’s ears burned. He stole a glance at Evelyn.

After the divorce, I’ll never find someone this gorgeous again...

His chest tightened. Normally, her shameless thoughts annoyed him. Now, they stung.

No, no—taking advantage would be wrong. Focus. Check on the others.

A rush of heat flooded his head. Before he could stop himself, he closed the distance between them.

Evelyn blinked up at him. Oh. Oh.

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

To resist or not—that was the question.

###Chapter 146: The Fall of Uncle Gordon

An electrifying presence suddenly surrounded Evelyn. The intoxicating wave of masculine energy that hit her was so potent that her knees nearly buckled, her body instinctively arching backward.

Evelyn's sapphire eyes widened in shock as she watched Nathan slowly close the distance between them, her breath catching in her throat.

Nathan's gaze softened, his voice a velvet growl laced with dangerous allure. "Evelyn..."

"What?" Evelyn's hand flew up in surprise, her fingers accidentally brushing against Nathan's damp, sculpted chest through the parted bathrobe.

A surge of satisfaction coursed through Nathan. As expected—all bark and no bite. The moment things got real, his little wildcat turned into a trembling kitten.

He hadn't planned to do anything drastic. Just that sudden, irresistible urge to taste those parted lips... to witness those panicked doe eyes and fluttering lashes up close.

Wait a minute—didn't I just see that the coffee wasn't drugged after all? So Nathan shouldn't be under any influence... right? Then what the hell is he doing? Has he lost his damn mind?

Nathan watched with amusement as Evelyn's expression shifted from shock to suspicion. "Nathan, you—"

"Y-You're sitting on my shirt," Nathan blurted out, mentally kicking himself for the lame excuse.

Both froze.

Glancing down, Evelyn realized she'd indeed been perched on the corner of his freshly delivered dress shirt. With an awkward chuckle, she scooted aside. Nathan stood abruptly, feigning nonchalance as he grabbed his clothes.

Phew. That was close. I totally thought... cough What a shame—I was totally ready to take advantage of the situation.

Nathan smirked. Such a little hypocrite.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her racing heart, stealing glances as Nathan retreated to the bathroom. Only when the door clicked shut did she exhale in relief.

Then the earlier gossip resurfaced, hijacking her thoughts.

What the actual hell? Rebecca's coffee wasn't drugged? Someone switched the spiked drink, and now Mrs. Gonzales is the one affected?!

This plot twist... So the one with Ruth right now is... No. No no no! Ew!

Wait—technically they're not blood-related... But still! How could they?!

Even Nathan, now buttoning his shirt inside, grew intrigued. What fresh scandal is she concocting now?

Where was Gordon? Alone in his room, left to his own devices?

Nathan stepped out of the suite, only to find Evelyn crouched by the door, peeking through the slightly ajar entrance with mischievous curiosity.

Footsteps echoed outside. Without hesitation, Nathan positioned himself behind Evelyn, his presence silent but protective.

"Shh," Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips, signaling for silence.

A quick glance revealed a shadowy figure creeping through the hallway, carrying professional camera equipment. The intruder paused, scanning the doors before zeroing in on one particular room.

Then—chaos erupted.

A staged commotion broke out, complete with dramatic accusations of an illicit affair. The ruckus drew curious guests from neighboring rooms, their whispers filling the corridor.

"Wait—why are Mom and Dad here?" Evelyn gasped, instinctively stepping forward, only for Nathan to pull her back.

"Notice Julian’s absence?" Nathan murmured. "You’re a public figure now. One wrong photo could ruin you."

Evelyn’s lips trembled with indignation.

I should’ve been the first to know! Why does this always happen to me?

Nathan suppressed a smirk at her pout. Without a word, he grabbed his black jacket and draped it over her head, tucking her hair beneath the fabric.

"Won’t this make me stand out more?" she protested.

"Standing out doesn’t matter as long as your face isn’t captured," Nathan said smoothly. "And trust me, my photos don’t get leaked."

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled with sudden excitement. She adjusted the jacket, leaving only her eyes visible, then looked up at Nathan expectantly.

With practiced ease, Nathan wrapped an arm around her shoulders, shielding her against his side as they stepped into the hallway. The Blackwood family, witnessing their entrance, barely stifled their laughter—Nathan had never indulged in such theatrics before.

Meanwhile, Julian seethed behind another door, glaring at his brother and sister-in-law.

Too late to intervene now.

The other guests barely spared them a glance, too engrossed in the unfolding scandal.

Then—gasps.

The intruder’s voice rang out, shocked. "Wait—this isn’t Rebecca and Gordon! It’s Ruth and Simon—Gordon’s nephew!"

The Blackwoods collectively stiffened.

What. The. Hell.

The crowd murmured in scandalized delight. A forbidden affair? This was too juicy to ignore.

Evelyn itched to peek inside but feared the sight might scar her.

From within, Simon’s furious roar erupted. "Get out! This is a violation of my privacy!"

Oh, please. Evelyn rolled her eyes. You orchestrated this whole mess, and now you’re playing victim?

The Blackwoods lingered nearby, listening as Evelyn pieced together the scheme.

Simon had switched the coffee. Ruth, unaware she’d been drugged, had gone to his room to beg him to call off the paparazzi. Instead, he’d lied—telling her it was too late while secretly redirecting the media to this room.

Then—a sharp slap echoed.

"Have you lost your mind?!" Ruth shrieked.

"You—you kissed me first!" Simon’s voice cracked with faux devastation. "I just wanted to help… I love you!"

The Blackwoods exchanged glances.

He’s actually crying?

And—judging by Ruth’s stunned silence—she believed him?

Simon, you absolute snake.

Just as the drama peaked, the neighboring door burst open. Gordon, pale as death, shoved through the crowd and stormed inside.

"What the hell is going on here?!"

###Chapter 147: The Hypocrite's Downfall

The tension in the room skyrocketed as Vincent Holloway stormed in, his face twisted in fury.

At this point, Evelyn Sinclair and her group couldn’t resist stepping inside to witness the chaos firsthand.

Inside, Sebastian Hart and Claudia Bennett had barely managed to pull on their shirts, their lower halves still hidden beneath the tangled sheets, unable to move.

Vincent stood trembling by the bed, his face ghostly pale, his finger shaking as he pointed accusingly at them.

"Darling, I swear—" Claudia’s voice cracked, desperation creeping into her tone.

"Claudia…" Sebastian whimpered from beside her, his expression pitiful, as if silently pleading, Save me.

The Blackwood family nearly choked on their laughter.

Nathan Blackwood smirked, amused by the absurdity of it all. Sebastian, with his muscular build—more suited to a personal trainer than a damsel in distress—was putting on quite the performance.

The paparazzi, initially pretending to be discreet, dropped all pretense and transformed into ruthless journalists.

"Mr. Holloway," one reporter pressed, "how does it feel to walk in on your wife and nephew in such a compromising position?"

Nephew? The Blackwoods exchanged glances, barely containing their amusement.

"Mrs. Holloway," another reporter cut in, "between these two men, who truly holds your heart?"

That was the final straw. The room erupted in stifled laughter.

But the reporters remained stone-faced, relentless in their pursuit of scandal.

"Were the divorce rumors true? Was it never about Miss Vanessa Sterling, but rather your wife’s affair with your own nephew?"

"Mr. Holloway, did you cancel your concert tour because of this betrayal? Did you come here tonight to catch them in the act?"

"Mrs. Holloway, what were you thinking? Cheating on one hand, while conspiring with your socialite friends to ruin Vanessa’s reputation?"

The barrage of questions left Claudia and Vincent both humiliated and furious.

Claudia had hoped Vincent would shut the door and clear the room before she could explain, but—

"Mr. Holloway, don’t play the victim," a voice sneered from the crowd. "You’ve made it clear you don’t love your wife. So you can chase after other women, but if she dares to look elsewhere, she’s the villain?"

The Blackwoods nodded in agreement, finding Vincent’s wounded act laughable.

To him, Claudia was property—something he could discard but never let anyone else have.

Vincent’s mind reeled. He had planned to reconcile with Claudia after this mess was resolved. How dare she betray him with his own nephew?

"You shameless witch!" Vincent exploded, his pride shattered. "At your age, acting like some desperate fool! If you were that lonely, you could’ve bought a damn toy! But no—you had to seduce someone younger! Disgusting!"

His outburst cemented Claudia’s guilt in the eyes of everyone present.

But Claudia’s face paled, her eyes widening in horror.

She had expected the man she loved to defend her. Instead, he spat venom at her. In that moment, the man before her became a stranger—ugly, cruel, nothing like the Vincent she once knew.

Has he lost his mind? The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Vincent’s reputation was already in ruins. If he wanted to salvage anything, he needed Claudia’s support. Yet here he was, insulting the very woman who could save him.

Nathan shook his head. Vincent had been coddled for too long, blinded by his own arrogance.

In their marriage, Claudia held the power—not Vincent. Everything he had was because of her.

Evelyn watched the scene unfold with dark amusement. Oh, Vincent. You could’ve swallowed your pride and lived comfortably off her wealth. But no—you had to play the wounded hero. Now look at you.

But if Claudia remained a hopeless romantic…

"Vincent, shut up!" Claudia snapped, tears brimming in her eyes.

The Blackwoods leaned in, eager for the next act of this drama.

Sebastian, meanwhile, was putting on an Oscar-worthy performance.

Who said he was just some nobody? Evelyn thought. If Isabelle Laurent saw this, she’d sign him in a heartbeat. The man’s a master at playing the wounded lover—a true hypocrite in shining armor.

Thankfully, the room was loud enough that their laughter didn’t ruin his act.

"It was you!" Claudia suddenly accused, pointing at Vincent. "You planned this! You set me up!"

In her panic, she tugged at the sheets, instinctively trying to cover herself—but to Vincent, it looked like she was protecting Sebastian.

Furious, he slapped her. "You fool! You’re still defending him? He played you! Do you really think a young man like him would want an old hag like you? He’s after your money, your status! His whole family are leeches—they used to live off me, and now they want to replace me!"

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Vincent’s digging his own grave.

Claudia’s expression darkened, her tears drying as cold fury took over.

"Uncle Vincent," Sebastian said softly, "just because you didn’t value Claudia doesn’t mean others wouldn’t. She’s been kind to me for years. No one has ever treated me so well. Is it so wrong that I fell for her? She’s brilliant, beautiful—just because you couldn’t see it, doesn’t mean the rest of us are blind."

His words were so convincing that even the reporters hesitated.

The contrast between Vincent’s cruelty and Sebastian’s devotion was staggering.

"You—you little bastard!" Vincent roared. "You slept with your uncle’s wife! Do you think you’ll have a future after this?" He turned to Claudia. "Get up! We’re calling the police!"

"Claudia!" Sebastian cried, feigning panic.

Then Claudia spoke, her voice icy.

"You already handed me divorce papers. So tell me, Vincent—how is this cheating?"

###Chapter 148: Lasted Less Than Two Minutes

Nathan's eyes sparkled with triumph as he leaned closer to Evelyn. "You've been separated for over a year now," he murmured, voice dripping with satisfaction. "There's no moral dilemma between Ruth and me. The only thing missing is a few legal formalities."

Gordon—no, Harrison—stood frozen, as if struck by lightning. His face drained of color, his body swaying slightly under the weight of Ruth's icy rejection. The woman he had manipulated for years was slipping through his fingers, and the realization hit him like a freight train.

"Good heavens! Mrs. Montgomery has made her choice!" someone in the crowd gasped.

The Blackwood family exchanged stunned glances. Given Ruth's earlier hesitation, they had assumed she would remain hopelessly devoted to Harrison.

The paparazzi swarmed, firing questions about the impending divorce. Harrison, still dazed, finally grasped the gravity of his situation. His expression shifted through several shades of disbelief before he forcibly smoothed it into his usual composed facade.

Swallowing his pride, he forced a tender tone. "Darling, this talk of divorce is just a rash decision. Are you really going to throw away our years together over this scheming wretch?" His voice softened, laced with practiced charm. "I can forgive you this once. After all, we've endured so much together. I still want to walk this path with you. Now, the choice is yours—do you trust me, or this conniving snake?"

Harrison knew exactly how to manipulate Ruth. And for a moment, it worked. Her eyes flickered with doubt, memories of their past flooding back—the love, the sacrifices, the years she had spent believing in him.

How predictable.

Nathan scoffed, stepping forward. "Uncle Harrison, spare us the theatrics. Even now, you're still trying to play with Ruth's emotions?"

Harrison's face twisted. "How dare you—"

Before he could finish, a murmur rippled through the crowd.

The paparazzi scrambled to check their recordings, terrified they'd missed the bombshell. The onlookers exchanged scandalized glances, their gazes darting between Harrison and Ruth.

Because the truth was out.

The man who had played the doting husband for years… lasted less than two minutes in bed.

Ruth's hands trembled. "H-How… is this possible?"

Nathan leaned in, whispering something in her ear. Her face flushed crimson, then paled to ghostly white. When she finally looked at Harrison again, her eyes burned with a fury no one had ever seen before.

The Blackwoods, however, already knew the truth.

Nathan had laid it all bare—how Ruth had spent years believing their infertility was her fault, how Harrison had dodged medical tests, how he had manipulated her into carrying the guilt.

And now?

Harrison had the audacity to act betrayed.

"You've lost your mind!" he spat, backing away. "If you're going to humiliate me like this, then fine—let's divorce! But don't expect forgiveness!"

Pathetic.

Evelyn barely suppressed a laugh. Harrison was unraveling before their eyes, his carefully constructed image crumbling into dust.

The hotel staff finally arrived, ushering the crowd away, but the damage was done.

By the time Evelyn and the Blackwoods reached the lobby, whispers had already spread like wildfire. Phones buzzed incessantly, social media exploding with fresh gossip.

She checked hers.

Trending:
➤ Harrison Montgomery lasts less than 2 minutes
➤ The truth behind the Montgomery infertility scandal
➤ Nephew exposes uncle’s decades-long manipulation
➤ Rebecca Whitaker: The unluckiest woman alive

Evelyn smirked.

Game over, Harrison.

###Chapter 149: They Possess Remarkable Stamina

The scandalous affair at the luxury hotel dominated Twitter for two full days. The salacious details were so vivid that the story remained fresh no matter how many times it was revisited.

The men who had been publicly dragged and humiliated were pitiable, but compared to Gordon’s current predicament, they had gotten off lightly.

After all, they had only lost their reputations. Gordon, on the other hand, had been exposed as a man plagued by illness, cheated on, and even poached from—his downfall was nothing short of tragic.

In the grand living room of the Blackwood estate, the family had gathered, as had become their new tradition. Post-dinner gossip sessions had become a daily ritual, leaving them all feeling oddly rejuvenated.

Even Nathan, who rarely left work early, had joined them tonight.

When Evelyn sarcastically remarked on Gordon’s misfortune, Nathan smirked, and the others burst into laughter.

Ever since Evelyn’s transformation, the Blackwood family had grown closer, sharing laughter and stories like never before.

"I just read the latest update," Genevieve announced excitedly. "Mrs. Gonzales has officially filed for divorce. She’s sending Gordon a lawyer’s letter—she’s suing him. He’s already been kicked out of the house."

"The truth is finally out," Margaret mused. "She must be absolutely livid, beyond caring about her reputation now."

Richard added, "Not only is Gordon leaving the marriage with nothing, but he’ll likely have to pay compensation too. He’s lost everything—his career, his family."

Julian shook his head in disbelief. "The paparazzi spotted Simon staying at Mrs. Gonzales’s villa. I can’t believe he actually managed to weasel his way in. Has she completely lost her mind?"

The room erupted in laughter.

Sophia sighed. "After being betrayed so badly, how can she still trust men?"

"Maybe she doesn’t trust them," Evelyn said thoughtfully. "Maybe she just wants to enjoy herself. She’s wealthy, after all. The only unresolved issue is their sabotage of Rebecca."

The mood sobered slightly. Initially, they had hoped the coffee stains on the clothing might reveal traces of drugs, but it turned out the coffee hadn’t been tampered with. The irony was that the person who had intended to drug someone else had ended up the victim. There was nothing more to say.

Then Nathan spoke up. "Mrs. Gonzales’s cousin has been complaining at the office. The scandals she stirred online have affected her family’s businesses, including her own. They’re planning to disown her. She’s not working either, so in the future… I doubt she’ll have much money left to waste."

Ruth’s cousin was a board member at Blackwood Group, so his words carried weight.

The Blackwoods stared at Nathan in surprise. No one had expected the usually serious CEO to pay attention to office gossip—let alone bring it home to share.

This was unlike him.

But when they saw Evelyn’s eyes light up with excitement and her hand instinctively reaching for Nathan’s arm, they exchanged knowing glances.

Is this his new way of charming his wife?

In the past, Richard and Margaret had worried about the couple’s relationship, but lately, Nathan and Evelyn had been inseparable.

"Really?" Evelyn asked eagerly.

Nathan nodded, elaborating in detail.

Evelyn burst into laughter. "Karma always finds a way."

One could only imagine what Ruth’s future would look like without money. What would Simon do then? His reputation was already in ruins—no one would hire a man infamous for seducing his own aunt.

"Finally, Ms. Yancey’s patience has paid off," Genevieve said happily. "No one will dare harm her again."

The family shared a laugh.

Then Sophia suddenly remembered something. "By the way, Evelyn, Julian—what’s happening with your show now?"

Evelyn had never been one to fuss over work. If she could procrastinate, she would. She turned to Julian for the answer.

Julian explained, "Rebecca is still under contract with our agency, so she’ll continue as a supporting act for the stage play."

Evelyn raised her hand. "I could step down and let Rebecca perform with you. Wouldn’t that be perfect? Since Isabelle wants to nurture her talent."

Julian shot her a look. "Do you want to see Preston and Donovan have a breakdown in the middle of the night?"

The entire family burst out laughing.

Nathan turned to Evelyn. "If you really don’t want to participate, I’ll handle the penalty."

Evelyn blinked. "Only one episode left?" She had signed on for an entire season.

"Yes," Julian confirmed. "Only two teams remain, so there’s not much else to innovate. We tried inviting others, but no one dared to join. So Preston and Donovan decided to wrap it up early, freeing up the schedule for other projects."

Evelyn grinned.

One of life’s greatest joys was earning the same money for less work.

"So your group is the only one still fighting," Richard chuckled. "Looks like Evelyn will be judging every performance."

Margaret added, "I’m familiar with the last group. I adored Claire’s shows when I was younger. She was a beloved actress—everyone has seen her dramas. She’s paired with her son’s ex-girlfriend, Vivienne, right? I wonder how they’re getting along."

"People online were so sure Team In-Laws would drop out that they started betting on it," Genevieve said.

Sophia smirked. "If they back out now, it’ll only prove they’re afraid of facing Evelyn and Julian. The internet would tear them apart."

Julian nodded. "Mr. Sharpe approached them, but they didn’t express any desire to quit. Marcus and Isabelle also said there were no major issues. Besides, with Mrs. Harrison’s official backing, she’s probably worked hard to shed her ‘evil mother-in-law’ image."

Margaret sighed. "I remember reading about her. She became a widow so young. She and her son have relied on each other ever since."

"So is she overprotective of him? Does she interfere with his relationships?" Sophia asked.

"That’s the industry rumor," Julian said, hesitating slightly. "Well… you could say that."

The family exchanged glances. His hesitation spoke volumes.


###Chapter 150 - Margaret Is Not One To Be Trifled With

The reason for Claire's interference stemmed from the problematic relationships her godson Gabriel had been involved in. She would use her connections to dig up dirt on his girlfriends, exposing their true colors. Fearful that Gabriel would be led astray, she'd pressure him into ending things. Having grown up under his godmother's strict control, Gabriel never dared to defy her.

The Blackwood family was stunned. While it was understandable to care for one's child, labeling Claire as the "wicked godmother" seemed extreme. After all, she wasn't acting out of personal dislike—she genuinely believed these women were trouble.

"Though honestly, Gabriel didn’t need anyone’s help to go off the rails," Margaret remarked dryly. "Bad apples rot on their own. Thank goodness Vivienne saw through him quickly. Otherwise, I might’ve had to step in myself."

The others gasped. "A bad guy? That mama's boy?"

This revelation hit Genevieve particularly hard—she had once been a huge fan of Gabriel and Vivienne’s relationship.

Gabriel Ramirez was a rapper whose music was mediocre at best, but he’d gained fame through his godmother’s influence and his high-profile ex-girlfriend. Blessed with striking looks inherited from Claire, he had amassed a legion of devoted fans who worshipped him blindly.

During his relationship with Vivienne, paparazzi constantly caught them in intimate moments. At one point, their public displays of affection had the internet swooning. One iconic moment stood out: after a performance, Gabriel rushed offstage, swept Vivienne into his arms, and spun her around. She had surprised him by showing up last-minute, and his excitement was palpable. Without a care for the audience, he hugged her tightly, whispering sweet nothings.

Back then, netizens playfully called Gabriel the "luckiest man alive"—spoiled by his godmother at home and adored by his girlfriend in public.

Judging by Vivienne’s expression in those photos, she had been deeply in love.

Strangely, no scandals about Gabriel ever surfaced online. Even Julian, who moved in the same circles, knew little beyond rumors that Gabriel dabbled in music for fun rather than profit. His lifestyle was bankrolled by his family—and occasionally, his girlfriends. While that was embarrassing, it didn’t necessarily make him a bad person.

After their breakup, Vivienne never spoke ill of him, simply citing "irreconcilable differences." The truth remained a mystery.

Now, the Blackwoods were burning with curiosity—what exactly had Gabriel done?

Evelyn, however, lost interest the moment she heard Vivienne had dumped him.

Just then, Margaret’s phone rang. The moment she saw the caller ID, her expression shifted subtly.

She answered with a casual greeting, then frowned. "What? You’re coming now?"

The family exchanged glances. Who would visit this late? It was downright rude.

But then Margaret glanced at Julian and Evelyn, surprise flickering in her eyes. "You want to discuss the next episode with them?"

Covering the phone, she gave them a questioning look—if they weren’t comfortable, she’d decline.

Before they could respond, Richard suddenly said, "Your childhood friend? Let her come!"

The atmosphere in the Blackwood mansion shifted instantly, as if preparing for battle. The moment the call ended, everyone except Evelyn sprang into action.

Sophia and Genevieve whisked their mother to the vanity room. There was no time for professional stylists, but Genevieve’s artistic eye would suffice. Richard and Julian began rifling through the family’s jewelry vault.

Nathan, ever the strategist, directed the staff to prepare for their "guest."

Only then did Evelyn vaguely recall the backstory.

Margaret had a childhood "friend"—more like a lifelong rival. Jealous of Margaret’s beauty and accomplishments, this woman seized every opportunity to belittle her. Margaret, disliking conflict, usually swallowed her frustration for the sake of family ties.

The Blackwoods had always been low-key, their wealth understated. This so-called friend often mocked their "modest" accessories, unaware of their true value.

Over the years, the family had bitten their tongues during their few encounters.

As the Blackwoods’ fortune grew, the woman had conveniently vanished—until tonight.

Now, they were more than ready to support Margaret.

Evelyn wanted to help too, but there was no opening. So she simply sat beside Margaret, silently offering solidarity.

Watching her family rally for her, Margaret’s heart swelled. She wouldn’t lose this time.

After much insistence, she wore only one piece—a Rockefeller emerald necklace worth a staggering hundred million. Seated in the parlor, she radiated quiet elegance.

When the woman arrived, she immediately zeroed in on the necklace, lips curling in smug satisfaction. "It’s been a while," she purred.

Margaret rose gracefully, her smile serene despite her family’s barely contained glee. "Oh yes, our first meeting since your divorce. That emerald is lovely—part of the settlement?"

The woman’s face darkened.

The Blackwoods gaped.

Evelyn nearly choked. Who said Margaret couldn’t hold her own?

Forced to sit, the woman finally revealed her purpose—touching her necklace with pride, she said, "I’m here for my godson, Gabriel. I want Vivienne eliminated in the next round."

The room froze.

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Gabriel is her godson?!

Seriously, what kind of cursed luck did this man have? First his overbearing godmother, now this woman. Was he doomed to be puppeteered by women forever?

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Could the universe be this cruel?


###Chapter 151: Choosing Her Godson Over Her Own Daughter

Claudia Bennett  her speech with a dramatic pause, her fingers nervously twisting the pearls around her neck as she awaited a reaction from the Blackwood family. The silence that followed was deafening. Her confident smile faltered as she scanned the room, only to be met with carefully controlled expressions of disapproval.

Her gaze landed on Margaret Blackwood, her disappointment sharp. "What is this? You won’t even help me with such a simple request?" Claudia’s voice dripped with disbelief, as if Margaret had personally betrayed her.

Margaret blinked, caught off guard. "Have you been living under a rock? The last person who tried to blacklist someone in the industry ended up disowned by their own family," she shot back, her tone laced with incredulity.

Richard Blackwood, amused, added, "Not to mention, they once tried to pursue our daughter-in-law. The outcome was…" He trailed off, prompting quiet chuckles from the others as they glanced at Evelyn Sinclair, who feigned innocence with practiced ease.

Claudia scoffed. "How is that relevant? After all these years of friendship, shouldn’t the younger generation show some respect to their elders?"

The Blackwoods exchanged glances, unimpressed by her entitlement.

Evelyn couldn’t resist. "Respect? Have you ever given any of us so much as a birthday gift? Why should we owe you anything?"

The room froze at her bluntness, but the logic was undeniable.

Julian Blackwood smirked. "You demand respect without ever offering kindness. That’s not how this works."

Claudia’s irritation flared. "Margaret, do you really want me to tell your parents how little you value our friendship?" she threatened, her voice sharp.

The younger Blackwoods stiffened—none of them were used to elders resorting to parental tattling.

Margaret, however, remained composed. "Our family doesn’t abuse power to settle personal grudges. Besides, this affects Evelyn’s reputation in the industry. She’s built her career on fairness—no favoritism, no exceptions."

Evelyn cringed internally. Margaret’s been reading too many online think pieces. This is so awkward.

Still, Margaret stood firm, pride evident in her stance. The rest of the family barely suppressed their amusement.

Claudia recoiled. "You—!" She hadn’t expected resistance over what she considered a trivial favor. Recovering, she snapped, "I’m not here to intimidate anyone. I’m simply warning you—Vivienne Monroe has a questionable character. Your so-called ‘fair judge’ better scrutinize her thoroughly next round. We can’t let her manipulate my godson!"

The Blackwoods exchanged knowing looks. Claudia’s obsession with her godson, Gabriel Ramirez, was infamous.

Rumors swirled that her divorce had been fueled by her unnatural attachment to him. She had a daughter with her ex-husband, yet over time, it became painfully clear that Gabriel received all her affection while her own flesh and blood was neglected.

When her daughter developed severe psychological issues—directly linked to Claudia’s indifference—her ex-husband’s family demanded a divorce. They believed even a detached stepmother would treat the girl better.

Custody went to the father, and Claudia made no effort to reconnect. When questioned, she claimed her daughter was a "nemesis from a past life," destined to ruin her. Among the elite, eccentric beliefs weren’t uncommon—but this was extreme.

Now, here she was, begging Margaret—a woman she barely tolerated—for help, all for Gabriel’s sake.

The Blackwoods were morbidly fascinated. How had Gabriel become her godson?

Evelyn leaned in, intrigued.

Claudia, meanwhile, was still ranting, proposing aggressive tactics against Vivienne as if she were Gabriel’s real mother—a classic meddling mother-in-law sabotaging her son’s love life.

Ah, Evelyn realized. Claudia was in love with Gabriel’s father, Victor Grant.

The Blackwoods knew the gossip. Victor had been involved with Mrs. Harrison for years, and their military ties meant Claudia couldn’t pursue him openly. After his death, she’d inserted herself into Gabriel’s life, becoming his overbearing godmother.

Now, she was here, demanding they ruin Vivienne—all for the son of the man she’d never been able to have.


The revelation left the Blackwoods utterly speechless.

Yet Evelyn pressed on without hesitation.

Claudia's sudden visit reeked of petty vindictiveness—no wonder it had felt so abrupt and unwarranted.

The mention of a wager immediately captured their attention even more.

"I'm not one to indulge in gossip," Evelyn continued smoothly, "but it appears Mrs. Harrison, after spending time with Vivienne, found her quite agreeable. Yet here Claudia is, raising objections. Gabriel wants to reconcile, but Claudia is so vehemently opposed that she came to us, hoping we'd intervene. But let's be honest—Vivienne has no intention of returning to that toxic situation."

The Blackwoods exchanged surprised glances. They had expected Claire to be the stereotypical harsh mother-in-law, yet she had actually approved of Vivienne after meeting her—a stark contrast to the cold, judgmental persona often depicted in tabloids. Unfortunately, Claire remained oblivious to her son's true nature, while Vivienne had seen it all too clearly, rendering Claudia's satisfaction utterly meaningless.

Claudia, behaving more like an overbearing parent than a mere godmother, seemed determined to micromanage not just Gabriel's life but also his romantic entanglements.

But what exactly had Gabriel done? Neither Claudia nor Claire seemed aware of his transgressions. So what had Vivienne uncovered that had driven her to end things so decisively?

As Claudia finally concluded her lengthy tirade, she noticed the distracted expressions around her and snapped. "Were any of you even listening to me?" she demanded, her voice sharp with irritation.

The Blackwoods offered polite reassurances, though it was painfully obvious that if not for the impending engagement between Evelyn and Nathan, they would have had zero interest in entertaining such petty drama.

Claudia's frustration simmered beneath the surface as she reflected on the lengths she had gone to for Gabriel. If not for him, she would never have subjected herself to this humiliating ordeal.

In the past, Claire had been her ally in warding off unsuitable partners for Gabriel. Why hadn't she noticed sooner that something was off about Vivienne? Had it not been for her promise to Gabriel to keep the matter under wraps, she would have taken legal action against Vivienne from the very beginning.

###Chapter 152: The Ones Closest To Us

Claudia Bennett's frustration was palpable as she paced the room, her fingers nervously twisting the strand of pearls around her neck. Margaret Blackwood, never one to mince words, cut straight to the chase. "You claim there's something wrong with Vivienne Monroe's character. What exactly is the issue?"

Claudia hesitated, then muttered under her breath, "Isn't she rumored to have tax evasion problems?"

Margaret blinked, her expression shifting to disbelief. "Do you live under a rock? If a celebrity was actually evading taxes, they'd be blacklisted from the industry. The fact that she’s still thriving proves she’s clean."

"How is that possible?" Claudia protested, her brows knitting together. "I distinctly remember Gabriel mentioning she had to go back and settle her taxes!"

Julian Blackwood stepped in, his tone firm. "That issue was tied to her family’s agency—something she wasn’t even aware of. The moment she found out, she took immediate action to fix it."

He went on to explain how Vivienne had become somewhat of a role model in the industry, voluntarily auditing her finances when others were still scrambling to cover their tracks.

"It’s honestly tragic," Julian continued. "Her family exploited her relentlessly. Her mother and uncle controlled her agency, forcing her into back-to-back projects while pocketing the profits. If not for them holding her back, she could’ve reached even greater heights. And then, just when she thought she’d found happiness with Gabriel, they nearly dragged her into another mess."

The Blackwood family listened, their expressions darkening with each revelation.

Meanwhile, Claudia, having lost her initial argument, could only grumble, "Well, regardless, she’s still problematic."

Margaret rolled her eyes. "You just don’t like her, do you?"

Some mothers-in-law resented their sons’ partners out of possessiveness, but in this case, it was Claudia who seemed irrational.

Claudia’s grip tightened around her pearls, her face flushing with indignation. "Fine, since you’re all so determined to defend her, I’ll tell you the truth—but you must swear to secrecy. I promised Gabriel I wouldn’t reveal this. He’s too kind, even after their breakup, he didn’t want to humiliate her. But if he’s still hung up on her, I have no choice." She took a deep breath. "Just… when you deal with her, don’t let her know it came from me."

The Blackwoods exchanged glances, sensing Claudia’s desperation to protect her godson.

"Because," Claudia hissed, her voice trembling with anger, "when Gabriel brought her to visit me once, she tried to steal this necklace!" She clutched the pearls dramatically. "Can you believe the audacity? What kind of woman does that?"

Margaret’s jaw dropped, mirroring the shock rippling through the room.

The accusation hung in the air, heavy and damning.

Everyone knew Vivienne Monroe as a down-to-earth, diligent woman with an impeccable reputation—law-abiding, principled, and morally unshakable.

Claudia Bennett, still fuming, recounted the incident with sharp precision. "I had intended to flaunt my emerald necklace to that woman, so I invited her into my private jewelry room. But during dinner, my housekeeper informed me the necklace had vanished. I turned the entire household upside down searching for it—nothing. Just as I was about to call the police, the necklace miraculously reappeared in the bathroom. And let me be clear—I had checked that spot myself earlier. How could it just materialize out of thin air? It had to be her, panicked and slipping it back. When I retrieved it, the damn thing was still warm from her skin!"

"Back then, I wanted to press charges, but Gabriel stopped me. After their breakup, I washed my hands of it. But now my foolish godson wants to reconcile with that thief? I shudder to think what she’d do to my collection next. That woman will never set foot near Gabriel again!" Claudia concluded, righteous fury lacing every word.

The Blackwoods exchanged uneasy glances, some considering the possibility that the young woman might have acted impulsively—though the idea seemed ludicrous.

Evelyn Sinclair’s mind raced. That can’t be true. I need to verify this myself.

As Evelyn processed the accusation, the rest of the family dove into debate.

"Did she ever confess?" Genevieve Blackwood pressed, brows knitted.

Claudia scoffed. "Without catching her red-handed? She’d never admit a thing."

"So there’s no concrete evidence?" Sophia Blackwood interjected. "Could it have been someone else?"

Claudia bristled. "Are you implying my staff? They’ve served me faithfully for decades. The very thought is insulting!"

Julian Blackwood, ever the skeptic, mused aloud, "Is it possible you accidentally took it to the bathroom yourself?"

Claudia’s face flushed with indignation. "Do I strike you as senile?"

At this, Nathan Blackwood—usually reserved—leaned forward, his analytical mind dissecting the scenario. "Stealing such a distinctive piece makes no sense. It’s too recognizable, especially for someone in the public eye. The only logical motive would be financial desperation, but given her wealth, that’s improbable. Alternatively, a compulsive collector might take it, but the risk far outweighs the reward."

The moment Nathan , he felt Evelyn’s gaze lock onto him. When their eyes met, hers sparkled with admiration, sending an unexpected warmth through his chest.

Wow. Nathan’s brilliant.

Nathan, caught off guard by her silent praise, felt his ears heat.

The rest of the Blackwoods, sensing the charged moment, exchanged knowing glances but said nothing.

Evelyn, however, was lost in thought, Nathan’s words echoing in her mind.

He’s right. It was stolen to be sold.

The realization settled like ice in her veins.

The room fell into stunned silence as the Bennett family struggled to process the shocking revelation.

However, the thief wasn’t Vivienne Monroe, nor any of the household staff—it was Gabriel Ramirez, the last person Claudia Bennett would have ever suspected.

The Blackwoods, though shocked, found this explanation oddly fitting.

Now it made sense why Gabriel had been so adamant about Claudia dropping the issue—he wasn’t just defending his girlfriend out of loyalty, but out of fear that his own misdeeds would be exposed.

Still, there were puzzling gaps in the story. Claudia had always doted on him, yet he had resorted to theft. If he truly needed money, why hadn’t he simply asked her?

As the Blackwoods mulled over the situation, Evelyn finally pieced everything together.

Because Mrs. Harrison was such a strict disciplinarian, Gabriel had very limited access to funds. Worse, she meticulously tracked every penny Claudia gave him, further restricting his spending. That was why he had turned to stealing. Initially, he hadn’t even considered taking the most valuable item—the pearl necklace.

But who could blame him? His gambling debts had spiraled out of control. He didn’t just want to clear them—he wanted to win back his losses and make a grand return to the gambling tables. That was why he had targeted the most valuable asset—the pearl necklace.

The Blackwood family collectively exhaled in disbelief.

Gabriel wasn’t just a gambler—he was a master at hiding his addiction.

He had brought Vivienne along as a decoy, knowing Claudia’s habit of flaunting her jewelry. He was confident she would showcase her collection, giving him the perfect opportunity to steal. If caught, he could argue on Vivienne’s behalf, banking on Claudia’s affection to avoid serious consequences—or at least buy himself time to recover his losses. What he hadn’t anticipated was being caught so soon, ruining his entire plan.

As the Blackwoods processed this revelation, their understanding deepened.

Oh, now it makes sense. His plan had failed, forcing him to grit his teeth and borrow money from Vivienne under the pretense of funding a concert.

Whispers spread among the family. Could this be connected to an unpaid debt?

Before long, Vivienne realized there had never been any concert. After some discreet digging, she uncovered the truth—Gabriel was a chronic gambler drowning in debt. She knew her money was gone for good, especially without a formal IOU. Recognizing the futility of expecting a gambler to change, she wisely cut her losses and walked away.

The Blackwoods couldn’t help but admire Vivienne’s decisiveness—she knew when to walk away.

But ten million! She let him off too easily! What a naive girl! Every time I think about it, it makes my blood boil! And he still had the nerve to try to win her back—probably just to use her again! Pay her back first, you little brat!

At this point, Claudia still harbored suspicions toward Vivienne. The mere thought was infuriating. Perhaps…

After all this, we still haven’t addressed Gabriel. Does he even have an alibi? Mrs. Harrison, it’s always the ones closest to us we need to watch out for, isn’t it?
###Chapter 153 Is It Really That Unfathomable

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced the marble floors, her silk robe fluttering behind her. Her phone buzzed incessantly with notifications from the Blackwood Industries board members, each message more urgent than the last.

"Miss Sinclair?" Lillian Graves, her assistant, hovered by the doorway. "Nathan Blackwood's team just confirmed the merger meeting for 10 AM. They're requesting your final proposal."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee cup. "Tell Mr. Blackwood I'll be there with bells on." Her voice dripped with sarcasm. The Blackwood heir had been playing corporate games for weeks, dangling the merger like a carrot while his lawyers picked apart her company's contracts.

Across town, Nathan adjusted his cufflinks in the floor-to-ceiling windows of his corner office. His reflection showed a man perfectly composed, but the tension in his jaw betrayed him. "Status on the Sinclair acquisition?" he asked without turning.

Marcus Donovan stepped forward. "All due diligence completed, sir. But our legal team found discrepancies in their intellectual property filings. Significant ones."

Nathan's lips curved. "How convenient." He'd known Evelyn Sinclair was hiding something since their first disastrous meeting at the charity gala. The way her emerald eyes flashed when challenged, the defiant tilt of her chin - she was a wildfire in Prada heels.

At 9:55 AM, Evelyn strode into Blackwood Tower's lobby, her stilettos clicking like a countdown. The elevator ride to the 50th floor gave her exactly thirty seconds to compose herself. She inhaled sharply as the doors slid open to reveal Nathan leaning against the conference table, his tailored suit emphasizing shoulders broad enough to carry the weight of his family empire.

"Ms. Sinclair." His voice was smooth whiskey. "I was beginning to think you'd gotten cold feet."

Evelyn dropped her portfolio with a thud. "Unlike some, Mr. Blackwood, I don't retreat from challenges." She flipped open the file to reveal not the expected contracts, but a series of damning photographs. "Though you might want to after seeing these."

Nathan's smirk faltered as he recognized the images - his sister Sophia's secret meetings with Evelyn's chief investor. "Where did you get these?"

"A woman never reveals her sources." Evelyn leaned in, close enough to catch his expensive cologne. "But I'll trade them for fair merger terms. Unless you'd prefer the tabloids to see how Blackwood Industries really does business?"

The room temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. Nathan's knuckles whitened against the table's edge. Just as he opened his mouth to respond, his phone vibrated with an alert: Incoming call from Margaret Blackwood.

Evelyn arched a perfectly groomed brow. "Shall we let Mommy weigh in?"

Nathan's eyes darkened to stormy gray. In one fluid motion, he swiped the photos into his briefcase and gripped Evelyn's wrist. "You and I," he said through gritted teeth, "are going to discuss this privately."

As he pulled her toward his private elevator, Evelyn's pulse raced - not from fear, but exhilaration. The game had just gotten interesting.

The unexpected accusation from Evelyn visibly incensed Claudia Bennett, her expression darkening instantly. It was no secret that Gabriel Ramirez was her pride and joy, treated like the most precious gem in her life.

"What nonsense are you spouting? How could my godson possibly be the thief?" Claudia snapped, her voice dripping with disbelief.

Evelyn pursed her lips. It was your godson who did it!

The Blackwoods found the exchange mildly amusing, but Claudia, mistaking their amusement for mockery, bristled with indignation. "Are you all accusing my godson now?" she retorted sharply. "Is there anything I wouldn’t give him that he’d need to steal?"

He’s spoiled rotten by you, but he wouldn’t dare ask you outright. The moment he did, it would expose his gambling habit—a secret he’s desperate to keep hidden.

"Claudia, don’t get so worked up," Margaret interjected smoothly, attempting to diffuse the tension. "Even detectives consider everyone a suspect at first. It’s only natural to question Gabriel since Evelyn doesn’t know him. Do you have any proof he’s never been inside your jewelry room?"

Claudia faltered at Margaret’s words. She had taken Vivienne Monroe and Gabriel there, but her focus had been entirely on Vivienne, eager to flaunt her influence as Gabriel’s godmother.

As for Gabriel… she honestly couldn’t remember what he’d been doing at the time.

For a brief moment, Claudia seemed lost in thought, but then she straightened, as if struck by sudden clarity. "Fine, if you won’t take my word for it, let’s look at the facts. Vivienne was the only one carrying a bag, and her outfit could’ve easily concealed something. But Gabriel was wearing a simple basketball jersey. How could he have possibly hidden a necklace under everyone’s noses?"

The Blackwoods paused, considering the logic. A strand of pearls that long would surely leave a noticeable bulge, wouldn’t it?

After the necklace vanished, they’d all searched frantically. No one was blind—if Gabriel had taken it, someone would’ve noticed.

Curiosity flickered among the Blackwoods. With no other leads, they had no choice but to rely on Evelyn to solve the mystery.

Fortunately, Evelyn was just as intrigued.

She’s quick with words, I’ll give her that. But let’s see—how exactly did he pull it off? Wait…

Evelyn’s thoughts suddenly sharpened, startling everyone present.

Oh my God. No way.

The Blackwoods exchanged puzzled glances. What’s happening? Why is she so shocked?

All eyes turned to Evelyn, who was now staring intently at Claudia’s necklace, her pupils trembling slightly. Then her gaze dropped to Claudia’s hand—the one that habitually toyed with her pearls—and—

The exchange of glances had nearly driven the Blackwoods to the edge of madness with curiosity.

All that echoed in Evelyn’s mind was the voice of someone who had narrowly escaped catastrophe. We were so lucky. Thank heavens Claudia was too arrogant to bother with the usual pleasantries of a handshake when she walked in. Otherwise, we’d need to scrub our hands raw…

The Blackwoods were utterly baffled by her thoughts.

Who would’ve guessed a pearl necklace of such exorbitant value had once been… there?

An uneasy premonition slithered through them at her musings.

There’s no way Gabriel could be gay, right? He’s so… enigmatic.

The Blackwoods jolted in shock, their minds racing. Wait—what? All of them? Each pearl is the size of a coin, and there are—what—twenty, thirty in total? Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

Oh, thank goodness. Evelyn exhaled in relief. I knew it couldn’t be true.

The entire room nearly choked on their collective gasp. How could anyone believe a man would go to such lengths just to steal a necklace? Clearly, Evelyn must have been mistaken.

How could that much possibly fit? The rest must’ve been strapped to his body, like wearing a— Evelyn’s thoughts screeched to a halt. No, no, no! Stop imagining that! I didn’t mean to picture it! I’m innocent! Scatter, scatter!

But it was too late. The Blackwoods’ minds had already conjured the scene, and the more they tried to banish it, the more vivid it became.

Fade away! Disappear!

Then they remembered Claudia’s earlier remark—that the pearl necklace had still been warm when it was found.

That warmth… probably wasn’t just body heat.

As one, their gazes snapped to the pearls gleaming around Claudia’s neck.

Is it just us, or does that pearl have a faint… yellowish tint?

Claudia’s expression darkened as she noticed the sudden shift in their faces—a kaleidoscope of horror, disbelief, and something uncomfortably close to pity.

"What’s wrong with all of you?" she demanded, her voice sharp. "After everything I’ve said, you still doubt Gabriel?"

Like any parent, she refused to entertain the idea that her beloved godson could be anything less than perfect.

The Blackwoods, however, only looked at her with deepening sympathy.

Claudia grew more agitated, especially when she caught their lingering stares at her necklace. Instinctively, her fingers brushed against the pearls—

A collective gasp filled the room.

She touched it. Oh, sweet heavens, she actually touched it!

Their expressions twisted further, particularly Margaret’s, who had known Claudia for years.

The sun cast long shadows across the Blackwood estate as the family gathered in the parlor, the air thick with unspoken tension. Claudia Bennett sat stiffly on the edge of her seat, her fingers nervously tracing the outline of the diamond necklace around her throat—the very same necklace that had once belonged to her ex-husband.

Nathan Blackwood leaned against the fireplace, his sharp gaze flickering between Claudia and his mother, Margaret, who wore an expression of thinly veiled disapproval. Sophia Blackwood, Nathan’s sister, exchanged a knowing glance with her husband, Daniel Prescott, while Julian Blackwood, the youngest of the siblings, sighed audibly, clearly bored with the entire affair.

“It’s been years,” Claudia muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. “Surely, this isn’t still an issue?”

Margaret’s lips thinned. “It’s not about the time that’s passed, Claudia. It’s about the manner in which you acquired it.”

A heavy silence settled over the room. The story of the necklace was no secret—Claudia had given up custody of her daughter in exchange for it. A cold bargain, one that had left scars deeper than any gemstone could ever glitter over.

Sophia shifted uncomfortably. “We can’t exactly judge her for choices made in desperation,” she said softly, though even she couldn’t muster much sympathy.

“Desperation?” Julian scoffed. “She traded her own child for a piece of jewelry.”

Claudia’s face flushed with anger. “You have no idea what I went through!”

Nathan finally spoke, his voice calm but edged with steel. “No, we don’t. But we do know that Javier Ramirez—your godson—has been asking about you. Quite persistently.”

Claudia stiffened. “Javier?”

Margaret’s eyes narrowed. “Yes. The same Javier whose gambling debts you so generously paid off before disappearing. Odd, isn’t it? That he’d be so desperate to find you now?”

A flicker of panic crossed Claudia’s face before she masked it with indignation. “That’s ridiculous! He’s just a boy who misses his godmother.”

Nathan exchanged a glance with Julian. “Or a gambler who’s run out of luck—and funds.”

Claudia shot to her feet. “How dare you accuse me of—”

“Enough,” Margaret cut in sharply. “The point is, Claudia, this necklace isn’t just a trinket. It’s a reminder of choices—yours, Javier’s, even Gabriel’s. And until you face the truth of what it represents, you’ll never be free of it.”

Claudia’s hands trembled as she clutched the necklace, the diamonds biting into her skin. For the first time, the weight of it felt unbearable.

And in that moment, she wondered—was it really worth the price she’d paid?

###Chapter 154: Walking Straight Into the Trap

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she lounged on her velvet chaise, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her champagne flute. Across the room, her assistant Lillian Graves hovered near the doorway, clutching a tablet bursting with notifications.

"Miss Sinclair," Lillian began hesitantly, "the media outlets are going wild with speculation about you and Mr. Blackwood after last night's gala."

Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smirk. She could practically hear the tabloid headlines screaming about the "electric chemistry" between her and Nathan Blackwood when they'd shared that dance. The way his hand had lingered at the small of her back...

"Let them talk," Evelyn purred, taking a sip of champagne. The bubbles tickled her tongue like the thrill of a well-kept secret.

Lillian cleared her throat. "There's more. Miss Hayes has been making calls all morning to—"

"Victoria?" Evelyn's manicured nails tightened around her glass. That viper in Prada had been circling Nathan like a shark scenting blood ever since Evelyn entered the picture.

As if on cue, Evelyn's phone buzzed with an incoming message from Preston Whitmore: "Darling, you'll never guess who just booked a private lunch at Le Ciel..."

Evelyn didn't need to guess. The exclusive restaurant was Nathan's usual power lunch spot, and Victoria Hayes had been photographed there just last week. Coincidence? Hardly.

A slow, dangerous smile spread across Evelyn's face as she set down her glass. "Cancel my afternoon, Lillian. It seems I have a reservation to make."

Her mind already raced with possibilities as she strode toward her walk-in closet. The game was afoot, and Evelyn Sinclair never played to lose. Let Victoria try her little schemes—by the time Evelyn was done, Nathan Blackwood wouldn't remember the other woman's name.

The real question was: would this be a subtle maneuver or a full-frontal assault? Evelyn's fingers hovered between a sleek power suit and a knockout red dress. Decisions, decisions...

Meanwhile, her phone lit up again—this time with Nathan's name flashing across the screen. The plot, as they say, thickened.

Evelyn had never met the person in question, so she couldn't form an opinion from their perspective. At this, the Blackwoods also expressed deep regret.

Claudia, however, remained stubbornly persistent in her persuasion.

"That little witch can't keep bewitching Gabriel's heart—she needs to be ruined! I'm not in the entertainment industry, so I can't dig up dirt on her, but a girl like her must have plenty of skeletons in her closet. Investigate her, expose her on stage, just like the others before her. And make that foolish woman, Claire, open her eyes! Let her see what kind of person she’s defending. Maybe then she’ll finally listen to me!" Claudia spoke with such smug satisfaction that the Blackwood family was left speechless.

"Maybe there’s no dirt because she’s actually clean?" Sophia muttered under her breath. "The fact that she’s still standing on that stage says a lot."

Unable to hold back, Genevieve snapped, "Mrs. Bennett, have you even watched the previous episodes? It’s your precious godson who’s chasing after Vivienne. Shouldn’t you be scolding him instead of blaming the women who are just reacting to his nonsense? This is entirely his fault!"

—Having seen enough, Genevieve couldn’t stand the twisted logic of these people. How could they be so blind when it came to men?

"Sophia and Gen are right."

The two sisters exchanged smug smiles, leaving Claudia flushed with frustration.

"I won’t waste my breath on clueless children like you! Margaret, are you going to help me or not?" Claudia demanded.

Margaret’s expression turned icy. "My children have far better judgment than you."

The insult was too much for Claudia. She shot up from her seat, her pearl necklace swinging violently—instantly drawing everyone’s attention.

Just as she was about to explode, she noticed Margaret staring intently at her necklace. A mocking smirk curled on Claudia’s lips. "Oh, I see now. You’re just bitter because there are things you can never compete with me on. So you refuse to help out of sheer pettiness. How pathetic."

She tilted her chin, deliberately showcasing the pearls from every angle.

Among the elite socialites of the city, few could rival her when it came to jewelry.

Watching Claudia’s shameless preening, the Blackwoods wanted to scream—Please, stop this horror show. They didn’t dare look too closely, afraid of what their imaginations might conjure.

"Mrs. Bennett, is this necklace the only thing you have to flaunt?" Julian asked, genuinely afraid that if he stared any longer, his mind would be permanently scarred.

Claudia stiffened, both embarrassed and furious at being called out. "What kind of manners are these? Is this how your family raised you?"

Before Julian could even respond, Evelyn's voice cut through the tension. "Exactly, Julian. Your manners are lacking."

Instantly, Julian shot her a sharp glare, and the rest of the Blackwood family turned their attention toward her.

Claudia Bennett, however, had already begun to laugh, ready to add fuel to the fire—until Evelyn interrupted her. "We're in public. Do you really think it's appropriate to speak so bluntly? You're practically slapping Mrs. Harrison in the face. Pointing out others' flaws so openly is beyond presumptuous!"

Julian couldn't help but smirk, though he quickly schooled his expression into something more serious. "My apologies for overstepping," he conceded, though the amusement in his eyes was unmistakable.

The other Blackwood family members struggled to hide their smiles.

It took Claudia a moment to realize—she was being played for a fool. Fury ignited in her chest as she turned on Evelyn. "Don't think just because you've schemed your way into the Blackwood family that you're truly its lady. You're nothing but a penniless nobody. How dare you speak to me like that? Just wait—"

There were plenty of people in the room who had criticized her, but Claudia only dared to retaliate against Evelyn. In the eyes of society, Evelyn had no backing of her own—she was seen as an outsider, dependent on the Blackwoods' goodwill, someone who could be discarded at any moment.

Claudia had chosen the easiest target.

What she didn’t notice was the way the Blackwoods' expressions darkened the moment she opened her mouth.

Then, Nathan spoke.

"Mrs. Bennett."

His voice was deep, laced with a chilling edge, the kind of tone that carried unspoken threats.

Claudia froze, startled by the icy authority in his voice. She turned to face the man society hailed as the most exemplary heir of a prestigious family—only to shrink under the weight of his piercing gaze.

"You’ve insulted my wife," Nathan stated calmly. "You will apologize."

Claudia was stunned. I’m the elder here. I’ve known his mother for years. How dare he speak to me like this?

Her breath hitched as she turned to Margaret, expecting her to reprimand her son. Instead, she found not just Margaret, but the entire Blackwood family staring at her with cold disapproval. Their solidarity was unmistakable.

Claudia couldn’t comprehend it. "All I did was correct an insolent junior. Given our families' relationship, don’t I have the right?"

"Evelyn is our treasured daughter-in-law," Richard countered sharply. "Neither my wife nor I would ever dream of scolding her. What gives you the right?"

Margaret scoffed. "What’s so special about the Bennetts? If you want to throw your weight around, go home and do it there. Evelyn is the future matriarch of the Blackwood family!"

Julian's lips curled into a mocking smirk as he addressed Claudia Bennett. "Mrs. Harrison, it seems you've gravely misjudged your position in this family. Evelyn's standing surpasses even that of my siblings."

Sophia and Genevieve nodded in agreement, their expressions tight with barely restrained fury.

Evelyn stood frozen, stunned by the sudden escalation. What had started as a simple argument—one she was fully prepared to counter—had spiraled into something far more intense. Yet amidst the chaos, an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest, comforting and foreign, like sinking into a cloud of sunlit velvet.

Under Claudia's disbelieving stare, Nathan's face remained impassive, his voice icy. "Do you intend to apologize, Mrs. Harrison?"

Claudia's frustration flared, her temper ready to snap—until Nathan spoke again, his tone cutting like winter steel. "It seems the Harrison family no longer has any interest in the land they've been so desperate to acquire."

The words struck like a physical blow.

Her comfortable lifestyle post-divorce had been sustained by the Harrisons' support. She knew exactly how vital that land was to them, and she was painfully aware of the Blackwoods' influence. If they pull out because of me…

Her response was frantic. "What are you saying? The Harrisons and your mother's family have been allies for generations! Would your grandparents approve of you threatening an elder like this?"

Nathan didn't indulge her further. "So, the hotel chain project is no longer a priority?"

The weight of his words crushed her. Her hands trembled.

Nathan gave her no room to argue, his expression unyielding, as if he were seconds from making a devastating call.

Then—

"I apologize! I apologize!" Claudia gasped.

Time was slipping away, and she had no leverage left.

Nathan paused, his gaze piercing.

To see a woman of her status reduced to this—breathless, humiliated, her eyes red with unshed tears as she bowed her head—was a stark realization.

This wasn't like my petty disputes with Margaret, she thought. Those had been battles of pride, never crossing into outright disrespect. Had I ever dared to speak to her the way I did to Evelyn, I would have faced the same consequences.

It hit her then—the Harrisons were nothing compared to the Blackwoods, a family whose power needed no announcement.

I should have seen it coming... I never should have stepped foot in this place.

.

"I—I apologize! That was out of line," she forced out through gritted teeth, the words tasting bitter on her tongue. Swallowing her pride, she managed the apology before spinning on her heel to leave. But just before the door closed behind her, she couldn’t resist throwing one last barb over her shoulder. "Margaret, consider our friendship over!"

Margaret merely arched a brow, her tone dripping with indifference. "As if I ever considered you a friend." With that, she immediately turned her attention to Evelyn, worried Claudia’s sharp words might have stung.

But what she found instead was Evelyn staring at Nathan with stars in her eyes.

Wow. Seeing the ruthless CEO up close like this… His presence is absolutely magnetic. He’s breathtaking.

Nathan, who had initially stiffened at the unexpected compliment, felt an odd warmth spread through his chest. He subtly straightened his posture, about to respond—when he caught the next thought drifting from Evelyn’s mind.

He’s so gorgeous, I can barely stop myself from rushing over and kissing him senseless!

Nathan froze. His gaze locked onto Evelyn’s, his face heating instantly.

She wants to kiss me? Right here? In front of my family? But then again… these were just her thoughts. People acted on impulse all the time. That kiss could happen any second now. And… he wasn’t sure he wanted to stop it.

The rest of the Blackwood family watched with wide eyes, barely containing their amusement. They weren’t about to miss a single second of this unexpected drama.

What do I do? I’m so nervous. Is this really happening?

Then, Evelyn stepped forward, a dazzling smile curving her lips—one that made Nathan’s breath hitch.

"Thank you!" she beamed.

Nathan blinked, confused.

She turned to the others, her expression softening. "Thank you all for standing up for me."

Then, curiosity getting the better of her, she tilted her head. "Since she struck out here, do you think she’ll try something with Vivienne next?"

The room fell into a heavy silence.

A beat passed.

Then another.

Realization dawned.

Evelyn was all talk. No action.

A few days later, Evelyn and the others joined the production team for the announcement of the upcoming performance theme.

The moment Evelyn’s group arrived, Preston and Donovan immediately made their way over.

Bracing herself for a warning to behave, Evelyn was caught off guard when Preston grinned and said, "You’re just in time. Things are about to get interesting—we’re drawing lots after the reveal."

"Oh?" Isabelle perked up.

Donovan chuckled. "Mrs. Harrison’s son just arrived. Rumor has it he’s planning a surprise proposal for Vivienne."

Evelyn and the group stood frozen in disbelief.

The sheer audacity of the situation left them speechless.

"Unbelievable," Victoria muttered under her breath, shaking her head in astonishment.

Serena crossed her arms, her lips curling into a wry smile. "I've seen my fair share of poorly planned proposals, but this? This takes the cake."

Nathan's expression darkened as he watched the scene unfold. His fingers twitched at his sides, the only outward sign of his simmering frustration.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her forehead, torn between secondhand embarrassment and genuine concern. "Who in their right mind would think this was a good idea?"

The answer came in the form of a red-faced man kneeling on one knee, holding out a ring to a visibly horrified woman.

Margaret, standing beside Evelyn, let out a soft sigh. "The last man who tried to propose without considering the woman's feelings ended up with a drink in his face."

Sophia Blackwood, ever the pragmatist, added dryly, "At least he had the decency to do it in private. This is just... spectacularly bad judgment."

Lillian Graves, Evelyn's ever-loyal assistant, leaned in with wide eyes. "Do you think he realizes how obvious this trap is? Or is he just that oblivious?"

As if on cue, the woman in question took a deliberate step back, her expression hardening. "You can't be serious."

The man blinked up at her, confusion written across his features. "But I thought—"

"You didn't think," she cut him off sharply. "That's the problem."

A collective wince went through the onlookers.

Julian Blackwood, watching from the sidelines with Marcus Donovan, shook his head. "I give him points for bravery, but negative points for common sense."

Marcus chuckled darkly. "Some people never learn."

Evelyn couldn't help but agree. The entire situation was like watching a train wreck in slow motion—horrifying yet impossible to look away from.

As the woman turned on her heel and stormed off, leaving the would-be proposer kneeling alone in the middle of the room, Evelyn felt a pang of sympathy.

Not for him, of course.

But for anyone who could walk so blindly into such an obvious trap.

###Chapter 155: The Pursuit of Vivienne

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind already buzzing with anticipation. Today was one of those rare days when she could indulge in her guilty pleasure—eavesdropping on the unfiltered thoughts of those around her.

With a smirk, Evelyn sipped her coffee, letting the bitter warmth wake her fully. Her psychic ability had always been a double-edged sword, but moments like these made it worth the chaos. She tuned into the mental chatter around her, filtering through the mundane until she struck gold.

"Oh my God, did Nathan Blackwood really just text me at 2 AM?" Victoria Hayes’s shrill inner voice pierced Evelyn’s mind like a needle. The secretary’s giddy excitement was almost nauseating. "He said he couldn’t sleep without thinking about me. Take that, Evelyn!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Oh, please. Nathan wouldn’t send a late-night text unless it was a business emergency—or if he’d been drugged. She dug deeper, curiosity piqued.

Victoria’s mental monologue continued, dripping with delusion. "Once I’m Mrs. Blackwood, I’ll fire that insufferable assistant of his. Lillian Graves has always been too cozy with Evelyn anyway."

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard it hurt. The audacity.

Then, another voice cut in—smooth, amused, and unmistakably Nathan’s. "Victoria’s delusions are almost entertaining. If only she knew I only keep her around because she’s predictable."

Evelyn’s lips twitched. Of course. Nathan’s mind was a fortress, but when he wanted to be heard, he made sure of it. A silent message, just for her.

She switched channels, landing on Serena Whitmore’s frantic brainstorming. "If I can just get Evelyn to sign that endorsement deal, maybe the studio will finally greenlight her series. But she’s so damn picky!"

Evelyn sighed. Serena meant well, but she worried too much.

Then—bam. A new voice, sharp and venomous. "Evelyn thinks she’s untouchable. But everyone has a weakness. And I will find hers."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. The voice was unfamiliar, laced with quiet fury. Before she could pinpoint the source, the connection snapped, leaving her with a gnawing unease.

Who the hell was that?

Her phone buzzed. A text from Nathan: "Stop snooping and get dressed. We have a problem."

Evelyn groaned. Of course he knew.

And just like that, her morning of gossip turned into the start of another mess.

Gabriel and Vivienne had once been the golden couple, adored by everyone who knew them. Their breakup, never publicly explained, led most to assume it was due to the overbearing influence of Claire, Gabriel's notoriously meddlesome mother. The general consensus was that Vivienne had walked away, unwilling to navigate the complexities of such a controlling family dynamic.

Recently, however, after witnessing the surprisingly warm exchanges between Claire and Vivienne on the show, whispers of a possible reconciliation had begun to spread among their friends and fans alike.

Some time ago, Gabriel had reconnected with the production team of the show, hoping to use their platform to stage a grand marriage proposal. Since his appearance was only meant to announce the theme—not for a live broadcast—the production team agreed, eager for the positive buzz it might bring to their program.

At the time, My Acting Skill was mired in controversy despite its soaring popularity, and the director and producer were desperate for a smooth, drama-free finale.

Everyone involved in the production—except the one person who mattered—was informed of Gabriel’s plan to avoid any potential disruption to the show’s carefully curated atmosphere.

"So, Mrs. Harrison knew about this? She actually agreed?" Isabelle asked, skepticism lacing her voice.

Preston nodded. "Yes. She seemed serious, but she didn’t object."

Julian and Genevieve, overhearing the conversation, exchanged knowing glances.

Damn. No opposition? Mrs. Harrison must have warmed up to Vivienne and is open to her becoming part of the family. She didn’t outright reject the proposal, but she clearly thought it was premature—Gabriel hadn’t even fixed things with Vivienne yet. Still, seeing her son take initiative, she chose not to stand in his way.

Gotta admit, Mrs. Harrison is sharp. Proposing under these circumstances isn’t just bold—it’s downright delusional!

Julian and Genevieve shared the same thought. They couldn’t fathom why Gabriel would even consider proposing when they hadn’t reconciled. Did he really think Vivienne would say yes? Was he living in a fantasy?

But hey, I’m curious to see what Gabriel’s got planned. Let’s see what’s going on in that head of his.

Julian and Genevieve barely suppressed their laughter.

The excitement in the air was palpable as they made their way to the stage, surrounded by eager onlookers buzzing with speculation.

Isabelle, however, seemed less than thrilled, sighing heavily.

"What’s wrong, Isabelle?" Evelyn asked, noticing her subdued mood.

"I was thinking about poaching Vivienne," Isabelle admitted, her expression thoughtful.

"Really? Even though she has her own agency?" Julian blurted out, surprised.

"That amateur operation?" Isabelle Laurent scoffed, her manicured nails tapping against her champagne flute. "No offense to mom-and-pop agencies, but let's be realistic here."

She leaned forward, her designer dress whispering against the leather couch. "Vivienne signed with Silver Screen Studios right after graduating—courtesy of her professor's connections. They had a five-year development plan that could've made her A-list by thirty." Isabelle's lips twisted. "But then her uncle and mother swooped in, treating acting like some seasonal fruit stand. 'Cash in while you're young!' they said. Convinced her to ditch professional management for some backyard talent agency."

"She's practically a marionette," Julian Blackwood observed dryly. "No way you'll change her mind when family's pulling the strings."

"Thought so too at first." Isabelle's eyes gleamed like polished onyx. "Then remember her tax audit scandal?" The room murmured recognition. "Here's the thing—Vivienne plays the dutiful daughter, but there's steel beneath that smile. She tolerates their meddling... until she doesn't."

A slow smile spread across Isabelle's face. "This reality show? That's her rebellion. Notice she's barely booked anything else this year? First time in her career she's not chasing paychecks. The family leash is slipping." She snapped her fingers. "That's when we strike. She'll realize she needs real management—not relatives playing agent."

Isabelle sat back, radiating the satisfaction of a chessmaster spotting checkmate three moves ahead.

Vivienne fascinated her. Twenty-six years old with more range than actresses twice her age. Their interactions on set confirmed it—this wasn't some fame-hungry influencer. The girl burned for the craft. With Vivienne and Seraphina Delacroix under her wing? Isabelle could practically hear the Emmy speeches already.

"Seems you've got quite the soft spot for Vivienne," Genevieve remarked, swirling her cocktail.

"For talent with drive? Always." Isabelle's gaze flicked meaningfully toward Evelyn Sinclair. "Give me someone who'll crawl through broken glass for a role over nepo babies any day."

Evelyn stiffened. Was that dig meant for her?

Julian and Genevieve exchanged amused glances. They knew Isabelle was already drafting press releases about Evelyn—the heiress who traded boardrooms for backlots, whose real-life Cinderella story (complete with obscenely handsome husband) would send TMZ into a frenzy.

Isabelle couldn't resist adding, "Seraphina's been with us a week and already booked two Chanel campaigns." Her pointed look at Evelyn said the rest: Meanwhile, some people are still getting lost on the way to set.

The dazzling lights of Hollywood never sleep—constant filming, endless endorsements... It seemed the harder you worked, the more rewards came your way...

#QueenOfHustle

No matter how skillfully you cracked that invisible whip, I wouldn't budge. Because my philosophy was simple: gain without the pain! When Evelyn made this bold but silent declaration, Julian and Genevieve finally burst into laughter.

"What's so funny?" Isabelle asked, eyebrows knitting together in confusion.

Evelyn threw a curious glance over her shoulder, prompting Julian to quickly divert the conversation. "Weren't you determined to poach Vivienne earlier? Changed your mind?"

Isabelle sighed, "It's not that I don't want to. But if today's proposal succeeds, Vivienne will have Mrs. Harrison's backing. She won't need to seek outside collaborations."

At this, Evelyn and the others exchanged knowing smiles.

"What?" Isabelle looked between them, utterly bewildered.

Unable to contain herself any longer, Genevieve blurted, "Vivienne would never agree to it."

"How could you possibly know that?"

Evelyn was genuinely surprised—this was information she'd assumed only she possessed.

Flustered, Genevieve turned to Julian for help. With reluctant amusement, he explained, "Marcus just sent me an... interesting tidbit."

"What?" Both Isabelle and Evelyn leaned in, curiosity piqued.

Julian's lips twisted wryly. "Apparently, Gabriel has a severe gambling addiction. He even borrowed ten million from Vivienne and never repaid it. That's likely the real reason they split."

Isabelle's jaw dropped at the revelation, rendered speechless.

Evelyn nodded slowly. Secrets had a way of surfacing. If Marcus knew, it was only a matter of time before others found out. What if Claudia discovered the truth? Would she connect it to her missing pearl necklace? The thought was both nauseating and absurd. When I see Gabriel later, I might not be able to stop my gaze from... wandering south.

Julian and Genevieve recoiled in horror at her train of thought. Please, for the love of god, don't put that image in our heads!

As they entered the grand hall, their attention was immediately drawn to the stage where spotlights illuminated a sharply dressed man orchestrating the crowd's movements.

Their gazes inadvertently drifted downward, landing precisely where they shouldn't have, as they caught sight of the man's... posterior while he directed the decorators.

###Chapter 156 A Liar And An Addict

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still foggy from sleep, when a sudden, intrusive thought—not her own—flashed through her consciousness.

"If only Nathan knew what really happened at the gala..."

Evelyn bolted upright, her heart pounding. That voice—sharp, calculating—belonged to Victoria Hayes, Nathan Blackwood’s scheming secretary. But how was she hearing it?

She pressed her fingers to her temples, trying to steady herself. The mental intrusion wasn’t just a fluke. Fragmented images flickered behind her eyelids: Victoria slipping a file into Nathan’s desk, a hushed phone call with someone named Preston Whitmore, and—most damning—a whispered conversation about falsifying financial records.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. This wasn’t just gossip. It was a conspiracy.

Downstairs, the clink of porcelain signaled Nathan’s presence. She hurried to the mirror, smoothing her sleep-tousled hair. If she confronted him outright, he’d dismiss her as paranoid. No, she needed proof.

At breakfast, Nathan barely glanced up from his tablet. "You’re quiet today," he remarked, his tone indifferent.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just tired." Inside, Victoria’s voice hissed again: "One more week, and he’ll never suspect a thing."

Her fingers tightened around her coffee cup. One week until what?

Meanwhile, across town, Serena Whitmore scrolled through her phone, pausing at a leaked photo of Nathan and Evelyn at last month’s charity ball. The caption read: "Power Couple or Perfect Illusion?" She smirked. If only they knew the truth.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, leaned in. "The press is already sniffing around. Should we issue a statement?"

Serena shook her head. "Let them speculate. The bigger the scandal, the better our leverage."

Back at the Blackwood estate, Evelyn feigned a headache and retreated to her study. She pulled out her laptop, typing furiously. If Victoria was planning something, there had to be a digital trail.

An hour later, buried in encrypted files, she found it: a series of offshore transactions, all funneled through a shell company named "Holloway Holdings." The last transfer? Five million dollars—dated yesterday.

Her blood ran cold. Nathan’s trust in Victoria was about to destroy everything.

But before she could act, her phone buzzed. An unknown number. The message was brief:

"You’re not the only one who hears secrets. Meet me. Midnight. The old pier."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Who else knew? And whose side were they on?

That night, the pier was shrouded in fog. Footsteps echoed on the wooden planks. Then, a figure emerged—silhouetted against the moonlight.

"Took you long enough," a familiar voice teased.

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "You?"

The smirk was unmistakable. "Surprised?"

The game had just begun.

Gabriel Ramirez carried an undeniable charm, particularly when dressed in formal attire. The impeccably tailored suit hugged his frame, painting the perfect picture of a dashing young man on the verge of proposing—his nervous energy barely contained beneath the polished exterior.

"Never judge a book by its cover," Isabelle Laurent mused, her sharp gaze dissecting him with skepticism. "At first glance, one might actually believe his morals match that pristine appearance." She let out a derisive chuckle. "So now he's here to propose? Has he miraculously reformed, or is this just another desperate bid for what he thinks is love?"

Her laughter dripped with disbelief, making it clear she wasn’t the type to be easily fooled.

"The idea that a gambler can just quit his addiction overnight, or that a man’s word is worth anything—both are complete fabrications. This man embodies both vices, which means this entire spectacle is nothing but a sham," Isabelle analyzed coldly. "He’s trying to manipulate Vivienne."

Agreed. Let’s see what his next move is.

As they settled into their seats, the crowd buzzed with anticipation, eager for the drama to unfold.

Julian and Genevieve Blackwood, standing nearby, exchanged knowing glances, equally stirred by the absurdity of the situation.

I knew it. He’s racked up another gambling debt—this time, a staggering fifty million. And his creditors have already sent threats.

Watching Gabriel on stage, flashing a bashful smile as he accepted congratulations from onlookers, the irony wasn’t lost on them.

Once they’re married, he’ll have full access to Vivienne’s hard-earned fortune, treating her wealth like his personal lifeline.

The audacity. To actually believe someone you’ve deceived would marry you and bail you out.

The Blackwood siblings shared the same thought—Gabriel’s scheme was nothing short of delusional.

Finding seats in the audience, they settled in, their expressions a mix of amusement and disbelief.

"Wait—there’s a live stream?" Isabelle suddenly remarked, her eyes narrowing. "A little warning would’ve been nice. You two, watch what you say," she murmured under her breath.

It was then that Evelyn Sinclair noticed not just the professional camera crew, but several assistants discreetly holding up their phones, undoubtedly broadcasting the event live.

If he gets rejected, it’ll be in front of the entire internet. Is he that confident, or is he banking on Vivienne’s kindness to guilt her into saying yes?

Julian and Genevieve leaned toward the latter—this reeked of emotional manipulation.

Noticing the live feed, Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe quickly dispatched their team to investigate.

The gathering turned out to be a rap crew, assembled to hype up Gabriel Ramirez.

The production team ultimately greenlit the livestream, viewing it as a potential teaser for their next episode. Officially, streaming wasn’t banned, and since it was already underway, shutting it down now seemed pointless.

Evelyn Sinclair pulled out her phone to locate the livestream, realizing it would give her a clearer view of the stage—something hard to discern from their spot at the back of the audience.

At first, the stream, hosted by one of Gabriel’s rap buddies, had barely any viewers. But as whispers spread that this was the set of My Acting Skill and that Vivienne Monroe was the target of the proposal, the numbers skyrocketed.

Everyone flocked in to witness the spectacle.

"These flowers are all Vivienne’s favorites—my boy put his soul into this. Gabriel truly loves her. He even planned a surprise for the proposal. I’ve never seen him pour this much effort into anything before. He’s dead serious about building a life with her," the rapper hosting the stream explained, fielding the barrage of questions about the couple’s status.

The comments flooded in:
"Didn’t they break up?"
"When did they get back together?"
"They’re already getting married?"

"Breaking up doesn’t mean love dies. Besides, Mrs. Harrison has warmed up to Vivienne now," the rapper added, implying that past issues were mostly due to Claire Harrison’s nitpicking.

Hearing this, Evelyn scoffed internally.

Ah, so you’re a gambling addict too. No wonder you’re spewing lies without shame.

Julian and Genevieve Blackwood, also tuned into the stream, watched with a mix of disgust and amusement as the man acted like he was doing his best friend a favor by securing his future wife.

"More importantly, Gabriel already has the blessing of his future in-laws. Right now, Vivienne’s mother and uncle are keeping this a secret from her. Everyone’s waiting for the big romantic moment," the rapper continued, setting the stage for what he hoped would be a fairytale proposal.

The persuasive speech worked—comments poured in, showering the couple with well-wishes.

"They actually agreed? I remember how displeased they were when Vivienne and Gabriel were dating," Isabelle Laurent muttered, confused.

Evelyn found it odd too.

Initially, they’d resisted because they feared Vivienne would marry and slip from their control—no longer their cash cow. But now…

Julian and Genevieve were listening intently when someone suddenly shouted, "Quiet! She’s coming!"

The room fell silent. The overhead lights dimmed, leaving only the soft flicker of candlelight tracing the path.

A melancholic melody filled the air as Gabriel Ramirez began crooning a love ballad.

.

Though his voice was undeniably rich and smooth, to Evelyn Sinclair and the others, his performance reeked of artifice.

Then, a hesitant figure emerged onto the candlelit path, pausing briefly before the encouraging murmurs of the crowd urged her forward.

At the end of the flickering trail of light, a man knelt on one knee.

As the lights blazed back to life and cheers erupted, Evelyn watched as Adriana and Bartholomeo Constantine guided Vivienne Monroe toward the makeshift stage, while Claire Harrison observed silently from the shadows.

The live stream zoomed in, capturing the face of a stunning woman—her beauty natural, but her expression rigid, her complexion ghostly pale, betraying her turmoil.

Gabriel, either oblivious or indifferent to her distress, launched into his plea.

"Vivienne, I was wrong—so wrong. You know how much I love you. I can't breathe without you. I acted rashly, and I hurt you, but I swear—from this moment on, I'll do anything you ask. I've fixed all my problems. Please... give me another chance." His voice cracked with what sounded like genuine remorse.

After his impassioned speech, Gabriel opened a velvet ring box and produced a glittering diamond.

"Vivienne Monroe... marry me." His voice was thick with desperation. "I know you've always wanted a home. Let me be the one to give it to you. We'll have children—a warm, loving family. I swear on my life, this time, I won't fail you."

To an outsider, his words might have sounded like a plea to mend a fractured relationship. But Vivienne, Evelyn, and the Blackwood siblings knew the truth—he was talking about his gambling addiction.

Tears shimmered in Gabriel's eyes, his expression the picture of sincerity.

Evelyn scoffed internally. Damn, he’s good. With acting skills like that, he should be in Hollywood. Just as Isabelle Laurent had said—men were liars. And Gabriel wasn’t just any liar. He was a parasite, determined to drain Vivienne dry.

###Chapter 157 Rejecting The Proposal

The golden rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of amber and rose as Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of the sleek black limousine. The evening breeze carried the faint scent of jasmine, mingling with the crisp autumn air. She adjusted the emerald silk scarf around her neck, her fingers brushing against the delicate fabric.

Nathan Blackwood stood at the entrance of the grand ballroom, his sharp gaze immediately locking onto her. The way the light caught the angles of his face made him look almost ethereal—like a figure carved from marble. His lips curved into a knowing smirk as she approached.

"Running late, as usual," he murmured, his voice a low rumble that sent a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Fashionably late, darling. It's called making an entrance."

Before he could retort, Victoria Hayes materialized beside them, her crimson lips twisted into a saccharine smile. "How charming," she purred, her eyes flickering between them with thinly veiled disdain. "The power couple gracing us with their presence."

Nathan's expression darkened, but Evelyn merely laughed, the sound light and melodic. "Oh, Victoria, always so dramatic. One would think you were auditioning for a soap opera."

Victoria's smile faltered, but she recovered quickly. "I hear congratulations are in order. Your latest project is quite the talk of the town."

Evelyn's fingers tightened imperceptibly around her clutch. "Yes, well, success does have a way of attracting attention."

Nathan's hand settled at the small of Evelyn's back, his touch warm and possessive. "Shall we?" he murmured, steering her away before Victoria could respond.

As they moved through the crowd, whispers followed in their wake. The elite of high society watched them with a mix of envy and admiration. Evelyn kept her chin lifted, her posture flawless.

Serena Whitmore intercepted them near the champagne fountain, her silver gown shimmering under the chandeliers. "There you are," she said, handing Evelyn a flute of champagne. "I was beginning to think you'd stood me up."

"Never," Evelyn replied, taking a sip. The bubbles danced on her tongue, crisp and refreshing.

Nathan's phone buzzed in his pocket. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening. "Excuse me," he muttered before striding off toward the balcony.

Evelyn watched him go, a flicker of unease in her chest.

Serena leaned in. "Everything alright?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Of course. Just business as usual."

But as the night wore on, the tension between them grew palpable. When Nathan finally returned, his expression was unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said quietly.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Here?"

He shook his head. "Not here."

The unspoken weight in his words sent a chill through her. Whatever he had to say, it wasn't good.

And as the music swelled around them, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that their carefully constructed world was about to unravel.

Gabriel's words hung in the air as his gaze settled on Vivienne, brimming with a tenderness that spoke louder than any declaration. He knew Vivienne’s deepest yearnings—her past had shaped them.

Vivienne’s childhood had been shadowed by absence and longing. Losing her father young, she was raised by her mother in her grandfather’s home, a household where sons were prized above all. Her mother poured everything into her uncles, leaving Vivienne starved for affection. Trapped in a world that valued her less, she dreamed of freedom, yet duty bound her to stay, her helplessness a constant weight.

During their time together, Vivienne had once bared her soul to Gabriel. She didn’t crave wealth or status—just a home filled with warmth and love. A partner who’d cherish and stand beside her. And motherhood—a chance to give her children the joy she’d been denied.

Confessing this had taken courage. She wanted Gabriel to see she wasn’t like the starlets chasing fame; she was ready to build a life, fueled by love, not ambition.

Gabriel, though, had deftly sidestepped such conversations. Her innocence about romance had drawn him in—a safety net. Even if she stumbled upon his secrets, she’d never betray him. He knew she’d even support him financially, though he did care for her in his way. Commitment, however, wasn’t on his agenda.

Then Vivienne discovered his gambling. She walked away without hesitation.

At first, Gabriel scoffed, assuming it was about money. The idea that she’d genuinely wanted him—not his potential—seemed absurd.

Only when desperation clawed at him did he recognize Vivienne’s compassion as his last lifeline. So he made his move, certain she wouldn’t refuse.

Vivienne, with her fierce loyalty, would surely shoulder his debts if they married, laboring tirelessly for stability.

As these thoughts swirled, Gabriel’s eyes locked onto Vivienne’s bewildered face. He reached for her hand, the ring glinting—

But Vivienne jerked back, leaving him stumbling, his shock raw.

Her usual softness hardened into a glare of defiance.

The crowd’s stunned silence was deafening.

Nearby, Evelyn Sinclair bit her lip to stifle a laugh. Glancing sideways, she spotted Julian and Genevieve doing the same, while Isabelle Laurent—

Nathan Blackwood watched with a raised eyebrow, his piercing gaze locked onto the unfolding drama before him.

The live stream comments exploded into chaos, viewers scrambling to make sense of Vivienne Monroe’s unexpected rejection.

What just happened?!
Did Gabriel really get turned down?
I thought they were back together!
Is Vivienne playing hard to get? Or is there something else going on?

Vivienne’s voice cut through the murmurs, sharp and unyielding. "What are you even doing? I thought I made myself perfectly clear—we’re over."

Gabriel Ramirez’s charming smile faltered, his voice strained with disbelief. "Vivienne, are you still upset with me? Didn’t you hear what I just said?"

"I heard you," she snapped. "But it doesn’t change anything. We’re done."

Stunned, Gabriel tried another tactic—appealing to her deepest desire. "You… You always wanted a home. I’m offering you one."

"You’re offering, but I’m not accepting," Vivienne shot back, her tone dripping with disdain.

Oh, please. She wants a home, not a sinking ship. What’s his deal?

Julian Blackwood and Genevieve barely stifled their laughter, relief washing over them as Vivienne stood her ground against Gabriel’s hollow gestures.

Gabriel had completely misjudged the psychology of a woman who had been burned before. He hadn’t anticipated that the very sensitivity and wariness born from past betrayals—courtesy of Adriana and Bartholomeo—would become her greatest armor.

Julian and Genevieve exchanged knowing glances, silently cheering Vivienne’s refusal to fall for Gabriel’s act.

Gabriel, meanwhile, looked utterly bewildered, his confidence crumbling under Vivienne’s unwavering resolve.

He remembered their breakup vividly—how he had begged her to keep his gambling addiction a secret, and how she had agreed, despite the media painting her as the villain who left him for another man. Yet, she had never once used his secret against him.

How is this happening? Gabriel thought, frustration boiling inside him. A woman like her should be easy to manipulate! Why isn’t this working?

Just then, two familiar figures stepped forward.

Adriana, her sharp eyes gleaming with disapproval, chastised Vivienne. "Vivienne, when we forbade you from seeing him, you fought us tooth and nail. Now that he’s proposing, you’re rejecting him out of spite? A man like him doesn’t come around often. If you lose him because of your pride, you’ll regret it."

Bartholomeo, his imposing presence looming over the scene, added sternly, "Vivienne, it’s fine to have disagreements, but humiliating him in public is unacceptable. He’s trying to make amends. Don’t throw it all away."

Vivienne’s jaw tightened, but before she could respond—

"It would be utterly thoughtless of you to cause a scene now," Adriana murmured, her voice laced with false concern.

Vivienne froze, stunned by their sudden defense of Gabriel. Her gaze darted between them in disbelief. "You actually want me to marry him? Why?"

This was the same family who had spent years pushing her toward wealthy suitors—yet Gabriel was far from rich.

After a tense exchange of glances, Adriana finally spoke. "We only want your happiness, darling. You're grown now, and as your family, that's all we care about."

Bartholomeo forced a smile, his tone dripping with insincerity. "Gabriel adores you. Knowing you're with him would ease our minds."

Vivienne studied them as if they were strangers. Their sudden "concern" was laughable, especially after the icy silence that had followed her recent defiance.

For a fleeting moment, her resolve wavered. Genuine care from them was so rare that it almost disarmed her—almost. "I... I'm not what he needs," she said firmly, turning to leave.

They caught her arms, their grips deceptively gentle. "Sweetheart, reconsider," Adriana pleaded.

"Gabriel is perfect for you," Bartholomeo added, his voice thick with persuasion.

Nearby, Evelyn and her friends watched in stunned silence.

Isabelle voiced what they all thought: "Would they still be so supportive if they knew Gabriel embezzled ten million? This isn’t about her happiness."

"Disturbing," Genevieve muttered.

Julian scoffed. "Their 'concern' is transparent. They’re underestimating Vivienne."

Evelyn’s lips curled in silent derision.

Her relatives had always prioritized profit over people. But now that Vivienne was financially independent—defying their control—they were desperate. Gabriel’s proposal was their lifeline: no dowry demanded, a betrothal gift promised, and most importantly, a guarantee that marriage would "tame" her back into submission.

It was all so convenient for them.


###Chapter 158: The Juicy Thoughts She Couldn't Ignore

The morning sun streamed through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she sipped her vanilla latte, scrolling through her phone with growing amusement. The entertainment news was particularly scandalous today, and she couldn't help but smirk at the headlines.

"Seraphina Delacroix Spotted Leaving Sebastian Hart's Penthouse at 3 AM," read one particularly juicy tabloid article. Evelyn's perfectly manicured finger tapped the screen, enlarging the blurry paparazzi photo. "Well, well... looks like someone's trying to make Hendrian Cross jealous."

Her phone buzzed with an incoming message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant: "Don't forget we have the script reading with Preston Whitmore at 11. Also, Nathan Blackwood just RSVP'd to the charity gala."

Evelyn's pulse quickened at Nathan's name, though she'd never admit it. She typed back: "Tell Donovan Sharpe I want the emerald Versace for the gala. And find out what Seraphina's PR team is saying about last night."

As she set down her phone, Evelyn's mind wandered to the delicious drama unfolding in Hollywood's elite circles. She knew Seraphina from their days at acting school - the woman had claws sharper than her stilettos. This public spectacle with her ex Sebastian while dating rising star Adrian Cross? Pure calculated chaos.

The intercom buzzed. "Ms. Sinclair? Your car is ready," the doorman announced.

"Be right down," Evelyn called back, grabbing her Givenchy handbag. She took one last glance at the tabloid photos, committing every scandalous detail to memory. These industry secrets were more valuable than gold in her world, and Evelyn Sinclair always knew exactly how to wield them.

The elevator doors closed as she mentally catalogued today's gossip. Who knew what other secrets would reveal themselves before sunset? In Hollywood, the drama never slept - and neither did Evelyn's sharp mind.

The revelation struck Julian and Genevieve like a bolt of lightning—there was indeed a high-stakes game being played behind the scenes, one where Vivienne Monroe was nothing more than a pawn in a carefully orchestrated scheme.

The bitter truth left a sour taste in their mouths. The very people who should have protected Vivienne—her own family and her former lover, Gabriel Ramirez—had instead conspired against her.

It was a twisted alliance, though in reality, it was Gabriel, the cunning gambler, pulling the strings. He had manipulated Vivienne’s relatives into serving his own ends, exploiting their greed and incompetence. Their mismanagement of Vivienne’s agency was proof enough that their minds were consumed by nothing but financial gain.

Evelyn Sinclair’s voice trembled with disgust as she echoed their collective horror.

"I can’t believe their cruelty. They think Vivienne has grown defiant, and they fear that marrying her off to someone of high status would only make her more rebellious. To them, Gabriel—always charming, always polite—seemed like the safer choice. He’s played the mediator before, convincing Vivienne to apologize to them, which they took as respect. So now, at this critical moment, they’ve chosen what they see as the lesser evil—forcing her into marriage with Gabriel to regain control."

Julian clenched his fists. "I won’t even comment on Bartholomeo’s actions, but her own mother? Unbelievable."

Genevieve’s expression mirrored his outrage. The situation reminded them painfully of another family they had encountered—one just as warped in their priorities. The parallels to Celeste’s parents, with their blatant favoritism, were sickening.

But this was worse.

A mother willing to sacrifice her own daughter for the sake of her maiden family? It was unforgivable.

"If Vivienne hadn’t been financially independent, they might have sold her off to pay for her cousin’s wedding," Genevieve muttered darkly.

Julian scoffed, about to dismiss the idea as too extreme—surely no mother would go that far.

But reality proved him wrong.

"Damn it, they actually did something like that!" Evelyn’s voice was sharp with fury. "Back then, Vivienne almost missed her chance to go to university because they thought the tuition was too expensive. The inheritance her father left her? Her mother wanted to use it to send her cousin abroad instead. They pressured Vivienne into settling for a lesser school, telling her it was for her own good—that if her cousin succeeded, he’d support her later. But was that really for her benefit?"

And it didn’t stop there.

They had even arranged for Vivienne to be matched with a wealthy boy from the same university, expecting her to essentially mother him while he studied. Worse, they suggested the dowry be paid in advance—to fund her cousin’s education. Their justification? That her beauty might make her a target, so having a "protector" at school would keep her safe.

It was a masterclass in manipulation—twisting her circumstances to serve their own greed.

Julian exhaled sharply, his jaw tight. "They didn’t just betray her. They tried to erase her future."

Genevieve’s eyes burned with quiet fury. "And now they’re doing it again."

The question hung heavy in the air—how far would they go this time?

And more importantly—how far would Vivienne let them?

Julian and Genevieve stood frozen, completely blindsided by this unexpected turn of events.

Thankfully, they had only dared to manipulate her emotions, disguising their schemes under the noble pretense of "we only want what's best for you." They had never dared to apply direct pressure on Vivienne. So, she had quietly made her own arrangements, secretly enrolling in university and rendering all their carefully laid plans useless.

Only then did Julian and Genevieve manage to catch their breath—but their relief was short-lived, quickly replaced by frustration. Despite all their emotional manipulation, Vivienne hadn’t cut ties with these so-called relatives. She even allowed them to continue influencing her life. Such twisted familial affection was enough to make one’s blood boil.

In the end, severing family bonds was never easy. No one was Vivienne, and no one could truly understand her emotional needs. Perhaps she believed that once she became strong enough, these people would finally step up and act like the family they were supposed to be.

The only consolation was that Vivienne wasn’t completely blinded by familial loyalty—there was still hope she could free herself from their toxic influence.

Even under such intense persuasion, she remained unshaken in her decision. She was determined to take control of her own life.

Seeing that Bartholomeo and Adriana had failed in their prolonged attempts to sway her, Gabriel regained his composure.

With deep affection, he addressed Vivienne, "Vivi, I know you're still upset with me. That’s okay—punish me however you want. Make me promise anything. Just give me a chance. Marry me. We can get the license today. From then on, you can watch me change. Please?"

He then shot his friend a meaningful glance, prompting him to rally the surrounding crowd into chanting, "Say yes! Say yes!"

The atmosphere quickly grew electric, the cheers swelling as people got swept up in the moment. The background music swelled, and the live-streamer projected the feed onto a large screen, showing a flood of comments urging Vivienne to accept.

Adriana and Bartholomeo physically guided Vivienne forward, pushing the tension to its peak. Feeling the crushing weight of expectation, she glanced around—only to realize she was utterly alone.

Evelyn and the others watched in dismay, speechless as they witnessed a capable young woman being metaphorically dragged toward disaster by a mob of people.

Gabriel, well aware of Vivienne’s sensitivity and vulnerability, smirked and said, "Look—your mother, your uncle, my mother, and all our friends… they all believe we belong together."

He gestured pointedly toward Claire, who stood stiffly in the corner, her hair pulled back tightly, accentuating her stern expression. When her son singled her out, she frowned slightly but remained silent.

"I was really hoping to see a real mother-and-daughter-in-law duo on-screen," Gabriel added cheerfully.

Vivienne’s expression flickered as she weighed the consequences. Refusing Gabriel now could damage the fragile rapport she had built with Claire—and worse, there was no telling what recordings might surface later.

Should I just give in to avoid conflict?

The pressure was suffocating.

But deep down, she knew—this wasn’t love.

This was a trap.

Noticing the subtle shift in her hesitation, Gabriel pounced on the moment. "This is being streamed live to millions," he pressed, his voice dripping with false sincerity. "Would you really tarnish such a perfect moment with rejection? Think of how heartbroken our fans would be."

"Vivienne, I love you! Be my wife," he proclaimed dramatically, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Vivienne's face paled. For a fleeting second, she considered playing along—smiling, nodding, and letting the moment pass without a scene. She could always back out later in private. But the rational part of her screamed that silence now would only make things worse.

It was absurd. She felt cornered, yet an inexplicable guilt gnawed at her, as if she were the one being unreasonable.

Before she could gather her thoughts, Gabriel made another attempt to slide the ring onto her finger. This time, Vivienne’s expression hardened. Acting purely on instinct, she yanked her hand back with such force that the ring clattered to the floor.

Gabriel’s face twisted—first in shock, then in barely contained fury. His fingers clamped around her wrist like a vice, his grip unyielding.

Vivienne didn’t struggle. Instead, she lifted her chin and declared, loud and clear, "I said no."

The upbeat music that had been filling the venue cut off abruptly. In the sudden silence, her voice rang out, sharp and unmissable, echoing through both the ballroom and the live stream.

"Vivienne, stop this nonsense!" Gabriel hissed through clenched teeth, his composure cracking.

Before the murmurs of the crowd could swell into outrage, Claire stepped forward, her face a mask of concern. She reached for her son, trying to pull him away.

Then, from the back of the room, a cool, amused voice cut through the tension.

"Interesting. Since when did our laws allow men to force women into marriage on live television?" The speaker—a woman in a sleek black dress—tilted her head, her gaze razor-sharp. "Or is it just that you don’t care what she wants? I’ve heard of this happening in backwater villages, but never in high society. How… quaint."

The room froze.

Gabriel’s grip on Vivienne’s wrist tightened painfully.

And the live chat exploded.

###Chapter 159 Stop Pestering

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still half-asleep, when suddenly—bam—an intrusive thought barged in.

"Oh my god, did Nathan really say that to Victoria last night?"

Evelyn bolted upright, her heart pounding. Wait—since when could she hear other people’s thoughts?

She rubbed her temples, trying to make sense of it. The mental chatter around her was like a radio tuned to multiple stations at once.

"Ugh, I can’t believe Preston still hasn’t called me back," Lillian Graves grumbled internally as she shuffled past Evelyn’s door.

"If Daniel thinks I don’t know about Adriana, he’s dumber than he looks," Sophia Blackwood’s sharp inner voice sliced through the noise.

Evelyn’s jaw dropped. This was not normal.

Then came the juiciest one yet—Nathan Blackwood’s own thoughts, smooth and deliberate, like dark chocolate melting on her tongue.

"Evelyn looks adorable when she’s confused. Should I tell her I’ve known about this mind-reading thing for weeks?"

Her face flamed. He knew?!

Before she could process that bombshell, another voice—crisp and venomous—cut in.

"Time to ruin her little fantasy," Victoria Hayes mused, her mental tone dripping with malice. "Let’s see how she handles this secret."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Whatever Victoria was plotting, it wouldn’t be good.

And just like that, her quiet morning became a front-row seat to Hollywood’s most scandalous unspoken drama.

The sharp remark sliced through the murmurs, throwing Gabriel off balance and granting Vivienne a crucial moment to step back from the tense scene.

The audience, equally stunned, swiveled toward the source of the interruption. At first, they were taken aback by the audacity of someone disrupting a marriage proposal—until they recognized the speaker. Silence fell like a heavy curtain.

In the live stream, fans instantly identified the voice. No camera pan was needed—everyone knew who had spoken. It was none other than the infamous Evelyn Sinclair.

Clarity rushed back to minds clouded by the earlier spectacle.

Even Evelyn couldn’t stay silent anymore!

She already said no! Do you think she’s playing coy?

How does this production team manage to turn everything—on and off stage—into a drama?

I came for a romantic proposal, but ended up watching a forced engagement.

Something felt off from the start. They weren’t even back together, and suddenly—a proposal? That makes zero sense.

To all you surprise proposal enthusiasts—check your standing with the person first!

Do you really think a grand gesture and mood lighting will magically make someone say yes when they’ve shown zero interest?

What’s the difference between this and holding a knife to someone’s throat, demanding they declare love?

Marriage isn’t something you rush into. Get your head straight.

Team Vivienne all the way. There was a reason they broke up—time doesn’t erase that.

Evelyn’s cutting remark ignited a wave of rationality in the live chat. Comments flooded in—She said no!—turning the tide spectacularly.

Adriana, visibly flustered, snapped, "What are you doing? Ruining someone’s special moment? My daughter is just… shy!"

Victor’s expression darkened, his displeasure clear at the intrusion during such a personal event.

Gabriel, scowling at the unexpected challenge—and unaware of his godmother’s fraught history with the Blackwoods—shot back defensively, "I don’t know where—"

"Mrs. Harrison's wishes," Preston Whitmore declared before turning to Vivienne Monroe. "Ms. Monroe, should I call the police for you?"

The blunt interjection caught everyone off guard, shifting the atmosphere further.

Regaining her composure, Vivienne quickly expressed her gratitude, "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood, thank you both for speaking up for me."

She then addressed Gabriel Ramirez firmly. "Even if I were to refuse, after our breakup, there’s no way I could be involved with you anymore. Your current actions are causing me distress. Please stop. I hope I’ve made myself clear enough." Turning to face her family, she asserted, "You don’t have the right to dictate my life. If I say I won’t marry, are you really going to force me?"

The room fell into an uncomfortable silence, thick with tension.

###Chapter 160 reject it completely

Gabriel’s face showed a dawning realization of Vivienne’s unwavering resolve, but his desperation was fueled by the crushing weight of his mounting debt.

He opened his mouth to argue, but Claire Harrison intervened, gripping his arm. "Enough. Any further pestering would be disgraceful."

Gabriel stood frozen, his intentions clear yet stifled by his mother’s commanding presence.

Claire, meeting Vivienne’s gaze, softened her expression and admitted, "Truthfully, I also believe my son isn’t worthy of you. If you wish to reject him, do so without hesitation. There’s no need to concern yourself with our feelings."

Relieved by Claire’s unwavering support, Vivienne gave a respectful nod. Claire then turned to Gabriel. "Clean this mess up and leave with your friends. You’ve already disrupted the event long enough."

Resentment flickered across Gabriel’s face as he glared at his mother, but he complied, knowing any further scene would only deepen his humiliation—especially with the live broadcast still rolling.

To ease the tension, Claire swiftly took Vivienne’s hand and led her away from the stage, heading toward Donovan Sharpe and Preston Whitmore.

"It seems Mrs. Harrison’s affection for Vivienne surpasses even that for her own son," Evelyn Sinclair remarked with a light laugh.

Genevieve Blackwood added, "If Vivienne were willing, I believe Mrs. Harrison would gladly welcome her as a daughter-in-law. Did you see how fiercely she defended her earlier?"

Julian Blackwood stood, signaling the end of the spectacle. "All right, show’s over. Let’s go." Turning, he noticed Isabelle Laurent hadn’t risen yet and called out to her.

Isabelle, phone in hand, informed Evelyn with a hint of reproach, "You’re trending again."

Evelyn paused, then chuckled awkwardly. "Did I do something wrong?"

Isabelle pocketed her phone and responded, "Of course, doing the right thing isn’t wrong—but you really do take risks."

Evelyn understood her concern. Isabelle was hinting at the potential fallout of her actions, suggesting that in the delicate balance of refusal and acceptance, Evelyn might find herself in an awkward position if Vivienne ever reconsidered.

The air remained thick with unspoken tension as the group dispersed, leaving behind the remnants of a confrontation that had exposed far more than anyone had anticipated.

At times, Evelyn found herself taken aback by Seraphina’s impulsive actions.


Preston and Donovan shared similar concerns, wary of potential conflicts that might erupt during filming. Yet, they were relieved that the tension, though palpable, was minor compared to past disasters.

Their biggest worry now? Whether Claire and Vivienne could continue working together without incident.

Soon after, the group gathered to decide on the theme for the next scene.

The choice was made swiftly by drawing lots, prompting Seraphina to quip, "Isn’t the theme ‘home’ a little too on the nose after today’s drama? The internet will feast on this." She smirked, watching the director and producer exchange uneasy glances. "Honestly, watching them squirm is almost entertaining."

Julian and Genevieve bit back laughter, though the absurdity of the situation made it hard to stay composed.

Claire, ever the professional, remained focused, diving straight into discussing the upcoming scene. Vivienne, however, shifted uncomfortably, her unease impossible to miss.

As the behind-the-scenes discussions wrapped up, the group prepared to disperse. They noticed Gabriel and his entourage had already left—except for Gabriel himself, who lingered at the end of the hallway with Adriana and Victor.

Ever perceptive, Evelyn subtly guided her group to avoid direct confrontation, giving Vivienne and Claire space to pass without further drama.

Those familiar with Evelyn’s tactics sensed another spectacle brewing, shuffling their feet in anticipation.

Unexpectedly, it became clear that Claire and Vivienne had also parted ways. Claire strode ahead without hesitation, while Vivienne paused, turning toward Evelyn’s group.

Grateful by nature, Vivienne offered repeated thanks, acknowledging that her actions might have inconvenienced them.

"Make sure you reject it completely," Evelyn advised with a reassuring smile.

Vivienne laughed softly, touched by the encouragement. "I will."

Seizing the moment, Isabelle extended her business card. "If you’re looking to break free from typecasting or exploitation, you might need a professional manager. Consider joining our agency. Right now, our mission is paving the way for actresses." Her tone was light, but the offer was genuine.

Julian nearly choked on his drink at Isabelle’s awkward slogan.

Evelyn, amused, stifled a laugh. "Isabelle, that slogan needs work."

###Chapter 161 The Weight of Regret

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the bustling café, she knew something was off. The air was thick with hushed whispers and stolen glances—all directed at her. She tightened her grip on her latte, her sharp eyes scanning the room.

What are they all staring at?

Then she spotted them—Victoria Hayes and Preston Whitmore huddled in the corner, their heads bent together like conspirators. Victoria’s perfectly manicured fingers tapped against her phone screen, her lips curled into a smirk that made Evelyn’s stomach twist.

Oh, this can’t be good.

Evelyn forced a casual smile and sauntered toward them, her heels clicking against the polished floor. "Morning, Victoria. Preston. Lovely day for some… gossip, isn’t it?"

Victoria’s smirk faltered for a split second before she recovered, flipping her glossy hair over one shoulder. "Evelyn, darling. We were just discussing the latest industry news."

Preston cleared his throat, shifting uncomfortably. "Nothing important, really."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Really? Because it looked like you were dissecting someone’s life with surgical precision."

Victoria’s eyes gleamed with mischief. "Well, if you must know, there’s a fascinating rumor going around about a certain actress and her very married co-star."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Harrison Montgomery and Vanessa Sterling.

She kept her expression neutral. "Rumors are like cheap perfume—loud, obnoxious, and usually fake."

Victoria leaned in, her voice dripping with faux concern. "Except when they’re not. And this one? It’s juicy."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed in her pocket. A message from Lillian Graves:

"Turn on your notifications. The internet is on fire."

Her stomach dropped.

She pulled out her phone and—

Oh, hell.

A grainy photo of Harrison and Vanessa in a very compromising position had just gone viral.

Victoria’s laugh was like nails on a chalkboard. "See? Told you it was juicy."

Evelyn’s mind raced. Natalie Whitaker is going to lose it. And if this blows up, the entire production could collapse.

She forced a smirk, locking eyes with Victoria. "Funny how these ‘scandals’ always pop up right before a big premiere. Almost like someone’s desperate for attention."

Victoria’s smile tightened.

Evelyn turned on her heel, her mind already spinning damage control.

But one thought burned brighter than the rest:

Who the hell leaked this?

And more importantly—

What’s their endgame?

Claire Harrison approached the tense gathering, her sharp gaze immediately assessing the situation. Adriana and Victor Grant greeted her with strained smiles, their discomfort evident.

From across the room, Gabriel Ramirez watched Vivienne Monroe with a mix of longing and frustration before turning to his mother. "Mom, let's all have dinner together later."

Claire's brows knitted in disapproval. "Since when did I raise you to disrespect women like this?"

"But—"

"She had no connection with you, and she wasn't being unreasonable. What gave you the audacity to propose in front of a crowd? You thought you were being romantic, but all you did was embarrass her. That’s not respect—that’s selfishness."

"She humiliated me first by rejecting me!" Gabriel snapped, his voice thick with resentment.

Claire’s expression hardened, disappointment etching deep lines into her face. "What’s happened to you? Have you lost all sense of principle—and common sense?"

It was clear to her that her son had strayed far from the values she’d instilled in him. Once, he had been obedient, if not particularly sharp. Now, he was entangled in petty schemes and misplaced pride.

"Mom, I’m your son. If you like Vivienne too, then why don’t you—" Gabriel’s voice faltered, frustration choking his words.

"Because she’s not someone you can force into submission. I don’t care why she left you. But I know this—you’ve already lost her for good." Claire, with her keen perception, understood that a woman like Vivienne, once resolved, never looked back.

"Claire, about what you said—" Adriana began, attempting to interject, but Claire silenced her with a single icy glance. The authority in her stance left no room for argument.

"Who gave you permission to address me so casually? Are you even her real mother?" Claire challenged, her tone cutting.

Adriana’s face flushed with discomfort. "Well, of course I am."

"Then act like it. I’ve never seen a mother so indifferent to her own daughter’s happiness. You have a remarkable woman in Vivienne—cherish her." Claire’s military background lent her words a blunt, unyielding force, leaving Adriana speechless.

Victor, unable to stay silent, scoffed. "Don’t act like we’re the ones chasing this. It’s your son who’s obsessed with our Vivienne."

Claire merely gave him a dismissive glance before turning back to Gabriel. "Enough. We’re leaving."

Gabriel opened his mouth to protest, but Claire’s stern glare silenced him. The weight of familial duty anchored him, preventing him from making another scene. With one last glance at Vivienne, he followed his mother, his pride wounded but his defiance cowed.

Only when they were finally gone did Vivienne let out the breath she'd been holding. She turned to Evelyn and the others with a relieved smile. "Break a leg on your final performance," she said warmly.

"Don't stress," Isabelle teased, nudging her playfully. "Justice Upholder already ruled in your favor. Case closed."

Laughter rippled through the group, though Evelyn maintained her signature doe-eyed innocence.

Their showdown had made waves, dominating social media trends all day.

Back home, those who'd missed the live drama scrambled to watch the replay of Gabriel's disastrous proposal. Online discussions continued to explode.

Gabriel's supporters from the ranching community rallied behind him, painting Vivienne as the heartless villain who'd crushed his sincere love. They circulated pitiful images of Gabriel drowning his sorrows in alcohol, calling out Vivienne's name in despair. Some of his more zealous fans even dug up old, debunked rumors to smear her.

But the public wasn't having it. The internet swiftly mobilized in Vivienne's defense, shutting down the manipulative narrative.

Enough with the guilt trips. We see right through you!
Even Justice Upholder called you out. Still in denial?
Your heartbreak, your feelings—that's YOUR business. Adults handle their own mess without dragging others into it!
Why post this sob story on Instagram? We're not your therapists!
Looking for sympathy? Try being less entitled and more self-aware.

The original poster quickly deleted their rant under the onslaught of backlash.

The consensus was clear—Gabriel had crossed a line by ambushing Vivienne with a public proposal, and his humiliation was entirely self-inflicted.

Though the public stood with her, the ordeal had visibly drained Vivienne. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, evidence of sleepless nights. Yet she still greeted everyone brightly at rehearsals.

Evelyn checked in and learned Adriana, Bartholomeo, and Gabriel were still trying to pressure Vivienne, but their influence had noticeably waned.

By their next meeting, Vivienne's mood had lifted dramatically, as if a weight had been removed. Claire's mentorship flourished, with Vivienne hanging onto her every word.

When Rebecca arrived as a guest actor, she remarked, "People online were speculating about awkward tension. Clearly, they underestimate women. Since when is women supporting women some shocking phenomenon?"

Preston and Donovan exchanged relieved glances, tension easing from their shoulders. Their relief doubled when the elite writing team finally delivered the long-awaited script—

Not just any script, but one brimming with raw potential and cinematic promise.

Whispers spread through the industry that when the script first landed in their hands, both director Preston Whitmore and producer Donovan Sharpe had been moved to tears. They'd reportedly cheered through their emotions, hearing what sounded like church bells heralding their well-earned retirement after this crowning achievement.

One afternoon, Evelyn Sinclair accidentally witnessed Vivienne Monroe and Isabelle Laurent engaged in an intense conversation near the studio elevators. Isabelle was clearly still passionately pitching her vision, while Vivienne's animated responses and nodding approval showed she was thoroughly impressed by what she heard.

Vivienne had reached a pivotal realization - the time had come to cut toxic influences from her life. Those emotional parasites she'd tolerated for too long. While she'd honor any remaining professional obligations, she refused to let them dictate her future any longer.

During their most recent meeting, Isabelle confirmed everything was nearly finalized. They'd agreed Vivienne would sign the contract immediately after her upcoming theatrical performance.

The chosen script told a deeply moving mother-daughter story. It painted a vivid portrait of maternal sacrifice and a daughter's heartfelt redemption, weaving a tender tapestry of family bonds. More than just a tale of two women fighting to better their lives together, it shattered stereotypes about children from single-parent households.

Vivienne had selected this script with particular care - it mirrored her deepest yearnings. She longed for the kind of unconditional maternal love depicted in the story, the kind that made traditional notions of family support (which her own mother constantly referenced) seem hollow by comparison.

Claire Harrison expressed delight when she learned about Vivienne's script choice and her decision to dissolve her current agency to join Evelyn's collective. She offered full support and encouraged Vivienne to call if she needed any assistance.

The peaceful momentum continued until the day before the live broadcast, when urgent alerts shattered the calm.

Vivienne had been discovered unconscious after ingesting dangerous quantities of sleeping pills, rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

Evelyn and Julian Blackwood, still at the agency when the news broke, were stunned. Isabelle Laurent, who received the alert first, stood frozen by this sudden reversal.

How could someone who seemed perfectly stable yesterday now be fighting for her life?

Isabelle began suspecting Gabriel Ramirez's possible involvement, given the ongoing family disputes about the contract signing. The situation's severity made her consider contacting authorities.

Evelyn's expression darkened as she grasped the implications. Grasping Isabelle's arm firmly, she said, "This appears to be a suicide attempt. We need to get to the hospital immediately."

Julian, caught off guard by Evelyn's sudden declaration, could only stare in shocked silence. Then he heard her silent mental tirade directed at Gabriel:

Damn you, Gabriel Ramirez, you absolute monster!

The tension in the penthouse was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tracing the condensation on the glass. The city lights blurred beneath the weight of unshed tears in her eyes.

Nathan Blackwood watched her from across the room, his jaw clenched. The silence between them was deafening, a chasm neither knew how to bridge.

"You should have told me," Evelyn finally whispered, her voice barely audible.

Nathan exhaled sharply, running a hand through his tousled dark hair. "I didn’t know how."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "That’s rich, coming from you."

His gaze darkened. "Evelyn—"

"No," she cut him off, turning to face him fully. The fire in her emerald eyes burned brighter than ever. "You don’t get to explain now. Not after everything."

The revelation of Nathan’s past entanglement with Victoria Hayes had struck like a dagger to Evelyn’s heart. The woman who had been scheming against her all along—his former lover.

Nathan stepped forward, his voice low and urgent. "It was years ago. It meant nothing."

"Then why hide it?" she challenged, crossing her arms.

Before he could respond, the door burst open. Lillian Graves, Evelyn’s assistant, rushed in, her face pale. "Evelyn, you need to see this."

On the tablet screen, a breaking news headline flashed: "Scandal Rocks Blackwood Empire: Insider Claims Fraud in Latest Merger."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Nathan’s expression turned to stone.

Victoria’s revenge had just begun.

Though Evelyn wasn't entirely certain how she had pieced everything together, she agreed that heading to the hospital first was the wisest course of action.

After all, Isabelle was on the verge of signing a contract with Vivienne, and there was no way she could abandon her now.

Initially, Isabelle had hesitated to let Evelyn and Julian accompany her, fearing they might be caught by the paparazzi. But Evelyn had insisted, leaving Isabelle with little choice. Naturally, Julian followed suit.

Inside the car, Isabelle frantically dialed her contacts, desperate for answers. Yet even those within her inner circle were baffled, utterly clueless about what had transpired. When they heard the news, they were just as stunned as she was.

It didn’t take long, however, for Isabelle to stumble upon fresh scandalous rumors about Vivienne circulating among her detractors on social media.

"These people have no shame—photoshopping images like this. Do they not fear legal repercussions? It has to be the work of some delusional, obsessive haters."

Isabelle couldn’t suppress her frustration, though she didn’t connect the two incidents. After all, baseless gossip was nothing new for high-profile celebrities. Had she already been Vivienne’s manager, she could’ve shut this down in minutes.

Evelyn clutched her phone, her fingers trembling slightly as she scrolled through the damning photos.

One image in particular made her stomach twist—Vivienne sprawled across a bed, seemingly unconscious. It was unclear whether she was clothed, as only a thin blanket covered her most private areas. The rest of her body was littered with unmistakable love bites, the aftermath of an intimate encounter laid bare.

Somehow, the photo had slipped past the platform’s moderators, allowing it to linger long enough to gain traction.

Slowly, the image spread, igniting whispers across social media.

Yet most people dismissed it as an obvious fake. Vivienne had built her career on a wholesome, kind-hearted image—she had never even bared much skin in her acting roles. Surely, this had to be a malicious fabrication, an attempt to tear her down now that she was rising in fame.

Julian had seen the photos too. His brow furrowed as he glanced at Evelyn beside him. He had never seen her this furious—her expression dark, her thoughts eerily silent. She was too enraged to even form coherent words in her mind.

Given the earlier humiliation Vivienne had endured, it wasn’t hard to piece together that Gabriel was somehow involved in her suicide attempt.

As Julian studied the images again, the truth clicked into place. These photos had likely been leaked by Gabriel himself. He’d heard rumors of men who took pleasure in capturing intimate moments with their partners—only for those images to resurface in the cruelest ways.

The risk of exposure was always there.

And now, Vivienne was paying the price.

Perhaps this time, Vivienne was simply that unfortunate.

Upon seeing the photos and the reactions of netizens, Gabriel couldn't believe Vivienne would be so fragile as to take such a drastic step. How had things escalated to this point?

The group arrived swiftly at the hospital and located her room. As they approached, they spotted Adriana and Victor standing outside the door, whispering with troubled expressions.

At that moment, Evelyn let out a mental scoff before her voice dripped with contempt. If Gabriel is a monster, then these two are far worse. If not for them, Vivienne would never have been pushed to this edge.

Gabriel’s curiosity deepened. His phone buzzed incessantly with messages from the family group chat. Everyone had heard the news and knew they were at the hospital.

Under these circumstances, they couldn’t just barge in, but they were desperate to uncover the truth. If necessary, they were prepared to fight for justice.

Adriana and Victor noticed their arrival immediately, their faces darkening the moment they saw Isabelle.

"What are you doing here?" Victor snapped, his tone sharp.

Isabelle didn’t waste time with pleasantries. "Vivienne is about to sign with me. I’m here to see if there’s anything I can do to help."

"Bullshit!" Victor spat. "She would never leave her agency!" It was clear he already knew about Vivienne’s decision—and it infuriated him.

Adriana’s gaze hardened. "This is none of your concern. Leave."

"First, you forced your daughter into an arranged marriage. Now, you’re blocking her friends from seeing her?" Evelyn’s voice was ice. "If you don’t let us in, we’ll have no choice but to involve the authorities."

In truth, Evelyn’s threat held little weight—it was just a bluff. But Adriana and Victor weren’t the type to be easily intimidated, so Isabelle and Gabriel doubted her words would work.

Yet the next second, their faces drained of color, their eyes flickering with unease. Though they still wore stern expressions, they didn’t dare push Evelyn and the others away.

"What nonsense are you spouting? We’re her family! Why would we harm her?"

"Exactly! Don’t think your status in the entertainment industry gives you the right to accuse us. We’re the ones who should be calling the police!"

Their blatant guilt made Isabelle’s expression shift instantly. Without hesitation, she pulled out her phone.

Seeing this, Adriana and Victor panicked, assuming she was dialing the authorities.

"Fine, go in if you must," Adriana relented, her voice tight. "She’s still unconscious anyway."

The moment the words left her lips—

Evelyn Sinclair scoffed as she strode past them, leading the way into the hospital room.

Isabelle Laurent and Julian Blackwood followed closely behind. The moment the door clicked shut, Isabelle could no longer hold back. "Could it really be…?"

Julian cast a glance at Evelyn before murmuring, "They must have done something unforgivable. That’s the only reason they’d act so guilty."

Of course they’re guilty.

When Vivienne Monroe had been at her lowest, desperate for financial help, she had discovered that her life savings—years of hard-earned money—had been secretly funneled to her cousin. Vivienne should have still had those millions, and her mother and uncle had assumed their betrayal would never come to light.

But they hadn’t known the truth—Gabriel Ramirez had already swindled Vivienne out of everything.

With no other options left, Vivienne had turned to them, only to realize her last lifeline had been severed. Betrayed by the man she once loved and the family she trusted, the weight of their deception had crushed her.

Julian clenched his fists as Evelyn’s thoughts echoed in his mind. The sheer fury burning in his chest made him want to turn around and strike down the two heartless figures standing outside.

After everything he’d seen with Celeste, Julian despised parents who failed their children. He swore then and there—when the time came, he would make them pay.

But one question lingered—what had pushed Vivienne to such despair?

Just as they stepped further inside, Claire Harrison appeared from the adjoining room.

"Mrs. Harrison?" the three of them exclaimed in surprise.

Claire nodded in greeting. "I heard the commotion and thought there might be trouble." She had been briefed on the situation with the hospital staff and knew those two would cause problems for Evelyn and the others. That was why she had come personally to escort them.

Adriana and Bartholomew likely still clung to their delusion of becoming in-laws with the Harrisons, so they didn’t protest her presence.

But the moment Evelyn’s gaze landed on Claire, her expression darkened. Without hesitation, she strode forward, her steps sharp with barely restrained fury.

Julian didn’t miss the murderous glint in Evelyn’s eyes.

Then, she stopped dead in her tracks.

Her attention locked onto the figure standing beside the hospital bed.

Gabriel Ramirez stood frozen, gripping his phone so tightly his knuckles had turned white. The news of his beloved taking her own life seemed to have shattered him.

Isabelle frowned slightly at the sight, and Julian found himself wondering if Gabriel had truly leaked those photos by accident—if this tragedy had been an unintended consequence.

But then, Evelyn’s mocking voice cut through his thoughts like a blade.

You disgusting hypocrite. Playing the grieving lover now? When you were scheming to steal Vivienne’s money, did it never cross your mind that she might break?

Julian’s expression hardened instantly as he stared at Gabriel, his earlier sympathy vanishing without a trace.

###Chapter 162 The Hidden Meaning Behind His Gaze

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She exhaled sharply, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. The weight of last night’s argument with Nathan Blackwood still pressed heavily on her chest.

"You’re letting your pride ruin everything," his words echoed in her mind.

A sharp knock at the door startled her. Before she could respond, Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, strode in, clutching a tablet. "Evelyn, we have a problem."

Evelyn arched a brow. "What now?"

"Victoria Hayes just leaked details of your upcoming project to The Hollywood Insider," Lillian said, her lips pressed into a thin line. "And she made sure to twist the narrative—making it sound like you’re difficult to work with."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists. Of course. Victoria had been waiting for an opportunity to undermine her ever since Nathan had promoted Evelyn over her.

Her phone buzzed—Nathan’s name flashing on the screen. She hesitated before answering.

"Evelyn," his deep voice was calm, but she could hear the tension beneath. "We need to talk."

"About Victoria’s latest stunt?" she snapped.

A pause. Then, quieter, "About us."

Her breath hitched.

Lillian discreetly slipped out of the room, leaving Evelyn alone with the storm brewing inside her.

Nathan continued, "I don’t want this to end like this."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Then what do you want, Nathan?"

The line went silent for a heartbeat.

"Fight with me," he finally said, his voice rough. "Not against me."

Outside, the city hummed with life, oblivious to the battle raging between them.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

The choice was hers.

Julian's mind raced as he once again caught Evelyn's resentful inner monologue.

Damn it! He's not feeling guilty about Vivienne at all—he's just panicking because he can't get the money to pay off his debts on time!

Finally, everything clicked into place for Julian.

Gabriel hadn't given up. He was still obsessed with Vivienne. When his marriage proposal failed, he resorted to blackmail.

That meant Gabriel had willingly leaked those photos. He might have even made worse threats, terrifying Vivienne so much that she was willing to pay to make it stop—only to realize she had nothing left.

The sheer cruelty of it made Julian's blood boil. If looks could kill, Gabriel would have been dead ten times over by now.

But Gabriel remained oblivious, his eyes vacant, as if lost in his own twisted thoughts.

"What the hell happened?" Isabelle demanded, turning to Claire.

Claire sighed deeply, her worried gaze fixed on Vivienne lying motionless in the hospital bed. "We don't know much either. She didn’t show up for rehearsal, and when we finally reached her mother, we heard there’d been an accident. We rushed here immediately. But when we asked her mother and uncle, they acted clueless—though they were clearly hiding something. I swear, they had something to do with this." Her voice dripped with disdain.

Isabelle exhaled sharply. "She was always so strong. What could have broken her like this?"

At those words, Gabriel finally stirred. His expression twisted with something akin to distress as he stared at Vivienne’s unconscious form.

Damn it, I can’t take this anymore. What’s that look in his eyes? Resentment? Is he seriously blaming Vivienne for being too weak? Is he pissed that her suicide attempt messed up his debt repayment schedule?

Evelyn was seething.

Before she could even think of how to handle the situation, Julian suddenly stepped forward, moving toward Gabriel as if to greet him.

Then—

Julian "tripped," stumbling on perfectly flat ground. Instinctively, he flung out his arms to steady himself—only to shove Gabriel hard in the process.

Gabriel yelped as he was thrown from his chair, his body slamming into the nearby wall with a loud thud. The impact was so violent that everyone in the room flinched.

Grimacing in pain, Gabriel clutched his wrist, which had already begun swelling and turning an angry red.

"Oh my God, are you okay?" Julian gasped, rushing to help—only to grab Gabriel’s injured wrist and squeeze it harder.

Gabriel howled, his face flushing crimson with agony.

The sudden chaos left everyone momentarily frozen. As the shock wore off, Claire and Isabelle Laurent rushed forward to assess the situation.

"You..." Isabelle was so stunned she could barely form words. How could such an absurd accident happen to Gabriel? The coincidence was too ridiculous to believe.

Had there not been a history of goodwill between them, she might have suspected Gabriel had done it on purpose.

Claire, of course, was heartbroken for her son, but the thought of him orchestrating this never crossed her mind. She had been too engrossed in conversation with Isabelle to notice what was happening. Otherwise, with her sharp instincts, she would have seen through Gabriel’s act. For now, she could only chalk it up to terrible luck.

Only Evelyn managed to react, barely suppressing a laugh. Silently, she gave Gabriel a mental high-five.

No matter what kind of mishap it was, as long as it made this brute suffer, she was all for it.

Gabriel, naturally, was enjoying himself. He couldn’t resist delivering a metaphorical blow of justice to Javier—considering it payback for the pain he had caused. Having just overheard Evelyn’s thoughts, he found the whole situation even more amusing.

In the end, Gabriel had no choice but to summon a doctor to tend to Javier’s injuries—a gesture of goodwill.

After the flurry of activity, Adriana and Bartholomeo entered, attempting to usher everyone out. They were likely worried that if Vivienne woke up, certain secrets might be exposed. After all, they had reputations to uphold.

Just then, Vivienne stirred.

Her eyes fluttered open, dazed, and Isabelle was the first to notice. She quickly stepped forward. "Vivienne? Are you feeling better?"

Claire, her concern evident, moved closer as well.

For a moment, Vivienne seemed lost in confusion before her gaze landed on her mother and Bartholomeo pushing through the crowd toward her. They murmured words of concern and reprimand, yet their eyes refused to meet hers.

"You foolish girl, how could you even think of doing something like this? If you were gone, how would I, your mother, go on living?"

"Exactly, Vivienne! You need to reflect. We’re family—what’s the point of all this drama?"

It seemed the memories came rushing back. Vivienne’s pupils constricted, her eyes slowly reddening. She forced herself upright, her glare locked onto the two so-called family members before her.

The hatred in her gaze was so palpable that even Gabriel, standing nearby, could feel it.

And then he heard Evelyn’s silent lament.

"Some family."

The air grew thick with tension, unspoken words hanging between them like a blade.

What would happen next?

No one knew.

But one thing was certain—Vivienne Monroe was done playing nice.

Compared to being blackmailed, what truly burned in Vivienne's heart was the betrayal from her own flesh and blood. The faceless blackmailer remained a mystery—though she had her suspicions about the leaked photos, never in her wildest dreams would she imagine Gabriel Ramirez was the mastermind.

All she knew was this: in her darkest hour, drowning in despair, too terrified to seek the police's help, she had turned to her family—only to be stabbed in the back by the very hands meant to protect her. The wound ran so deep it might as well have been fatal. How could she not seethe with resentment? How could she not feel utterly hollowed out? In that moment, escape had seemed impossible. But now… she had clawed her way back from the brink.

Adriana and Bartholomeo had never seen such an expression on Vivienne's face before.

It froze them in their tracks.

Adriana reached out, but Vivienne snatched the nearest object—a glass vase—and hurled it at them without hesitation. The shattering crystal mirrored the fracture between them.

"I have no family," Vivienne spat, voice trembling with fury. "You never treated me as one. To you, I'm just a piggy bank—something to drain dry!"

They scrambled back, but not fast enough. Adriana yelped as shards grazed her arm, while Bartholomeo clutched his forehead, a bruise already blooming.

"Have you lost your mind?!" Adriana shrieked, gaping at Bartholomeo's injury. "Attacking your own uncle—"

"Mother," Vivienne interrupted, the word dripping with venom, "I nearly died."

"You brought it on yourself!" Adriana shot back, lip curling. "So desperate for money you'd throw your life away. Pathetic."

Even now, they believed her suicide attempt was over stolen funds—not their betrayal.

Vivienne's face went eerily blank.

Evelyn tensed, ready to intervene, but then Vivienne exhaled—a slow, icy breath. A humorless laugh escaped her. "You're right. I was out of my mind." Her entire body shook, yet her voice was steel. "But I'm awake now. And I swear, every cent you stole? I'll take it back. No more compromises. No more surrender. Try me. Refuse, and I'll drag you to court."

Silence swallowed the hospital room.

Adriana turned crimson. "You—you ungrateful wretch! I'll disown you!"

Empty threats. Death had already stripped Vivienne of fear.

"Good," she said flatly. "Draw up the papers. I'll sign in blood if I have to."

The heart monitor's steady beep underscored the finality in her words.

###Chapter 163 My Grave Misjudgment

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the grand ballroom, all eyes turned toward her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the opulent space, but none of it compared to the way Nathan Blackwood’s gaze burned into her from across the room.

She had expected this event to be just another tedious charity gala—another obligation in her packed schedule. But the second she spotted Nathan, standing tall and commanding in his tailored black tuxedo, her pulse quickened.

Why does he always have this effect on me?

Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s ever-watchful secretary, stood beside him, her lips pressed into a thin line as she whispered something in his ear. Evelyn didn’t miss the way Victoria’s fingers lingered on his arm—a possessive gesture that made her jaw tighten.

Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-loyal agent, nudged her gently. "You’re glaring," she murmured. "Try to look like you’re enjoying yourself."

Evelyn forced a smile, but her attention remained fixed on Nathan. He excused himself from Victoria and began making his way toward her, his stride confident, his expression unreadable.

"Evelyn," he greeted, his voice low and smooth. "You look stunning."

Her breath hitched. Even now, after everything, his words still sent a thrill through her. "Nathan," she replied, keeping her tone light. "I didn’t expect to see you here."

His lips curved into a smirk. "I could say the same about you."

Before she could respond, the lights dimmed, and the orchestra began playing a slow, haunting melody. Nathan extended his hand. "Dance with me."

It wasn’t a request.

Evelyn hesitated, but the challenge in his eyes was too much to resist. She placed her hand in his, and the moment their fingers touched, electricity sparked between them.

As they moved across the dance floor, his grip on her waist was firm, his body pressed close enough that she could feel the heat radiating from him. "You’ve been avoiding me," he murmured against her ear.

Her heart pounded. "I’ve been busy."

"Too busy to return my calls?" His tone was teasing, but there was an edge beneath it—something darker, something possessive.

She swallowed hard. "We both know this—whatever this is—can’t go anywhere."

Nathan’s grip tightened imperceptibly. "Who says?"

Before she could answer, the music swelled, and he spun her in a graceful arc, pulling her back against his chest. The world blurred around them, leaving only the two of them in that moment.

Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the song ended. The lights brightened, and reality crashed back in.

Nathan released her, but his gaze never wavered. "This conversation isn’t over."

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but a commotion near the entrance caught her attention.

Vincent Holloway, the notorious playboy, had just arrived—and he wasn’t alone.

Daphne, his sharp-eyed aunt, followed closely behind, her expression unreadable. But it was the woman on Vincent’s arm who made Evelyn’s blood run cold.

Seraphina Delacroix.

The second-tier actress who had once been entangled with Sebastian Hart—Nathan’s closest friend.

Nathan’s jaw clenched as he took in the sight. "What the hell is she doing here?"

Evelyn didn’t have an answer. But one thing was certain—the night had just taken a dangerous turn.

And the real game was about to begin.

For the first time, Vivienne had spoken with such cutting harshness, leaving her mother utterly speechless. In Adriana’s mind, her daughter would never dare to abandon her—until now.

“What’s all this drama? Once your cousin turns a profit, he’ll pay you back,” Victor snapped, his expression dark with irritation.

Vivienne let out a bitter laugh, her voice dripping with disdain. “That failure? You’re still deluding yourself? I’d bet every last penny is already gone.”

The truth, laid bare, sent a flush of humiliation and fury across Adriana and Victor’s faces.

“So what if he lost money? He can earn it back. Must you make such a scene?” Victor growled.

“That was my money,” Vivienne shot back, her tone icy. “How dare you act so entitled. I won’t waste another second arguing. Leave now. If my money isn’t returned by tomorrow, expect legal action.”

The steel in Vivienne’s voice sent panic coursing through both Adriana and Victor.

Adriana clutched at her daughter’s arm, desperation creeping into her voice. “Vivienne, please—we don’t have the funds. Your cousin invested everything. Even if you dragged him here by the collar, he couldn’t return a cent. Can’t we just move past this? I swear we’ll repay you—just give him time. A year—no, three years!”

Just then, the hospital room door swung open. Gabriel stepped inside, his face ashen, one arm cradled against his chest. His wide, trembling eyes locked onto Vivienne and her parents, lips parting soundlessly.

Evelyn stifled a dark chuckle.

Oh, Gabriel. That look on your face—priceless.

You’ve realized it, haven’t you? Vivienne’s accounts are empty. No matter how hard you try—even if you play the blackmailer with those stolen photos—you won’t squeeze a single dime from her. How does it feel, knowing all your scheming was for nothing?

Julian, too, watched with quiet amusement as Gabriel struggled to form words.

The man’s jaw worked uselessly, his frustration mounting until veins bulged at his temples.

“What—what did you do to her?” Gabriel finally choked out, his voice strangled as he glared at Adriana and Victor.

To an outsider, it might have sounded like protective fury. But Vivienne remained eerily composed.

“Gabriel,” she said coolly, “when we were together, why did you take those photos of me without my consent? Was it you who leaked them?”

The air in the room turned to ice.

All eyes instantly snapped toward Gabriel. Though many in the room remained baffled, realization quickly dawned—Vivienne’s suicide attempt might not have been as simple as it appeared.

"What photos? What do you mean they were taken without your consent?" Claire demanded, her voice sharp with alarm.

Gabriel hadn’t expected Vivienne to recklessly expose this matter in front of everyone.

A flicker of panic crossed his face before he schooled his features into practiced innocence. "Vivienne, I swear I didn’t know. My phone was off earlier—I was swamped with work. The moment I heard what happened to you, I turned it on and saw your messages. I wasn’t ignoring you. I had no idea any of this was going on."

His acting is truly award-worthy, Julian thought bitterly, his fists clenching at his sides.

Vivienne’s gaze bore into Gabriel, heavy with betrayal. "You didn’t answer my question. Why would you do this?"

"Gabriel, what exactly did you do?" Claire’s voice trembled with rising fury.

Isabelle, however, caught on first, her eyes widening in shock. "Wait—are you talking about those scandalous photos circulating online?"

Vivienne flinched, her breath hitching as she turned to Isabelle. "The internet…?"

Isabelle quickly pulled out her phone, showing Vivienne the screen. "They’re just some suggestive shots. Even if they are of you, it’s nothing we can’t handle with some PR. There’s no need for you to—"

To Isabelle, this was just another minor scandal in the entertainment world—nothing worth dying over.

But when Vivienne saw the same photos she’d been blackmailed with, confusion flickered through her. Had her suicide attempt caused such an uproar that the blackmailer backed off?

"Let me see." Claire snatched the phone, her expression darkening instantly. Remembering Vivienne’s earlier words, she whirled on Gabriel, her voice icy. "Did you take these photos?"

Though Claire meant to ask if Gabriel was behind the leak, the guilt-ridden man paled, his legs nearly buckling beneath him.

Adriana and Edward sensed the shift and rushed over to look. The moment they saw the images, their faces twisted in horror.

Adriana gasped, her voice dripping with disdain. "Vivienne, what were you thinking? How could you disgrace yourself like this?"

The room collectively stiffened at her words.

Seriously? Had they not been listening at all? How could they still blame Vivienne when the truth was staring them in the face?

Evelyn couldn’t hold back. "Mrs. Monroe, your bias is showing. You always favor outsiders over your own daughter. It’s like anyone matters more to you than she does."

Adriana blinked, momentarily speechless, but Edward—face flushed with anger—snapped back, "How dare you speak to us like that?"

"What absolute rubbish are you spouting!" Adriana's voice cracked like a whip through the tense air.

"Did I strike a nerve?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her manicured finger tapping the damning photograph. "This evidence clearly shows your daughter was violated in her most vulnerable state. Yet instead of protecting her, you're berating the victim? How... illuminating."

Adriana's face cycled through shades of crimson before settling into ashen gray. "As her mother, I have every right to correct her poor choices! This mess is entirely of her own making."

Nathan exchanged a loaded glance with Gabriel. Though displeased with the younger man, he redirected his fury toward Vivienne. "Such disgraceful behavior!"

"She's a consenting adult in a relationship. Since when is intimacy a crime?" Evelyn countered sharply. "The real offense here is the violation of privacy—being photographed without knowledge or permission."

Gabriel's jaw tightened visibly.

Vivienne, however, cut through the tension like shattered glass. "My only mistake was trusting the wrong man. Therefore, this concerns none of you." Her wild, furious gaze pinned Gabriel. "Save your breath and start liquidating assets. Did you think I'd let sixty million vanish without consequence? Death has already brushed my shoulder—do you imagine I fear anything now?"

Adriana and Nathan gaped at their daughter. They'd anticipated tearful pleas for protection, not this feral defiance that left them speechless.

Vivienne turned her full attention to Gabriel, her disheveled appearance belying the steel in her voice. "Explain this."

Gabriel swallowed hard. "Vivi, I swear I never intended—"

"Save your oaths for someone who still believes them," she spat.

His fingers twitched toward her before curling into fists. "Those photos... I took them privately when we were together. My phone was stolen weeks ago—this must be how they leaked. I'd never—"

Vivienne's bitter laugh cut him off. "Oh, but there's more." She pulled out her phone with trembling hands. "They sent videos too. First the photos as warning, then a sixty-million-dollar demand. Their terms were quite explicit—pay or they'd flood the dark web with footage, ensuring I'd never show my face in decent society again."

The blood drained from Gabriel's face as Vivienne continued, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "Tell me, Gabriel—how exactly does one accidentally film their lover sleeping?"

###Chapter 164 I Choose To Call The Police

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the same line for the fifth time.

Why can't I focus today?

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, flashed on the screen:

"Nathan Blackwood just arrived at the studio. He's early."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. She hadn't seen Nathan since their explosive argument last week—the one that had left her questioning everything.

Swallowing hard, she typed back:

"Tell him I'll be there in twenty."

She tossed her phone onto the couch and hurried to her closet, her fingers skimming over designer dresses before settling on a sleek black jumpsuit—powerful, yet understated. If she was going to face him again, she needed every advantage.

The studio lot was buzzing when Evelyn arrived, the air thick with the scent of fresh coffee and anticipation. Crew members darted between sets, their voices blending into a familiar hum.

And then she saw him.

Nathan stood near the craft services table, his broad shoulders accentuated by a tailored navy suit. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he’d been running his hands through it—a habit she knew well.

He turned, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers.

For a heartbeat, the world stilled.

Then, Victoria Hayes—Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary—stepped between them, her crimson lips curling into a smirk.

"Evelyn," she purred. "How lovely of you to finally join us."

Evelyn forced a smile, though her nails dug into her palms. "Victoria. Always a pleasure."

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but before he could speak, Preston Whitmore, the director, clapped his hands.

"Places, everyone! We're running behind."

As the crew scrambled into position, Nathan leaned in, his breath warm against Evelyn’s ear.

"We need to talk."

The words sent a shiver down her spine.

But before she could respond, Donovan Sharpe, the producer, called out, "Evelyn, Nathan—we’re starting with your scene. Now."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Whatever Nathan wanted to say would have to wait.

For now, they had a performance to deliver.

And she was determined to make it unforgettable.

Sixty million! You're absolutely ruthless, aren't you? Not only were you planning to pay off the fifty-million gambling debt, but you were also trying to squeeze an extra ten million out of her to use as your own stake, weren’t you?

At the time, Evelyn had skimmed through the information quickly, missing this crucial detail. The more she learned about this despicable man, the more disgusted she became.

Nathan was equally revolted, but he couldn’t vent his frustration openly. Instead, he kept ranting in their private group chat, spreading his anger among the others.

Sixty million was no small sum—it was nearly enough to wipe out all of Vivienne’s savings. Yet, Vivienne had no choice but to pay.

At first, Isabelle and the others had assumed it was just explicit photos—something that could be handled discreetly within the country.

But now, they were hearing there might be videos—secretly recorded ones—that had driven Vivienne to the brink of despair, pushing her to take her own life. One could only imagine how vile those videos must have been.

If such footage were leaked, domestic internet authorities might suppress it quickly, but not before it circulated for a short while.

If it had just been that, perhaps Vivienne wouldn’t have completely broken down so suddenly.

But the blackmailer had been vicious in his threats.

He had also threatened to sell the videos to foreign websites, ensuring they would become a scandal that would haunt her forever.

At her core, Vivienne was deeply traditional. The thought of her private moments being distributed as pornography was more than she could bear.

A woman with a stronger will might have dared to call the police and face it head-on, but Vivienne hadn’t had that courage at the time. She hadn’t wanted to confront it—she just wanted it to disappear. Unable to track down Gabriel for answers, she had instinctively turned to her family, only to find herself betrayed.

She was utterly alone, with no one to help her. In that moment, despair had crushed her will to live.

And now, here she was, questioning the very man who had caused her so much pain, completely unaware that it had all been a scheme—a cruel ploy to extort money from her.

Faced with the interrogation, Gabriel looked deeply troubled. "I swear, I never thought it would go this far. I never meant for any of this to happen. Vivienne, I—"

"You worthless scum!" Before he could finish, Claire didn’t hesitate. She lunged forward and struck him twice across the face with such force that he stumbled and fell to the ground.

Blood trickled from the corner of Gabriel’s mouth as he stared up at his mother in shock. Even at her angriest, she had never hit him like this before.

"How could I have raised such a fool? Get on your knees and beg Vivienne for forgiveness!" Claire knew the gravity of the situation—this wasn’t just some petty scandal. It was something that could ruin a life. How could a girl as brilliant and kind as Vivienne endure such humiliation?

The weight of the truth pressed down on them all. The damage had been done, and now, they had to face the consequences.

"Oh God, this is catastrophic! What in the world are we supposed to do now?" Adriana immediately burst into tears, her wails piercing the tense air.

Gabriel’s eyes darted quickly before he spoke. "So... Vivienne, this explains why you’ve been asking us for money. But even so, it’s too late. We can’t possibly gather that much cash now. At this point, wouldn’t it be better to just... let it go? You’re an actress, after all. Actors take on all kinds of roles, right? Think of it as a bold career move. Besides, if this scandal blows up, it might actually boost your fame. Haven’t you heard of celebrities overseas who’ve skyrocketed to stardom because of leaked tapes?"

"You seem awfully knowledgeable about this," Isabelle Laurent sneered. "Why don’t you volunteer to star in one yourself? I’d be happy to make you famous."

"How could I—" Gabriel choked on his words, immediately falling silent under Vivienne’s murderous glare. "It’s not like we have any other choice, do we?"

Meanwhile, Gabriel, forced to kneel on the floor, desperately pleaded, "Vivienne, you can’t let those videos get out. You know I don’t have that kind of money. Otherwise, I’d help you solve this problem myself. Please, think of another way—maybe borrow from someone?"

As he spoke, his gaze flickered toward Julian and Evelyn.

In that moment, both of them felt like prey marked by a predator.

Are you out of your mind? Do I look like I have that kind of money? You dare target me? You must have a death wish!

Hearing Evelyn’s furious thoughts, Julian scoffed internally, amused by Gabriel’s sheer audacity.

Before either of them could respond, Claire Harrison spoke up. "So, it turns out my son is the one responsible for this mess. If you’re serious about handling it, I’ll cover the expenses."

Yet, Claire didn’t suggest calling the police. No one knew what would happen if they involved the authorities. The culprit might be caught, but what if the videos were leaked before then?

As outsiders, they couldn’t gamble with the futures of those involved. Still, since this was her son’s doing, she was determined to take responsibility.

Everyone turned to Claire in surprise.

Gabriel froze for a long moment before finally lowering his head, as if resigned to this solution.

What a stellar son you are! First, you swindle your ex-girlfriend, and now you’re swindling your own mother. As long as someone pays your debts, it doesn’t matter who gets hurt, does it?

Julian smirked inwardly after catching Evelyn’s scathing thoughts. They said gamblers had no conscience—willing to betray even their own flesh and blood. Now, he was witnessing it firsthand.

If there had been another way, Gabriel would’ve happily drained his mother dry, squeezing every last penny from her. Julian suspected the so-called "sixty million" was just the maximum amount Vivienne could afford—a number Gabriel had pulled out of thin air.

But now that the truth was out, they couldn’t let this spiral further. The question was—how?

Finisher

Julian was at a complete loss, his mind racing as he turned to the group chat for possible solutions. The moment he opened it, chaos greeted him—a storm of curses and insults that revealed the darkest sides of human nature.

Among the torrent of messages, only Nathan responded with clarity: If this is all a setup, then the evidence must still exist. The videos and photos are likely still in his possession. Vivienne will probably call the police. To stop Gabriel from doing anything reckless, we need to secure those files first.

Julian froze for a second before scrambling to search for Gabriel’s phone. But then a chilling thought struck him—what if Gabriel had backups stored elsewhere?

At that moment, Evelyn’s voice echoed in his mind.

Call it luck or misfortune, but at least those compromising videos Vivienne feared haven’t been leaked yet. They’re all still on Gabriel’s phone. He just manipulated the footage to frame someone else and sent snippets to those haters to intimidate Vivienne. If we arrest Gabriel now, everything can be contained. But if we don’t… that’s the real problem. Should we follow Claire’s advice? Should we build an airtight blackmail case before making a move? We can’t risk him getting desperate and selling those videos—he’s absolutely capable of it. Or… should we just destroy the phone? But then we’d lose all evidence to prosecute him.

Nathan’s words, paired with Evelyn’s reasoning, suddenly clicked in Julian’s mind. He realized with certainty that all the incriminating material was still on Gabriel’s device.

Nathan wasn’t suggesting they destroy the evidence—he meant they had to secure it. Because without it, they’d have no way to bring this scoundrel to justice.

To prevent Gabriel from acting out of desperation, they needed to take control of his phone first, then let the authorities handle the rest. But how could they do that without making it obvious they already knew the truth?

Evelyn was still deep in thought when Vivienne’s voice cut through the tension.

"No need to overthink it. I’ve made my decision—I’m calling the police."

Julian’s stomach dropped. Nathan had predicted this. Wouldn’t this just push Gabriel into a corner?

Isabelle Laurent nodded slowly. "Honestly, reporting this is the right move. If he’s blackmailing you once, he’ll do it again. But… Vivienne, are you really prepared for the consequences? This could ruin your career."

Vivienne’s eyes shimmered with quiet resolve, though a shadow of sorrow lingered in them. "I’m sorry, Isabelle. I can’t sign the contract with you right now."

Who knew what the future held? But one thing was certain—she refused to surrender to fear. She wouldn’t let vile men like Gabriel dictate her life. She was ready to face whatever storm came next.

"No!" Gabriel suddenly lurched to his feet, panic twisting his features. "My mother is offering to help you! Why won’t you just accept it? If those videos get out—"

"Relax," Vivienne cut in coolly. "The angles in those clips don’t even show me clearly." The moment the words left her lips, she frowned slightly, as if realizing something didn’t add up.

"That’s not what I care about!" Gabriel snapped, desperation sharpening his voice. "I care about you. After everything we’ve been through, how can you just—"

The tension in the room was palpable as Gabriel Ramirez's grip on his phone tightened. His usually composed features were now strained with barely concealed frustration. "Vivienne, think about this rationally," he urged, his voice low but edged with desperation. "If they realize you're willing to go this far—even to the point of risking your life—they'll back down. This will be the last time. Consider it buying your peace."

Vivienne Monroe, however, stood her ground, her dark eyes burning with a resolve that sent a chill down his spine. "I've already stared death in the face once," she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "I'm not afraid of them. I want justice, Gabriel. I want them to pay for what they did to me."

Gabriel's patience finally snapped. A dangerous glint flickered in his gaze, one that Vivienne had never seen before. "Then we wait," he countered sharply. "There might still be a way to turn this around without destroying everything."

But Vivienne had made up her mind. With a slow, deliberate motion, she reached for her own phone, her fingers hovering over the screen. "No more waiting," she said softly. "I'm calling the police."

Gabriel's breath hitched. The game had just changed.

###Chapter 165 You Haven't Deleted Those Photos

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her latte, scrolling through her phone absentmindedly—until a particular headline caught her eye.

"Seraphina Delacroix Spotted Leaving Sebastian Hart’s Hotel at 3 AM—Are They Rekindling Their Flame?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Oh, this is too good.

Her mind-reading ability, usually a curse, was about to become her favorite pastime.

Across the city, Nathan Blackwood sat in his sleek office, reviewing contracts. His phone buzzed—a message from his sister, Sophia.

"Did you see the news? Seraphina and Sebastian? Again?"

Nathan sighed. He had no interest in celebrity gossip, but Sophia lived for it. Before he could reply, another message popped up.

"Lillian just sent me screenshots of Seraphina’s private texts. This is JUICY."

Nathan frowned. Lillian Graves, Evelyn’s assistant?

Evelyn, meanwhile, had already tuned into Seraphina’s thoughts.

"Ugh, why does the press always twist things? I was just picking up my earrings! Not everything is a scandal!"

Evelyn smirked. Sure, sweetheart. And I’m the Queen of England.

Then, another voice cut in—Sebastian’s.

"If Danielle finds out about this, she’ll kill me. Why did I even agree to meet her?"

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Oh-ho. Someone’s in trouble.

She quickly texted Lillian: "Get me everything on Sebastian and Danielle. Now."

Nathan’s phone buzzed again. This time, it was Marcus Donovan, his brother Julian’s agent.

"Heads up—Evelyn’s digging into Seraphina’s mess. You know how she gets with drama."

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. Of course she was. Evelyn had a knack for uncovering secrets, and once she started, she wouldn’t stop until she had the full story.

He typed back: "Keep an eye on her. And for God’s sake, don’t let Julian get involved."

Evelyn, now fully invested, had switched to listening in on Danielle’s thoughts.

"That idiot. I told him to stay away from her. Now the whole world thinks they’re back together?"

Evelyn grinned. This is better than reality TV.

Then, a new voice entered the mix—Adrian Cross, Seraphina’s current boyfriend.

"If she thinks I’m just going to ignore this, she’s got another thing coming."

Evelyn gasped. Oh, this is about to explode.

She quickly dialed Preston Whitmore, the director of Seraphina’s latest film.

"Preston, darling, you might want to reschedule tomorrow’s shoot. Things are about to get… messy."

Nathan, sensing the impending chaos, decided to intervene. He called Evelyn.

"Whatever you’re planning, stop."

Evelyn feigned innocence. "Me? Planning? Nathan, I’m just an innocent bystander."

"Bullshit. You’re about to set Hollywood on fire."

She laughed. "Maybe. But think of the entertainment value."

Nathan sighed. "Just… try not to get sued."

Evelyn winked, even though he couldn’t see it. "No promises."

By noon, the tabloids were ablaze with fresh rumors, leaked texts, and a very public shouting match between Adrian and Sebastian outside a Beverly Hills café.

Evelyn reclined on her sofa, sipping champagne.

Best. Day. Ever.

Meanwhile, Nathan buried his face in his hands.

Why do I even bother?

Gabriel knew he needed to stall for time. The perfect moment would come when he could intimidate Vivienne, stopping her from doing anything reckless.

"Gabriel, what are you talking about?" Claire suddenly spoke up, her voice sharp. "We would never negotiate with a criminal."

"Mom, this isn't the time—" Gabriel cut in, but he couldn’t stop her.

Claire took Vivienne’s hand, her expression softening. "Sweetheart, I’ve said it before. This mess started because of Gabriel, so it’s our family’s responsibility. If you want to pay to settle this, I’ll provide the funds. If you’d rather go to the police, leave it to me. I may not have many talents, but I do have military connections. I promise you, the culprit won’t escape. But…" She hesitated. "I should warn you—I can’t guarantee those photos or videos won’t leak before then. Desperate people do desperate things."

Though Vivienne resented Gabriel, she couldn’t bring herself to direct that anger at Claire. Hearing those words, her eyes welled up. That an elder was willing to step forward and handle everything for her—it was more than her own family had ever done.

Unlike them…

"Thank you, Mrs. Harrison," Vivienne said firmly. "I want to call the police."

Lillian nodded, already pulling out her phone.

Gabriel’s face twisted instantly.

Hah. Didn’t see this coming, did you, Gabriel? The one to bring you down isn’t your ex-girlfriend—it’s your own mother. A bitter smirk curled Vivienne’s lips. But I wonder… What will Mrs. Harrison do when she finds out the real culprit is her precious son?

Gabriel didn’t give Claire the chance to dial. He snatched the phone from her grip. "No, Mom!"

"What the hell are you doing?" Claire snapped.

Isabelle frowned, studying Gabriel’s erratic behavior. "Gabriel, Vivienne already said you’re not in the videos. This doesn’t affect you. And let’s be honest—you’re not her boyfriend anymore. You don’t get a say in this."

Vivienne met his gaze, her stomach twisting. Even now, after everything, he still acted like some possessive ex who couldn’t stand the thought of other men seeing her body.

Then Evelyn spoke, her voice cutting through the tension like a blade.

"Are you afraid the police will come for you if she reports this?"

Gabriel’s composure shattered. "What the hell are you talking about? Why would they come for me? This has nothing to do with me!"

You’re panicking. You’re actually panicking.

Claire’s brows furrowed as she took in her son’s odd behavior. "Gabriel… why are you so worked up?"

Evelyn arched a perfectly sculpted brow, her lips curling into a knowing smirk. "My, my, why so defensive? The compromising media was leaked from your device. If authorities investigate, isn't it standard procedure to examine your electronics?" She tilted her head, feigning concern. "I merely suggested sparing you bureaucratic hassles. But your reaction... one might think you're hiding evidence with police sirens already wailing outside."

Gabriel's fingers twitched near his blazer pocket. The man might as well have worn a neon sign flashing Guilty.

While Evelyn maintained an expression of playful innocence, Gabriel's face cycled through emotions like a malfunctioning kaleidoscope - panic, fury, then forced calm.

Julian barely suppressed a laugh. His sister-in-law was a maestro of psychological warfare, dangling truth just beyond reach while maintaining deniability. When he noticed Gabriel's telltale sweat stains, he pounced. "Fascinating. Summer in October? Or perhaps..." His gaze dropped meaningfully to Gabriel's clenched fists.

Perfect. Evelyn mentally applauded. With Julian's unexpected assist, they might corner Gabriel before he could destroy Vivienne's reputation further.

Neither noticed Julian's phone blinking urgently on the side table.

The tension thickened as speculative glances ricocheted around the room. Claire Harrison frowned at her son. "Gabriel, what aren't you telling us?" Her maternal instincts warred with dawning horror - her golden boy couldn't possibly be involved in something sordid. Could he?

Gabriel's composure shattered. "This is absurd!" He wheeled on Evelyn, spittle flying. "What possible motive would I have to harm Vivienne? Because I misplaced my phone, I'm suddenly a criminal mastermind?"

Julian's chuckle was ice-cold. "Interesting choice of words. I merely wondered..." He stepped closer, invading Gabriel's space. "...if your panic stems from still having those private files. After all, only the guilty fear scrutiny."

Gabriel's hand jerked toward his inner pocket before he caught himself. "Everything's deleted!" he snapped.

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Then you won't mind proving it." She extended her palm. "For Vivienne's sake - and your own credibility."

The room held its breath as Gabriel's jaw worked soundlessly. When he finally spoke, each word dripped venom. "Don't. Push. Me."

Evelyn blinked with exaggerated innocence. "Darling, why resist such a simple request between... friends?" The pause before the last word hung like a guillotine blade.

Vivienne Monroe and Claire Harrison exchanged bewildered glances. After everything that had happened, they had assumed Gabriel Ramirez would have deleted those compromising photos and videos immediately. What kind of person would keep such incriminating evidence, knowing full well the risks if his phone fell into the wrong hands?

Yet, judging by Gabriel’s defensive reaction—his stiff posture, the way his fingers twitched toward his pocket—something wasn’t right.

Isabelle Laurent narrowed her eyes. In this industry, she had seen it all. She already knew about Gabriel’s gambling debts and reckless behavior. But now, a darker suspicion took root in her mind.

Had this entire ordeal been staged?

With a sharp inhale, Isabelle spoke up. "The person in those photos and videos is Vivienne. Taking them without consent is already illegal. You claim they’re deleted, but without proof, we have every right to verify that ourselves… unless you’re lying."

Gabriel flinched.

Vivienne’s expression darkened. For the first time, she allowed herself to see the man she had once loved in the worst possible light.

This wasn’t just about gambling or unpaid debts.

Claire’s voice turned icy. "Hand over your phone."

Gabriel’s jaw clenched. "You’re all being irrational. I won’t entertain this nonsense any longer. My phone is private property, and I won’t show it to anyone." With that, he spun on his heel and strode toward the exit.

He was running.

This was exactly what Evelyn Sinclair and Julian Blackwood had feared. Legally, they had no grounds to stop him.

But they couldn’t let him leave.

Before Gabriel could reach the door, three sharp knocks echoed through the room. Without waiting for an answer, the door swung open.

"Police. We’re here to investigate a case."

A deep, authoritative voice cut through the tension as two uniformed officers stepped inside.

The moment Gabriel saw them, his face paled. Instinct took over—he bolted, shoving past the officers in a desperate bid to escape.

The sudden movement startled the policemen. The younger officer reacted instantly, grabbing Gabriel’s arm and twisting it behind his back in one fluid motion. Within seconds, Gabriel was pinned face-first against the floor.

"Identify yourself! What are you trying to pull? Handcuff him!"

No one had expected this turn of events.

The room fell silent.

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen in shock. She hadn't dialed the police—she was certain of that. And since she had been present the entire time, no one else could have slipped away to make the call without her noticing.

More importantly, without the victim's explicit consent, who would dare take such a reckless step?

Her mind raced, replaying the events of the past hour. Every face, every whisper, every movement—nothing had seemed out of place. Yet here they were, the distant wail of sirens growing louder by the second.

A cold realization settled in her chest.

Someone had betrayed her.

And worse—they had done it right under her nose.

The question was… who?

Her fingers tightened around her phone, the screen still displaying the damning evidence—photos she had thought were long deleted.

Nathan Blackwood’s voice cut through her spiraling thoughts, sharp and accusing.

"You kept them."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

His gaze burned into her, dark and unreadable. "After everything, you still have those photos."

She opened her mouth to deny it, but the proof was right there, glaring back at her in high definition.

And now, with the police on their way, those very images could destroy everything.

The sirens were deafening now.

Time was running out.

###Chapter 166 Take Them All Away


The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she scrolled through her phone, her fingers pausing over a particularly juicy tabloid headline. The gossip columns were buzzing with fresh scandal, and Evelyn couldn't help but smirk.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman—Is His Engagement to Evelyn Over?"

She rolled her eyes, tossing the phone onto the plush couch. The media loved twisting the smallest interactions into full-blown dramas. Nathan had been at a business dinner, for heaven’s sake. The "mystery woman" was just his new investor, Victoria Hayes—though Evelyn would never admit how much that woman grated on her nerves.

A soft chime from her laptop drew her attention. Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, had sent over the latest script revisions. Evelyn skimmed the notes, but her mind kept drifting back to the tabloid nonsense.

"What if it wasn’t just business?" a traitorous voice whispered in her head.

She shook it off. Nathan wasn’t the type to stray—not after everything they’d been through. Still, the seed of doubt had been planted, and Evelyn hated how easily it took root.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Serena Whitmore, her agent.

Serena: "Saw the headlines. You okay?"

Evelyn typed back quickly.

Evelyn: "Please. Like I’d let some trashy gossip rag ruin my day."

But even as she sent it, her fingers tightened around her phone. The article had mentioned Nathan’s past—his first love, Cassandra, and how she’d recently returned to the city. Coincidence? Evelyn wasn’t so sure.

Downing the rest of her coffee, she made a decision. If Nathan had something to hide, she’d find out. And if the media wanted a scandal? Well, she’d give them one they wouldn’t forget.

It wasn’t until Julian greeted one of the officers that the room snapped back to reality.

"Daniel?"

The striking detective who had made the arrest stood, cuffing a bewildered Gabriel from behind. With a broad grin, he said, "Julian, long time no see."

His sharp, hawk-like gaze then swept over Evelyn, but he merely gave a curt nod—nothing more than a perfunctory acknowledgment.

Evelyn had been admiring the officer’s striking looks—his chiseled features could easily grace a magazine cover. If he ever went live, viewers would undoubtedly swoon. But the moment she noticed his familiarity with Julian and his cold demeanor, she studied his face more closely, rifling through her memories.

Ah, right. Daniel Wright. One of Nathan’s closest friends. They, along with Cassandra, were university classmates. Daniel shipped them hard and knows the real reason behind our marriage… No wonder he’s so icy toward me. Come to think of it, he stopped visiting the Blackwood estate after the incident—probably because he thinks the Blackwoods forced Nathan into this marriage without considering his happiness.

Listening to her thoughts, Julian suppressed a wince. He hadn’t expected Evelyn to be so well-informed. Running into Daniel here, though—that was unexpected.

"Why are you here?" Julian asked.

"Didn’t you call the police?" Daniel tapped his phone pointedly.

Julian blinked, quickly checking his own device. Earlier, he had casually mentioned to the group that Evelyn had uncovered all the evidence on Gabriel’s phone. That was when Nathan had finalized the plan.

The strategy was simple: strike while Gabriel was still in the dark. Call the cops, catch him off guard, and haul him in with the evidence. Once that was done, the problem would be solved.

Coincidentally, Daniel had just wrapped up another case when Nathan reached out directly, asking him to handle this personally.

Nathan had subtly hinted that, based on his own discreet investigation, Gabriel might be playing the victim while actually being the mastermind. But they couldn’t voice that suspicion outright—so he’d asked Daniel to conduct his own inquiry. There was only one condition: the moment the culprit was caught, the phone had to be secured as evidence—without any further harm to the victim.

Familiarity made things smoother. Daniel trusted Nathan’s judgment implicitly, so he immediately pegged Gabriel as the prime suspect—effectively resolving Evelyn and Julian’s concerns.

What they hadn’t expected was for Gabriel to be this much of an idiot. He’d put on a full-blown resistance act before anything even happened, nearly turning himself into a fugitive on the spot.

Since things were already in motion, Julian seamlessly played along.

"Ah, my bad," he said smoothly. "I heard you were calling the cops, so I drafted a message to help Ms. Sinclair."

Damn! Julian, you're brilliant, and your timing couldn't be more perfect! As if fate had intervened, we even knew this person, so a little conversation would smooth everything over, right?

Feeling a twinge of guilt, Julian graciously accepted the praise, silently apologizing to his older brother for stealing the spotlight.

Turning to the stunned onlookers, he asked, "Since the police are already here, will you file a report, Ms. Monroe?"

Vivienne hadn’t yet recovered from the wave of suspicion that had just crashed over her. She always held an extra ounce of caution when dealing with law enforcement. Quickly, she pulled out her phone, earnestly recounting the sequence of events.

"So, the photos were leaked from your phone?" Daniel Wright looked directly at Gabriel.

Gabriel had regained his composure and was already resisting. "It was an accident. Why are you arresting me?"

Claire couldn’t help but step forward, unable to bear watching her own son being taken away.

"You’ve got it all wrong. From now on, you’re the prime suspect." Without wasting a second, Daniel immediately confiscated Gabriel’s phone as evidence.

"What are you doing?!" Gabriel nearly shrieked, unable to believe how quickly things had spiraled out of control.

"The prime suspect?" Claire gasped in shock.

"Exactly." Daniel’s tone was firm. "In cases like this, the perpetrator is usually someone close to the victim. And his claim about losing his phone? That’s just his side of the story. If we can find proof that he needed a large sum of money urgently, it gives him motive to stage a fake extortion. For example… maybe he has some bad habits or financial troubles?"

"Does gambling count?" Isabelle Laurent chimed in at the perfect moment.

That single sentence struck like lightning. The secret Gabriel thought was buried, the one his ex-girlfriend had sworn never to reveal, was suddenly laid bare.

"You—what did you just say?" Gabriel was so overwhelmed he nearly collapsed. Immediately, he shot Vivienne a furious glare.

Vivienne was just as stunned.

Isabelle, however, blinked innocently. "Don’t blame me. When the police ask questions, we have to cooperate. Honestly, if you didn’t want people to know, you shouldn’t have done it. Besides… rumors do spread in our industry."

This was also a subtle way of clarifying that Vivienne hadn’t been the one to expose his gambling habit—ensuring Gabriel couldn’t retaliate against her later if he was acquitted.

"I didn’t!" Gabriel couldn’t even lift his head anymore. He could feel his mother’s burning gaze boring into him.

"He gambles. I can confirm that." Vivienne suddenly spoke up.

With everyone rallying behind her, Vivienne couldn't possibly let them down now.

.

Gabriel stared at Vivienne in disbelief. A girl as dutiful as her should have been the last person to break a promise. Even though they had parted ways, he never imagined Vivienne would expose someone else’s secrets.

Yet, Vivienne watched him, her heart numb with sorrow. After all, they had once been lovers. Sometimes, they were the ones who blinded each other the most—yet at other times, they were the ones who understood each other best.

"He once swindled ten million from me and gambled it all away. That was when we ended things."

She just never expected that some people could sink to such depths for the sake of gambling.

Once that truth settled in, certain coincidences no longer seemed like mere accidents.

The reality of the situation became painfully clear, even without further investigation.

Before anyone could react, Claire lunged at Gabriel, her hand raised to strike. Daniel, quick on his feet, dodged just in time, pretending to intervene while subtly allowing Claire to vent her fury first.

"Was it you? Was it you who did this, you wretched boy? What have you done? How could you commit such a vile act? How could you face Vivienne, let alone me and your father? How could you—?"

"I didn’t do it! I swear—!"

By the time the newly arrived officers led Gabriel away, his face was streaked with blood, his sobs echoing through the room.

"Ms. Monroe, rest assured. Our specialists will handle all the photos and videos. We are committed to protecting your privacy, financial security, and reputation."

Hearing those words, Vivienne’s emotions surged again, and she broke down into unrestrained tears.

She had braced herself for the worst, prepared to fight alone—yet, against all odds, everything had been resolved in the blink of an eye. She had no idea who had come to her aid, but she thanked the heavens for not abandoning her in her darkest hour.

Once the necessary paperwork was completed, Daniel asked, "Ms. Monroe, is there anything else you'd like to address? For instance, reclaiming that ten million?"

Before Vivienne could respond, Claire, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "We will return every penny to her."

Claire turned to Vivienne, her expression heavy with remorse. Vivienne, overwhelmed by the unexpected kindness, felt a pang of guilt—kind-hearted people always felt they owed others more than they deserved.

Claire couldn’t bear it. "Please, don’t blame yourself. We’re the ones who wronged you. You shouldn’t feel guilty—you’re a good girl. It’s my fault for failing to raise my son properly, for letting him hurt you like this."

She didn’t resent Vivienne for not telling her about Gabriel’s gambling and debts. After all, back then, Vivienne had only been Gabriel’s girlfriend—not family, not obligated to help discipline him.

Claire’s voice trembled. "You endured so much alone… and we failed you."

Vivienne’s tears fell harder.

Sometimes, justice came from the most unexpected places.

And sometimes, the people who hurt you the most were the ones who ended up saving you.

Freya—no, Claire Harrison now—had always been a woman of principle. She knew right from wrong with crystal clarity. And the mistake Gabriel had made? It was far beyond anything she could fix.

"You don't need to worry about anything else regarding this case," Claire said firmly, her voice unwavering. "Handle it based on the evidence. I won’t beg for leniency, and I won’t interfere. It’s about time he learned his lesson the hard way." A mother could be tough when necessary, and Claire was no exception.

"Then, Ms. Monroe, will you be able to leave the hospital for the police station tomorrow?" Daniel Wright asked, his tone professional yet probing.

Vivienne hesitated, her gaze flickering. Just as she was about to nod, Isabelle Laurent cut in sharply, "Does this mean the live stream tomorrow is really off the table?"

Looks like Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe are going to lose their minds over this news.

Julian cleared his throat, noticing Daniel’s displeased expression. "That might be asking too much of Vivienne right now."

Vivienne bit her lip, torn, until Claire spoke up again. "I’ll stand by you for this final act. Don’t let that reckless boy ruin your moment. Do you really want to give up this opportunity?"

Something hardened in Vivienne’s eyes. She clenched her fists, then lifted her chin. "No. I will take that stage."

In the end, Daniel agreed to accommodate them, showing unexpected flexibility. When the moment of truth came, Vivienne steeled herself and laid everything bare—including pressing charges against her own mother and uncle.

Daniel glanced at the stunned Adriana and Bartholomeo—no, Victor—on the sidelines, raising an eyebrow. "Busy day for arrests. I’ll need to call in reinforcements." Without another word, he pulled out his phone to summon backup.

Adriana and Victor erupted into furious curses, hurling insults at Vivienne.

She didn’t flinch.

It was Daniel who stepped forward, his voice sharp as steel. "Enough. One more word, and I’ll add threatening the victim to your charges."

They fell silent, shrinking back in disbelief.

When Daniel finally left, the most surprising reaction came from Isabelle—who practically bounced after him.

What’s she up to? Julian frowned. Did she take a liking to him? Or is she trying to recruit him for some project?

At first, he thought Isabelle was flirting. But then he caught snippets of her excited chatter—something about a guest appearance—and realized, with some amusement, that in certain ways, Isabelle and Danielle were cut from the same cloth.

But they were all probably wrong.

Because knowing Isabelle?

She was absolutely trying to rope him into their stage play.
###Chapter 167 The Final Verdict of Justice Keeper

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the same line for the fifth time.

Why can’t I focus?

Her phone buzzed—a message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Lillian: Don’t forget, your meeting with Preston Whitmore is in an hour. He’s expecting your final decision on the script.

Evelyn groaned. She had been avoiding this conversation for days. The role was perfect—a strong, complex female lead in a psychological thriller. But something held her back.

Her thoughts drifted to Nathan Blackwood.

Just the thought of him sent a shiver down her spine. Their last encounter had been… explosive. The way his storm-gray eyes had darkened when she’d challenged him, the way his voice had dropped to that dangerous whisper—

No. Focus.

She grabbed her coat and headed out, determined to push him from her mind.

The studio lot was bustling when she arrived. Preston Whitmore, the acclaimed director, greeted her with a warm smile.

“Evelyn, glad you could make it.” He gestured to the chair across from his desk. “So? Have you decided?”

She hesitated. “It’s a brilliant script, Preston. But I’m not sure it’s the right time for me.”

His brow furrowed. “You’re perfect for this role. What’s holding you back?”

Before she could answer, the door swung open.

Nathan stood there, his broad frame filling the doorway, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

“Sorry to interrupt,” he said smoothly, though his gaze never left hers. “Preston, we need to talk about the reshoots.”

Preston sighed. “Nathan, we’re in the middle of something—”

“It’s fine,” Evelyn cut in, standing abruptly. “We can finish this later.”

Nathan’s lips curved into a smirk as she brushed past him, but his hand shot out, catching her wrist.

“Running away again, Evelyn?” His voice was low, meant only for her.

She yanked her arm free, glaring. “I don’t run from anything.”

His smirk deepened. “Prove it.”

The challenge hung between them, electric.

Preston cleared his throat. “If you two are done?”

Nathan released her, but his gaze burned into her back as she strode out.

Outside, Evelyn exhaled sharply, her pulse racing.

Damn him.

She pulled out her phone and typed a message to Lillian.

Evelyn: Tell Preston I’ll take the role.

If Nathan thought she’d back down, he was wrong.

She was done running.

The paparazzi had been tailing Vivienne Monroe relentlessly since her show's explosive success. So when Gabriel Ramirez was escorted away by police in handcuffs, the internet erupted within minutes.

Yet with no official statements released, wild speculations ran rampant. The most popular theory? A messy love triangle gone wrong.

Claudia Bennett had been ready to call Gabriel the moment she saw those scandalous photos of Vivienne. She wanted to warn him again about that "scheming girl" who couldn't be trusted. But before she could dial, trending notifications flooded her phone.

Her beloved godson had been arrested.

Claudia immediately phoned Claire Harrison. "What in heaven's name happened to Gabriel? Did that wretched Vivienne report him? How dare she hurt my boy like this!"

Claire's voice turned arctic. "Were you aware of Gabriel's gambling addiction?"

A stunned pause. "...What?"

"Then it's none of your concern," Claire snapped. "Let me make this clear—he's my son. I won't tolerate interference in how I discipline him." The line went dead.

Claudia trembled with outrage. She'd loved Gabriel as her own for decades! How could Claire sever their bond? While Gabriel's own mother stood idle as outsiders bullied him, Claudia wouldn't.

Within the hour, she stormed into the police station with Pearson Group's top lawyer, demanding Gabriel's immediate release.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood stayed out of the drama. Back home, they regaled the Blackwoods with today's thrilling events. Though everyone knew the story, hearing it retold sparked fresh outrage.

Margaret shook her head. "A man who gambles is utterly undateable."

Richard nodded grimly. "When life knocks them down, they think the casino will make them kings again. But the house always wins."

Sophia exhaled shakily. "Thank heavens you intervened when you did. Who knows what might've happened?"

Evelyn grinned. "All credit to Julian—he orchestrated this perfectly."

Nathan's innocent blink made everyone stifle laughs. "Don't look at me. This was your masterplan from the start."

Evelyn found herself deeply troubled by the situation. "Mrs. Harrison wasted no time arranging the transfer of the ten million. But as for the money swindled by her mother and uncle... that's another story."

A collective sigh filled the room.

Meanwhile, online discussions had exploded into chaos.

Netizens were on edge, speculating whether the show could possibly air the next day. After all, Vivienne was still hospitalized, her condition uncertain, and the son of another key figure in the group had been arrested.

Given the circumstances, most assumed Vivienne had been the one to call the authorities. So, could she and Claire possibly maintain a cordial relationship now?

The general consensus was clear—tomorrow’s show was undoubtedly canceled.

But then, something unexpected happened.

Vivienne took to Twitter, posting a heartfelt message expressing regret for letting personal matters cloud her judgment. She reassured everyone that she was stable and recovering, promising to fulfill her commitment to the show.

The official show account quickly reposted her statement, confirming that everything would proceed as scheduled.

The internet reeled. The show was still on? And Claire was willing to share the stage?

To everyone’s shock, Claire promptly retweeted the post, affirming her dedication to their collaboration.

Netizens were baffled. Were these actresses just that professional? Bound by an unbreakable contract? Or was there more to the story than the rumors suggested?

Frenzied questions flooded social media—why had Vivienne attempted suicide? What was the real reason behind Gabriel’s arrest? But after the key players made their statements, they fell silent, refusing to elaborate further. The lack of answers only fueled the public’s desperation.

In a last-ditch effort for the truth, they turned to Evelyn’s Twitter, bombarding her with pleas.

Netizen: Evelyn, you know what really happened, don’t you?

Netizen: You’re the Justice Guardian. Did someone get exposed because of you?

Netizen: Evelyn, you’re always the first with the juiciest tea. Don’t leave us hanging—spill it!

Netizen: If you don’t tell me now, I won’t sleep tonight. I’m literally on my knees begging.

Netizen: Evelyn, Evelyn, just DM me! I swear I won’t tell a soul!

Netizen: Knowing Justice Guardian’s style, she’s definitely saving the big reveal for the live broadcast. Just wait and watch!

Netizen: You’re absolutely right.

The anticipation was unbearable.

And Evelyn? She remained silent, letting the suspense build.

After all, the best revelations were always saved for the grand finale.

The hashtag #JusticeBringerFinalVerdict skyrocketed to the top of trending searches.

Evelyn Sinclair was completely blindsided.

Who in the world had come up with such an absurd expectation?

Evelyn immediately contacted Isabelle Laurent, demanding the trending topic be taken down.

Isabelle, however, argued that organic positive attention was nothing to worry about.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood family, who had been enjoying the spectacle, struggled to suppress their laughter. But this time, the online spectators were bound to be disappointed—the drama had truly reached its conclusion, with all involved parties already taken away. Even if leaks surfaced later, they had nothing to do with the stage play.

Those in the entertainment industry with skeletons in their closets trembled in fear. Tonight, they found sleep even more elusive than the restless netizens. The mere thought of Evelyn stirring up another scandal—dragging countless others down with her unpredictable tactics—sent chills down their spines.

Cleaning up the entertainment industry was no joke. Thanks to Evelyn’s recent crusade, the industry’s atmosphere had improved drastically. Even those with questionable morals were now on their best behavior, terrified of being exposed and having their careers destroyed.

It almost felt like Evelyn held a sentencing list in her hands. The identity of her next target remained a mystery, sending waves of panic through the ranks of the industry’s most notorious figures.

Meanwhile, various individuals had been pulling strings to gather information, many of them reaching out to the Blackwoods—leaving the family torn between amusement and exasperation.

Even at the filming location, online betting pools were still active. Eventually, the director and producer discreetly approached for answers.

"Honestly, we’ve made peace with it," the producer said earnestly. "But we need a heads-up to manage public opinion in time."

Isabelle couldn’t help but laugh. "This really has nothing to do with us. We just visited a patient. And didn’t you receive the script? We’re sticking to it, I promise."

Not far away, Claire Harrison was in the middle of her makeup session when her phone rang. Her expression darkened instantly. She tapped Vivienne Monroe on the shoulder, then turned and left with her.

The director and producer exchanged nervous glances but couldn’t step away to investigate. All they could do was wait.

Genevieve Blackwood, who had been distractedly keeping Julian and Evelyn company during their makeup sessions, suddenly gasped.

Evelyn glanced up. "What happened?"

Genevieve rushed over, phone in hand. "Daniel just texted—Gabriel Ramirez has been bailed out."

Evelyn’s face paled. She immediately checked the system.


The courtroom buzzed with tension as Gabriel Ramirez stood before the judge, his expression a carefully crafted mask of remorse. His lawyer had spun a tale so audacious it made Evelyn Sinclair's blood boil.

"Your Honor, my client's actions were driven solely by his desire to reconcile with Vivienne Monroe," the defense attorney declared, voice dripping with false sincerity. "This was never about blackmail or extortion—only love."

A derisive scoff escaped Evelyn's lips before she could stop it. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood's jaw tightened, his knuckles whitening around the armrest.

"Love?" Evelyn muttered under her breath. "That's rich."

The prosecution wasn't having it either.

"Your Honor, the defendant's so-called 'love' involved threatening letters, surveillance, and a demand for five million dollars," the prosecutor countered dryly. "If that's romance, I'd hate to see his breakup strategy."

Laughter rippled through the gallery, but the judge's gavel cut it short.

Gabriel's performance was Oscar-worthy—his eyes glistening, voice cracking as he swore he'd only wanted Vivienne back. Never mind the paper trail proving otherwise. Never mind the terrified look on Vivienne's face when she'd testified earlier.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. She'd seen men like Gabriel before—charming, manipulative, convinced their desires justified any means.

The judge adjusted her glasses, scanning the evidence one final time. The pause stretched, suffocating.

Then—

"Mr. Ramirez, the court finds your version of events... creatively fictional."

A gasp. Gabriel's mask slipped for half a second, revealing the cold calculation beneath.

"Given the overwhelming evidence of coercion and financial demands, I rule this as attempted extortion. Bail is revoked. Sentencing will—"

Gabriel's chair screeched as he shot upright. "You can't do this! Vivienne knows I—"

"Silence!" The gavel cracked like a gunshot. "One more outburst and I'll add contempt to your charges."

As marshals hauled him away, Gabriel locked eyes with Evelyn. His whisper carried just far enough:

"This isn't over."

Nathan immediately stepped between them, his glare promising violence if Gabriel so much as blinked wrong. But Evelyn barely noticed—her focus was on Vivienne, trembling in the front row.

Because the real question wasn't whether Gabriel would face consequences.

It was whether his final threat was desperation...

Or a promise.
###Chapter 168 No Other Way

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup, lost in thought. The city below bustled with life, but her mind was elsewhere—on Nathan Blackwood.

A sharp knock at the door snapped her out of her reverie.

"Come in," she called, turning just as Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped inside.

"You have a meeting with Preston Whitmore in thirty minutes," Lillian reminded her, holding out a tablet with the day’s schedule. "And Donovan Sharpe called—he wants to discuss the final edits for the script."

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. "Reschedule the meeting with Donovan. I need to talk to Nathan first."

Lillian hesitated. "Are you sure that’s wise? After what happened last time—"

"I know," Evelyn cut in, her voice firm. "But this can’t wait."

Nathan Blackwood was in his office, staring at the contract in front of him when his phone buzzed. Evelyn’s name flashed on the screen. His jaw tightened.

He considered ignoring it, but something—perhaps the memory of her pleading eyes the last time they spoke—made him answer.

"What is it, Evelyn?" His tone was colder than he intended.

"I need to see you," she said, her voice steady but laced with urgency. "It’s about Sophia."

Nathan’s grip on the phone tightened. His sister’s name was a trigger, a reminder of the tangled web of secrets and betrayals that had torn their family apart.

"Where?" he demanded.

"The café near your office. In twenty minutes."

He exhaled sharply. "Fine."

The café was quiet, the hum of soft jazz blending with the occasional clink of cutlery. Evelyn sat at a corner table, her fingers drumming restlessly against the polished wood. When Nathan walked in, his presence commanded the room—broad shoulders, piercing gaze, and an aura of barely restrained intensity.

He slid into the seat opposite her, his expression unreadable. "Talk."

Evelyn leaned forward, lowering her voice. "Sophia’s in trouble. Daniel Prescott is planning to take Liam away from her."

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "What?"

"She found out about Adriana," Evelyn continued. "She confronted Daniel, and now he’s threatening full custody."

A muscle in Nathan’s jaw twitched. "That bastard."

Evelyn reached across the table, her fingers brushing his wrist. "We have to help her."

Nathan pulled his hand back, his gaze flickering with something unspoken. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because," she said softly, "despite everything, I still care about your family."

The air between them crackled with tension—old wounds, unspoken regrets, and the undeniable pull that neither of them could escape.

Nathan exhaled sharply, pushing back his chair. "I’ll handle it."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn called after him, "Nathan—"

He paused but didn’t look back.

"Be careful," she whispered.

His shoulders tensed, and then he was gone, leaving Evelyn with the weight of what she’d just set into motion.

Meanwhile, across town, Victoria Hayes smirked as she scrolled through the latest tabloid headlines—another scandal involving the Blackwood family.

"Perfect," she murmured, tapping her manicured nails against her phone.

The game was far from over.

Evelyn Sinclair uncovered the truth—this entire mess had been masterfully orchestrated by Claudia Bennett’s lawyer, who had coached Gabriel Ramirez on exactly what to say. They had twisted the narrative, reducing a serious crime into nothing more than a petty lovers' quarrel.

In most cases involving former romantic partners, the approach mirrored domestic violence protocols—focused more on mediation and education than punishment. The only reason this case had gained traction was because of Vivienne Monroe’s suicide attempt.

Gabriel insisted he had no idea Vivienne would break under the pressure. How could he be blamed? It was her own family who had swindled her dry, leaving her with no escape.

The most damning detail? After being blackmailed, Vivienne hadn’t actually transferred any money. Worse, there was no concrete evidence linking Gabriel to gambling debts—just provocative photos and threatening messages, all sent by him. If he stuck to his story—claiming this was just a desperate attempt to win back his ex—then legally, it was hard to pin anything substantial on him.

Thanks to Claudia’s influence, Gabriel walked free.

The only consolation was that the police had scrubbed every trace of Vivienne’s private photos and videos from Gabriel’s devices. No backups, no cloud storage—nothing remained. At least Vivienne wouldn’t have to worry about those haunting her any longer.

But the fight wasn’t over. Vivienne would need a lawyer to pursue further legal action. The case was still open—just framed differently now.

Daniel Wright hadn’t given up, though. Behind the scenes, he was still digging into Gabriel’s gambling debts. The fact that the debts existed but left no paper trail suggested underground dealings. If Daniel could expose that, it would be a major win.

For now, he advised Evelyn and Nathan to inform Vivienne after the performance. They needed to handle this carefully.

When Genevieve Blackwood summarized the situation, Evelyn and Julian exchanged grim looks.

Claudia Bennett is a fool. Worse, she had the nerve to call Mrs. Harrison, arguing that Gabriel had only "lost his way" because of Vivienne. She insisted Vivienne shouldn’t have involved the police—that she had overreacted and traumatized her precious godson.

She still refused to believe Gabriel had a gambling problem. Her blind loyalty was staggering.

Julian and Genevieve remembered the first time Claudia had visited their home. Even then, her favoritism had been obvious. No wonder Gabriel turned out like this—with a godmother who excused every mistake, he knew he’d always have someone shielding him.

Wouldn’t it have been better if Claudia had just let him face the consequences?

But no. She’d rather enable him than admit the truth.

And now, Vivienne was paying the price.

Secrecy? How would he ever repay the debt?

Julian and Genevieve exchanged puzzled glances at the revelation.

Oh, I see. Because he’s under police scrutiny, he can’t demand a large sum of money. He’s trapped. Hah. I can’t help but wonder—what would happen if debt collectors showed up at his door?

Suddenly, Evelyn realized that Gabriel not being arrested might not be such a good thing after all. Who knew what those shadowy figures pulling the strings would force him to do?

Meanwhile, Claire had just ended the call with Claudia’s relentless nagging. Claudia had berated her, accusing her of trusting a stranger over her own godson. She claimed Claire had failed to help Gabriel out of his mess and had even sided with the "culprit." She’d even threatened to confront Vivienne in person later.

Claire couldn’t be bothered with Claudia’s tantrums. She was just… disappointed. She had hoped that by now, her son would have acknowledged his mistakes and faced the consequences honestly. But instead, he had lied to the authorities.

Claire relayed the outcome to Vivienne, her voice firm. "Don’t worry. I won’t let them harass you. As for the case, pursue it to the end. He needs to understand he can’t just walk away from this unscathed."

Vivienne hesitated, unable to meet Claire’s gaze. "Mrs. Harrison…"

"If possible, I want the details of this matter made public. He needs to learn that actions have consequences—that he can’t keep hurting people and expect no repercussions. And don’t worry. I’ll stand with you."

Vivienne was stunned into silence. She had ignored the online speculation, knowing silence wasn’t ideal for her as the victim. She could have exposed everything, painting herself as the wronged party. She had considered it—striking back at Gabriel for everything he’d done.

After all, no more compromising photos or videos would surface now.

But doing so would utterly destroy Gabriel. It wasn’t that she pitied him—it was Claire, who had always protected her, that made her hesitate.

As if sensing her conflict, Claire said bluntly, "Don’t overthink it. These issues will come to light eventually. You might not realize it, but his godmother could go to extreme lengths to attack you. Instead of waiting for the storm to hit, it’s better to face it head-on."

Having spent decades in the entertainment industry, Claire knew every dirty trick in the book. She wouldn’t let Claudia and Gabriel continue wreaking havoc. It was time to take control—to knock him down and rebuild him from scratch.

Claire understood the harsh truth: No destruction, no rebirth. If she didn’t act decisively now, Gabriel might spiral into worse mistakes. And by then, it might be too late to pull him back.

"Alright," Vivienne finally said, resolve hardening. "I’ll sign the contract with Isabelle. I’ll ask her about the specifics later." Seeing Claire’s unwavering determination, Vivienne steeled herself. In a way, this was her final act of mercy—her last attempt to steer Gabriel back onto the right path.


Claire forced a smile, but the exhaustion in her eyes was unmistakable. Yet within seconds, she had slipped back into the role of the stern mother.

She delivered her final ultimatum to Gabriel: No matter how deep in debt you are, I’ll help you settle it this time. But on one condition—you take responsibility for your mistakes and stop running. As long as you acknowledge and correct them, it’s never too late to change.

Vivienne studied Claire, a bittersweet thought crossing her mind—if they were mother and daughter, their story might have had a fairytale ending, like something out of a Broadway play. It would have been proof that a single mother could build a loving home and raise a child with strong values.

But fate had paired them all wrong.

Gabriel, who had just received the message, sat stiffly in Claudia’s car.

His fingers hovered over his phone, hesitation gnawing at him, when suddenly, an anonymous message flashed on the screen. His breath hitched, his body going rigid as his eyes widened in shock.

Claudia’s voice cut through the silence. "Gabriel, don’t be afraid. I’m here to fight for you. Your mother has gone too far. You did nothing wrong. And even if you did—so what? You’re her flesh and blood. She should stand by you unconditionally. But instead, she humiliated you—letting you get arrested, letting the whole world know. How could she watch you suffer like this? Maybe it’s time to cut ties. Stay with me from now on. I’ll take care of you, protect you. And when the time comes, I’ll make sure your father answers for choosing such a cold, heartless woman."

"Aunt Claudia, can we stop at the gas station?" Gabriel blurted.

"Hmm? What’s wrong?"

"I… I need to use the restroom."

As soon as the words left his mouth, he quickly typed out a reply to Claire: Mom, you’ve got it all wrong. Gambling debts? That’s ridiculous. Both you and Vivienne misunderstood me. She misread me last time too. I only threatened her because I wanted her back—I just went about it the wrong way. I’ll explain everything later.

###Chapter 169 Act It Out

The tension in the penthouse was so thick Evelyn Sinclair could almost taste it. Nathan Blackwood stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders rigid with barely contained fury. The city lights flickered behind him, casting long shadows across the polished marble floor.

"You knew," he said, his voice dangerously low. "And you didn’t tell me."

Evelyn swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the edge of the velvet sofa. "I didn’t think it was relevant."

Nathan turned sharply, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Not relevant? Victoria Hayes has been leaking confidential company documents for months, and you didn’t think I needed to know?"

A sharp knock at the door interrupted them. Serena Whitmore stepped in, her usually composed expression strained. "We have a problem," she announced, holding up a tablet. "The press just got wind of the scandal. It’s everywhere."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. This was worse than she’d imagined.

Nathan snatched the tablet, scanning the headlines with a scowl. "Who tipped them off?"

Serena hesitated. "Anonymous source. But the details are too precise—it had to be someone on the inside."

Evelyn’s mind raced. Victoria had always been ruthless, but this? Sabotaging the company just to get back at her? It was unthinkable.

Nathan tossed the tablet onto the coffee table with a clatter. "Damage control. Now." He turned to Evelyn, his expression unreadable. "You’re coming with me."

"Where?"

"To face the wolves."

As they strode toward the elevator, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number lit up her screen:

You should’ve stayed out of this, Evelyn. Now you’ll both pay.

Her breath hitched. This wasn’t just about business anymore.

The sleek black sedan rolled to a stop outside a bustling supermarket, its tinted windows reflecting the afternoon sun.

Gabriel Ramirez stepped into the restroom, his hands trembling slightly as he checked his phone. The anonymous message had come through just minutes ago. With a deep breath, he dialed the number provided.

A cold, calculated voice answered. "This is your only chance. Follow our instructions exactly, and your fifty-million-dollar debt disappears by tonight. No one will ever trace it back to you. We don’t make promises we can’t keep."

Gabriel swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. Determination flickered in his dark eyes.

If this debt vanished, no one could accuse him of using Vivienne Monroe to settle his gambling debts. He could spin it as a desperate attempt to win her back—a foolish, lovestruck mistake, nothing more.

Better to be seen as reckless than a fraud.

His mother, Claire Harrison, would never have to know. His friends wouldn’t look at him with pity or disgust.

He’d never touch another card again.

When Vivienne received the message, her heart sank. This only confirmed her decision—she had to go public.

Meanwhile, Isabelle Laurent was deep in conversation with the film’s director, Preston Whitmore, and producer, Donovan Sharpe. The premiere countdown had begun, and the industry was buzzing. Every major player was watching, waiting for a misstep.

After triple-checking the arrangements, Donovan finally exhaled. "Everything’s set."

Just as they turned to leave, Isabelle cleared her throat. "One more thing. We need to replace an actor."

Preston and Donovan spun around, their expressions a mix of resignation and—oddly—excitement.

"Go ahead," Preston said, grinning. "We can handle it."

Isabelle arched a brow. Had Evelyn Sinclair’s reputation really made them this jaded?

The two men stared at her with an almost challenging glint in their eyes, as if daring her to drop another bombshell.

What else do you have up your sleeve? their gazes seemed to ask.

Isabelle suppressed a smirk.

This was going to be interesting.

The director and producer's excitement deflated instantly.

The stage play's theme was "Home." Evelyn Sinclair and Julian Blackwood would portray an epic love story from a national perspective—a tale of sacrifice where a mother sends her only son to war, only for him to perish in battle. The underlying message? That a nation's strength is what makes a home possible.

The animal actor in the play was a military dog. The son brings home a puppy for his mother to meet, but in the end, only the wounded war dog returns, staying faithfully by her side.

Two animal actors were needed—one for the puppy, which was easy to cast, and another for the adult dog, which required a more nuanced performance.

Initially, they had hired a regular, well-trained canine actor—obedient and cooperative. But Isabelle Laurent, the manager, wasn’t satisfied. The dog’s expressions and posture lacked the raw emotion needed to truly move the audience.

Isabelle had bigger ambitions. The play’s patriotic theme was profound, and she wanted it to resonate deeply—maybe even catch the attention of government officials. While that wasn’t her primary goal, the potential for recognition was too good to ignore.

She envisioned a retired military dog in the role—something that would spark public discussion. Unfortunately, military dogs were highly valued assets and couldn’t be loaned out for performances.

Then, she ran into Daniel Wright.

While a military dog was off the table, a police dog? That was doable.

With some persuasion—emphasizing the artistic integrity and potential positive PR—Daniel agreed to help. Whether it was out of respect for Nathan Blackwood or the promise of good publicity, he secured them a recently retired K-9 unit dog.

The police dog’s role was simple: follow commands and react naturally. The real magic was in its presence—the way it carried itself, the weight of its service evident in every movement.

It didn’t need rehearsals. As long as its handler was present, it could adapt seamlessly.

Evelyn and Julian had already perfected their scenes together, flawlessly in sync. They just hadn’t informed the director and producer yet.

Animals, like humans, could keep secrets. But Isabelle still mentioned—casually—that she had secured a real retired police dog with a decorated service record.

The director and producer, recognizing the promotional goldmine, didn’t question it. They simply nodded and left.

Once Evelyn and Julian  makeup, they headed to the lounge. The police dog and its handler were already there.

It wasn’t every day they encountered a K-9 unit dog—especially one so imposing. Yet—


When off duty, the dog was unexpectedly affectionate. The trio was completely smitten, snatching every chance they could to play with it.

Just then, they spotted Vivienne approaching Isabelle. Unable to resist the juicy drama, they lingered nearby, eager for gossip.

After hearing their thoughts, Isabelle agreed—but not without a warning. "This approach might stir controversy. Whether it's the unresolved gambling debts, emotional debts, or the incident of reporting Gabriel to the police…"

If one person directly accused another, no matter the truth, there would always be sharp minds spinning conspiracy theories or wielding moral pressure.

Eavesdropping, Genevieve suddenly spoke up. "Why not act it out?"

All eyes turned to her.

Genevieve fidgeted, scratching her ear sheepishly. "Isn't that what we usually do? Your group's performance already involves a daughter seeking her mother's help when in trouble. Couldn't we swap the trouble with this issue?"

Isabelle's eyes lit up. Exactly. Their performances had always been a tool—when evidence was scarce, they used drama to provoke thought and encourage the audience to uncover the truth. This situation was no different.

Staging it on their unique platform would carry more weight than a blunt accusation. Though not performed by Justice Upholder, Vivienne would soon join their studio, subtly tempering Evelyn’s exaggerated persona.

Isabelle loved the idea but hesitated. "But changing plans last minute…"

Rebecca, freshly made-up, strolled over with a smile. "Vivienne can handle it."

They’d studied each other’s strengths meticulously.

Truthfully, Vivienne preferred acting over blunt confrontation.

Her gaze flicked toward Claire, standing nearby.

They knew the full truth—like having the entire script. Vivienne was a natural, and Claire was an award-winning actress. A minor script tweak wouldn’t faze them.

Claire nodded. "Let’s refine the changes. The performance could serve as a lesson—teaching girls how to handle these situations right."

Her serious tone dissolved when Vivienne ducked her head, embarrassed.

The group burst into laughter.

As the live stream began, comments flooded in—speculations swirling in the chaos.

The moment Vivienne Monroe and Claire Harrison stepped onto the stage, the internet erupted. Their flawless performance, combined with the shocking revelation of a carefully orchestrated scam, sent social media into a frenzy.

Vivienne, radiant under the spotlight, delivered her lines with such raw emotion that the audience held their breath. Claire, playing her counterpart, matched her intensity with a chilling precision that left no doubt—this was no ordinary performance.

As the scene unfolded, the truth behind the scam was laid bare. The audience gasped, whispers spreading like wildfire. Within minutes, hashtags related to their performance were trending worldwide.

"Did you see that?" one viewer tweeted. "Vivienne and Claire just exposed everything. This isn’t acting—it’s real."

Backstage, Gabriel Ramirez watched the live feed, his expression unreadable. His mother, Claire, had warned him this moment would come, but even he hadn’t anticipated the sheer magnitude of the reaction.

Meanwhile, Claudia Bennett, gripping her phone tightly, scrolled through the flood of comments. Her lips curled into a smirk. "Let’s see how they spin this," she murmured.

The performance ended with a dramatic crescendo, leaving the audience in stunned silence before erupting into thunderous applause. The cameras panned to Vivienne’s face—her eyes glistening with unshed tears, her lips trembling ever so slightly.

And just like that, the world was hooked.

By the time the credits rolled, theories were already circulating. Was this part of the script? Or had Vivienne and Claire just broken the fourth wall in the most spectacular way possible?

One thing was certain—no one would forget this night.

The internet, as always, would demand answers. And Vivienne Monroe was more than ready to give them.

###Chapter 170: The Mark of Truth

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathan Blackwood had already left for his early meeting, leaving only the faint scent of his cologne lingering in the air.

She stretched, her mind drifting to last night—Nathan’s whispered promises, the way his hands had traced her skin with possessive reverence. A shiver ran down her spine.

Her phone buzzed.

Lillian Graves: "Emergency meeting at the studio. Preston and Donovan are furious."

Evelyn frowned. Furious? That didn’t bode well.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek black pantsuit—armor for whatever storm awaited her. As she stepped into the elevator, her reflection stared back: determined, unyielding.

The studio was chaos.

Preston Whitmore paced like a caged tiger, while Donovan Sharpe scowled at his tablet. The moment Evelyn entered, all eyes snapped to her.

Preston: "You’ve seen the headlines?"

She hadn’t.

Donovan shoved the tablet toward her. The screen blared:

"Evelyn Sinclair’s Dark Secret: Stolen Scripts & Betrayal?"

Her stomach dropped.

Evelyn: "This is ridiculous. Who planted this?"

Donovan: "Does it matter? The press is rabid. Investors are pulling out."

A cold laugh escaped her. "So you believe them over me?"

Preston’s jaw tightened. "We need damage control. Now."

Before she could retort, the door burst open.

Nathan stood there, his expression thunderous. "We’re done playing nice."

Silence.

Then—

Victoria Hayes slithered into view, a smirk curling her lips. "Oh, this is getting interesting."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

Nathan’s gaze locked onto Victoria. "You have three seconds to explain why your name is all over this smear campaign."

Victoria paled. "I—"

Nathan: "Two."

The room held its breath.

Nathan: "One."

Victoria bolted.

Nathan didn’t chase her. Instead, he turned to Evelyn, his voice a vow. "No one ruins you. No one."

And just like that—the game changed.

Beneath the stage, the Blackwood family sat in stunned silence, their expressions a mix of shock and disbelief.

"Did they just... reenact the actual events?" Richard murmured, his voice barely above a whisper.

"But didn't Daniel mention that..." Margaret trailed off, her worried gaze flickering toward the man beside her clutching a bouquet of roses.

Nathan, too, had made an appearance tonight. After all, this was Evelyn Sinclair’s final performance.

Nathan’s lips curved into a faint, approving smile. "Actually, it's a brilliant move. Even if the other side denies it, they can’t accuse the play of slander. Clever."

Richard and Margaret exhaled in relief.

Sophia, however, gasped. "So they improvised this whole scene? Just like Ms. Monroe always does—spontaneous and raw. No wonder they cast Vivienne. Her acting is flawless. You’d never guess it wasn’t scripted."

The rest of the Blackwoods nodded in agreement.

But the audience around them had already erupted into hushed whispers.

The scandal involving Vivienne’s suicide attempt and Gabriel’s arrest had been headline news. Strip away the complexities, and the stage performance mirrored reality almost too perfectly.

Online, chaos ensued. Netizens had barely processed the breaking news of Gabriel’s release before Claudia’s legal team had spun a narrative painting Gabriel as a lovesick fool who’d made mistakes. The media frenzy had already begun.

Now, this play flipped everything on its head.

Comments flooded social media.

Netizen1: What the hell? Gabriel just got released! If this play is accurate, he’s a straight-up criminal. He shouldn’t be free!

Netizen2: Am I the only one who finds this surreal? Why would Mrs. Harrison collaborate with Vivienne on this? Whose side is she even on?

Netizen3: Justice over blood. His own mother has spoken. The truth is clear.

Netizen4: No way. Gabriel is innocent—his release proves it. I’ll always stand by him. Vivienne’s the problem! Those leaked photos don’t lie.

Netizen5: Are you blind? Those were clearly taken without consent.

Netizen6: Exactly. This scene? Textbook violation. Boyfriend snaps pics of his sleeping girlfriend. Disgusting.

The murmurs grew louder, the theater buzzing with tension. Onstage, the actors held their positions, the weight of their performance settling over the crowd like a storm.

And in the shadows, unseen, a single figure clenched their fists.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

The online chatter exploded like wildfire.

Netizen1: Come on, taking intimate photos is just a couple's private thing, right? This whole drama feels staged. Rumor has it the "threat" was just a ploy to lure Vivienne back. And the financial scam accusation? Total nonsense. Gabriel's family is loaded! Besides, isn't this level of obsession kind of... darkly romantic?

Netizen2: What kind of toxic novels have you been reading? Name them so I can avoid that trash. If this happened in real life, the police would be involved, period.

Netizen3: Regardless of the aftermath, the fact remains—he took those photos without consent. Men like him are revolting!

Netizen4: I’ve been through this too, and I was naive. When I confronted him, he looked at me with those puppy-dog eyes, claiming it was "because he loved me too much." He wanted to "preserve our memories" for when we grew old. I didn’t make him delete them. Guess what? After we broke up, those photos ended up on shady forums. His "love" turned into locker-room bragging rights.

Netizen5: Vivienne might’ve been oblivious, but you? You should’ve known better. Thinking you’re so special that he’d never cross the line? That’s not love—that’s delusion. When a man loves you, it’s real. When he stops, the cruelty is just as real.

Netizen6: Even if this leaks, who can prove it’s real? Deepfake tech is insane these days. Demand concrete evidence or stay quiet.

Netizen7: We’re born with nothing. Everything else is temporary. Life’s too short to obsess over others’ opinions. Live for yourself.

Netizen8: Preach! But ladies, always protect yourselves. No matter how perfect he seems, no matter how his charm melts your heart—stay guarded. Real love doesn’t put you at risk. If he does, his priorities are clear: you’re expendable.

Netizen9: As a guy, I’d never risk taking private photos. Lose my phone? Get hacked? The internet’s a minefield. Any man who does this is unhinged.

Netizen10: Gabriel’s forced proposal always gave me bad vibes.

Netizen11: Wait—what if the proposal was a last-ditch effort to pay off gambling debts? The threats only started after she refused?

Netizen12: Or maybe he proposed out of love, then threatened out of spite. Both scenarios fit, no?

Netizen13: So… this whole exposé is fabricated?

Netizen14: I’m not saying that. Maybe the truth just unfolded this way. This isn’t Evelyn Sinclair’s scripted drama. I’ll reserve judgment.

The revelations about the blackmail and gambling were so abrupt they barely registered as the main talking point. Isabelle Laurent and her team hadn’t anticipated this twist, but the truth was out—mission accomplished.

Backstage, Isabelle Laurent clicked her tongue in amusement before turning to Evelyn Sinclair. "Your word has become gospel truth. You're like a human authenticity stamp now. If you hadn't exposed that scandal, nobody would've questioned a thing."

Evelyn's lips twitched. Would people actually believe me if I praised their performance during the post-show interview? The mere thought made her shoulders tense with pressure.

Julian and Genevieve barely suppressed their laughter. They couldn't deny the observation - it was as if Evelyn's judgment carried the weight of a divine decree.

Meanwhile, Seraphina Delacroix and Claire Harrison's performance was reaching its crescendo. The trainer led the retired police dog, Sven, backstage where Evelyn's group waited. Both Evelyn and Julian greeted the enthusiastic canine, who responded with vigorous tail wagging.

"Thank you in advance," Evelyn murmured, scratching behind Sven's ears.

"Don't be nervous," Julian said solemnly.

The trainer chuckled. "No need to worry. Sven's seen everything. He's practically vibrating with excitement - hasn't had a proper mission since retirement and misses the action terribly."

Sven puffed out his chest proudly, his entire body thrumming with anticipation.

As applause erupted from the audience, their cue arrived.

Elsewhere, Claudia Bennett had just driven Gabriel Ramirez to the broadcast studio when her lawyer called. After watching the live broadcast replay, her vision tinted red with fury.

"How could your mother do this to you? She's systematically destroying your reputation! Doesn't she trust you at all? We need to confront her immediately!"

Gabriel stared at the trending topics with a stony expression. Every effort he'd made to salvage his image was being systematically dismantled.

The lawyer noted they were fortunate this was merely a performance. Netizens remained cautiously observant rather than outright condemning. They needed to seize this opportunity to clarify during the live broadcast before things escalated beyond repair.

Claudia agreed wholeheartedly. Since Vivienne Monroe had shown such ruthless disregard, she'd make sure the world knew about the woman's thieving ways. Her fingers absently traced the pearl necklace at her throat - a silent reminder of past betrayals.

Vivienne sought to ruin Gabriel while playing the victim and climbing the social ladder. Claudia would never allow her godson to be trampled for someone else's ambition.

"Gabriel, stop dawdling!" Claudia snapped when he didn't immediately exit the car.

Gabriel hesitated, suddenly hyperaware of the surveillance cameras surrounding them. The thought of sitting alone in the vehicle under their unblinking gaze made his skin crawl. With no alternative, he followed Claudia toward the studio.

By the time they arrived, Evelyn and Julian's performance was already at its midpoint, the audience completely enthralled.

###Chapter 171 No Reason To Feel Guilty
Eavesdropping on Juicy Secrets in Her Head

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind already buzzing with the latest gossip she’d overheard—not from whispered conversations, but from the unfiltered thoughts of those around her.

Ever since she’d discovered her uncanny ability to read minds, life had become infinitely more entertaining. And today? Oh, today was going to be delicious.

As she sipped her coffee, Evelyn tuned into the mental chatter of her assistant, Lillian Graves.

"Ugh, I can’t believe Nathan Blackwood canceled another meeting. Does he think his schedule is more important than Evelyn’s?"

Evelyn smirked. Nathan, her infuriatingly handsome business rival, was always playing hard to get. But she had a feeling his aloofness was just a front.

Then, like a gift from the gossip gods, another thought floated into her awareness—this time from Serena Whitmore, her ever-dramatic agent.

"If I have to deal with one more diva demand from Seraphina Delacroix, I swear I’ll quit. Who does she think she is, demanding a private jet for a two-hour shoot?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Seraphina, the notoriously high-maintenance actress, was at it again. She made a mental note to casually bring this up at lunch—just to watch Serena’s face turn scarlet.

But the real gem came when she tuned into the thoughts of Marcus Donovan, her brother Julian’s slick-talking agent.

"If Julian finds out about the secret clause in his contract, he’ll lose it. Better keep this under wraps until after the deal closes."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Now this was the kind of juicy intel she lived for.

She leaned back, savoring the chaos unfolding in her mind. Oh yes, today was going to be very interesting.

And the best part? No one had any idea she knew their secrets.

Yet.

The stage play performed by Team A-list was profoundly moving, marking the first time Evelyn Sinclair had fully immersed herself in a role.

Her acting, though still rough around the edges, carried an undeniable sincerity that captivated the audience.

With Julian Blackwood and Rebecca completely embodying their characters, the production was guaranteed to be extraordinary.

Yet, as the audience watched, many couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

Netizen: I must be addicted to drama. If Team A-list doesn’t stir up some chaos, it just doesn’t feel right.

Netizen: A stage without a little scandal is like a cake without frosting—bland.

Netizen: After seeing the last group’s performance, I expected some kind of reaction from them.

Netizen: Remember in Season 1 when Team Young Again tried to drop hints in their act, only for Team A-list to shut them down with theirs? This time, since there was no rebuttal, maybe it means Vivienne Monroe’s version of events was true. In a way, that’s its own kind of acknowledgment.

Netizen: Hard to say…

Netizen: So, the "Justice Upholder" isn’t cleaning house this season?

Netizen: The entertainment industry’s already been through the wringer. How much more can Evelyn possibly expose?

Netizen: Exactly. She’s already dug up everything there is. She can’t keep making enemies forever.

Netizen: Guess she’s really focusing on acting now. Makes sense—she always wanted to be an actress. At the end of the day, skill matters most.

Netizen: After several seasons, I can honestly say Evelyn’s acting has improved.

Netizen: If we’re just judging by performance, it’s hard to call a winner this round.

Netizen: Who cares about drama? This play is amazing. It’s patriotic, moving—everything you’d want.

Netizen: This shows Team A-list’s sense of responsibility. Knowing their influence is at its peak, they chose a script that inspires the younger generation.

Netizen: Team A-list’s plays always have depth.

Netizen: Watching this makes me want to enlist.

Netizen: Am I the only one completely obsessed with Sven? That has to be a real military dog, right?

Netizen: Looks like it has an injury on its hind leg—probably retired. Hard to say if it was military, though.

The performance ended to thunderous applause, but whispers still lingered. Had Evelyn truly moved on from her crusade? Or was this just another calculated move in a much larger game?

Only time would tell.

Nathan nodded. “Yes, it’s a retired detection dog.”

“It’s a hero!” Richard exclaimed, his voice brimming with excitement.

“Indeed, it’s made remarkable contributions and displayed extraordinary skills.”

Margaret watched in surprise. “It worked so seamlessly with Julian and Evelyn.”

Nathan gestured toward the photography area nearby. “Its trainer is right over there, ready to give commands at any moment.”

The family was deep in conversation when a familiar voice cut through the air.

“Well, well, look who’s all here.” Claudia Bennett had clashed with them before, but time had dulled the memory. Seeing them gathered now, she couldn’t resist approaching—especially since she’d heard it was Julian who had called the police.

For Claudia, fiercely protective of her own, it was like striking a nerve.

When the Blackwood family turned and saw Claudia and Gabriel Ramirez approaching together, they weren’t particularly shocked.

“You had the audacity to get someone arrested and still act like nothing happened. I must say, your family never ceases to amaze me. Clearly, you have no respect for the Pearson family.”

Margaret arched a brow. The moment she spotted the gleaming pearl necklace around Claudia’s neck, she instinctively took a step back—Claudia was standing uncomfortably close.

Her gaze flickered to Gabriel, who stood behind Claudia, his expression shadowed beneath a mask. A flicker of curiosity crossed her face.

“What’s wrong? Finally feeling guilty, are we? He’s my godson, which makes him practically family to you. And yet, look what your son did!” Claudia’s voice trembled with barely restrained fury.

“I doubt you even know half of what your godson has been up to,” Margaret muttered under her breath. “Why are you here? Looking for trouble?”

Claudia scoffed. “I’m here to settle the score!”

She opened her mouth to say more, but Nathan’s voice cut in sharply. “Do not interrupt the performance.”

Claudia still held a trace of fear for Nathan.

The audience seated behind them had already begun murmuring in irritation at the disturbance in the aisle.

Under the weight of so many disapproving stares, Gabriel suddenly grew uneasy. He tugged his baseball cap lower and pulled Claudia toward the nearest empty seats—fortunately, the VIP section still had a few available.

The moment Gabriel sat down, his body stiffened, his face darkening.

Claudia and Gabriel had only gotten in through connections, so they weren’t foolish enough to disrupt the ongoing performance. Their lawyer’s advice echoed in their minds—if they wanted to clear things up, they’d have to wait.

But patience had never been Claudia’s strong suit.

The live interview segment after the performance was the perfect opportunity to expose the truth.

Their lawyer had advised them to communicate with the involved parties before making a public scene, so they had gone to see Claire first.

But Claire had ignored their calls entirely. Worse, she was backstage with Vivienne.

Claudia had no intention of facing Vivienne directly—not yet. She wanted to catch her off guard, to humiliate her in front of everyone. So instead of storming backstage, she took a seat in the audience, biding her time for the final interview.

Yet when she spotted the Blackwoods, she couldn’t resist confronting them.

Once Claudia finally settled, she didn’t escalate things further.

The Blackwoods had been on edge, fearing retaliation after Julian and Evelyn had reported the incident. But when Claudia remained quiet, they relaxed—just a little.

Sophia quickly messaged Genevieve, who was still backstage, filling her in.

Isabelle, who had been deep in contract negotiations with Vivienne, frowned at Genevieve’s message. "What are they planning?"

"She’s coming for us," Claire scoffed. "Mark my words, Claudia’s going to pull something during the live segment."

Claudia had never been the refined heiress people expected. When she wanted something, she took it—no hesitation, no decorum.

"She’s definitely targeting Vivienne, and my idiot son is probably trying to clear his name. There’s going to be chaos," Claire muttered, her expression dark. "This won’t end quietly."

Vivienne’s face paled. Regret twisted inside her. How did I ever get involved with someone like Gabriel?

Isabelle gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Don’t worry. You’ll be onstage with Evelyn and Julian. I’ve never seen anyone outmaneuver them in a live setting. Just give them a heads-up later."

Truthfully, Isabelle wasn’t entirely confident. Desperate people were unpredictable, especially when one of them was a woman like Claudia.

But she trusted Evelyn. Despite her usual laid-back demeanor, Evelyn had an uncanny ability to take control when it mattered most.

At worst, it would be a stalemate—neither side able to overpower the other. If that happened, they’d rely on Evelyn’s reputation as the Justice Upholder to sway public opinion. After all, they were telling the truth. There was no reason to feel guilty.

Since no consensus could be reached, they decided to play it by ear—handling each problem as it arose.

With that, the group moved to the side of the stage, waiting for the play to end.

###Chapter 172: Sven's Warning

Eavesdropping on Juicy Secrets in Her Head

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still half-asleep, when suddenly—

"Ugh, Nathan Blackwood is such a pain! Who does he think he is, ordering me around like that?"

Evelyn jolted upright, blinking in confusion. That voice—sharp, irritated—was unmistakably Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s secretary. But Victoria wasn’t in the room.

Then it hit her.

She was hearing Victoria’s thoughts.

A slow smirk curled Evelyn’s lips. This was gold.

She focused, tuning in like a radio dial.

"If he thinks I’m going to fetch his coffee one more time, he’s got another thing coming. I didn’t claw my way up the corporate ladder to be a glorified barista."

Evelyn muffled a laugh into her pillow. Oh, this was delicious.

Then another voice cut in—smooth, arrogant, dripping with authority. Nathan.

"Victoria’s been slacking lately. Maybe I should replace her. That new intern seems eager enough."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Oh-ho! Office drama and impending firings? She was living for this.

But before she could dive deeper, her phone buzzed. A text from Lillian Graves, her assistant:

"Emergency meeting in 30. Preston and Donovan are freaking out about the script changes. Bring coffee. Lots of it."

Evelyn groaned. Right. Work.

Still, as she dragged herself out of bed, she couldn’t help but grin. This mind-reading thing? Best. Superpower. Ever.

And she had a front-row seat to all the drama.

The play reached its climax as the audience witnessed Julian Blackwood's character—the fallen soldier—die on the battlefield. At last, Evelyn Sinclair's character returned with the wounded, retired military dog, Sven.

Evelyn gazed at Sven, who lowered his head and let out a soft whimper, as if begging forgiveness for failing to bring her son home safely. Her voice trembled as she stepped forward, gently stroking his fur. "Good boy," she whispered. "Welcome home."

Time passed in a montage of shifting seasons, marked by the soft glow of stage lights and a haunting orchestral score. Evelyn, now aged and frail, slowly made her way to the front of the stage with Sven at her side. Her posture had curved with the years, and she sank onto the ground with effort, leaning against the loyal dog as they both stared into the distance.

Behind them, the massive screen displayed a collage of photographs—smiling faces of military families, proud soldiers in uniform, and finally, the outline of the nation’s borders. The imagery was striking, evoking a profound silence from the audience. Even the livestream viewers were moved to tears.

One comment flashed across the screen: No dramatic twists, yet… it’s breathtaking.

Another followed: Our peace is built on the sacrifices of others.

A third chimed in: I came for entertainment, not an emotional breakdown!

And yet another: These are the real idols—the ones who stand between us and danger.

A particularly poignant remark read: After this, celebrity scandals feel like cheap distractions.

Someone else agreed: Exactly. Pathetic, really.

A fan of Sven revealed: Did you know he’s a real detection dog? His handler retired safely, thank goodness. Otherwise, I’d be sobbing uncontrollably right now.

Another viewer marveled: Who knew a performance without drama could be this powerful? Team A-List, you’ve outdone yourselves.

As the play neared its conclusion, Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe finally released the breaths they’d been holding.

They had been on edge ever since Vivienne Monroe and Claire Harrison made last-minute changes to the script. The fear of a live broadcast exposing their secrets had been paralyzing—like trusting a known troublemaker to behave, only for them to spark chaos anyway. It was an epidemic of unpredictability.

But they were veterans at damage control. Their hearts had raced at first, terrified that Team A-List might derail everything. They had braced for backlash, for controversy, for disaster.

And yet… nothing happened.

It had gone too smoothly.

Which, in their world, was suspicious.

The previous team had used the stage to settle personal vendettas. But Team A-List? They hadn’t seized the opportunity to "reform the industry" or make some grand statement.

It was almost… disappointing.

Or maybe, just maybe, they were playing a longer game.

Preston and Donovan finally mustered the courage to respond to their worried friends' frantic messages.

Though their friends were innocent, their friends' associates might not be.

Tension hung thick in the air after Team A-list's disastrous performance.

A mass notification went out: Aside from Vivienne and Gabriel's situation, tonight was uneventful. Justice Upholder is off duty.

Then, a message from Isabelle Laurent popped up.

Preston and Donovan exchanged uneasy glances, but relief washed over them after reading it.

They knew minor trouble might follow, but given the culprit's fame and connections, they weren't worried. Another trending scandal? Bring it on.

Just as they prepared to reply, the trainer in the filming zone abruptly stepped forward. "Sven?"

Murmurs rippled through the audience.

Preston and Donovan looked up to see Sven—who had been sitting obediently beside Evelyn—suddenly rise, hackles raised. The massive dog snarled, muscles coiled to attack.

Its piercing gaze locked onto the Blackwoods.

A dog of Sven's size acting aggressively was terrifying. Evelyn gasped. "S-Sven!"

The trainer paled, signaling frantically, but Sven remained fixated, clearly zeroing in on a target.

Retired for over two years, Sven's abrupt aggression left the trainer scrambling to react.

The barking intensified, sharp and urgent. Nearby guests shrieked, scrambling back.

Claudia Bennett cursed, "Who brings a wild animal on set? It's a hazard! Your precious daughter-in-law might lose a limb!"

"Shut your vile mouth. That detection dog has more brains than you!" Margaret snapped.

Hearing the commotion, Gabriel shot to his feet, cold sweat drenching him. He ignored the stab of pain from his sudden movement.

The dog was targeting him. They were barely five meters apart.

Gabriel spun to flee—but Sven's barks pursued him.

Gasps erupted as a black blur launched through the air.

Gabriel's foot hit the stairs just as Sven tackled him. A scream tore from his throat when the dog's jaws clamped onto his leg, trapping him.

His hat flew off. Someone yelled, "That's Gabriel Ramirez!"

The studio erupted into chaos.

The cameras instantly zoomed in on the unfolding drama, and the live chat erupted into chaos.

One viewer typed: What just happened? Gabriel’s here and got bitten?!

Another replied: Guess the dog knows who’s shady?

A third chimed in: This isn’t just any dog. It’s Justice Upholder’s K-9. Did it just pass judgment?

A sharp-eyed netizen corrected: Hold up, people. That’s a retired detection dog. They don’t bite without reason!

Someone else added: I’ve seen this before. Sven’s signaling he found something—probably drugs.

The comments flew wildly as the studio descended into pandemonium. All eyes were locked on Sven and Gabriel, their confrontation stealing the spotlight.

No one noticed Evelyn on stage.

When Sven lunged, Evelyn instinctively moved to intervene but was no match for the dog’s speed. Her heel caught the edge of the platform, and she stumbled backward.

As she braced for impact, a deep, commanding voice cut through the noise.

"Don’t fight it. Fall. I’ve got you."

Evelyn’s mind barely registered the words, but she recognized Nathan’s voice instantly.

For a heartbeat, she considered surrendering—letting gravity take her, trusting he’d catch her. There was something undeniably reassuring about his tone, as if the outcome was already certain.

But instinct overrode trust. At the last second, she twisted midair, pushing off the stage to land on her feet.

As she descended, she saw Nathan waiting below, arms outstretched. His gaze, steady and intense, ignored the surrounding chaos, focusing solely on her.

She hadn’t even noticed him rushing forward.

His tailored suit strained against his muscular frame, every line of his body radiating strength. If she had let him catch her, she’d have been cradled securely against him.

A flicker of regret danced through her.

Instead, Evelyn landed hard—right into Nathan’s arms. The collision forced a quiet oof from her lips as she collided with his solid chest.

Thankfully, Nathan’s stance was unshakable. Anyone else might have been knocked flat by the force of her fall.

But not him.

Never him.

Nathan caught Evelyn as she stumbled, gently setting her down but keeping his hands lightly on her arms. His dark eyes searched hers with quiet concern. "Are you hurt?"

"Just startled. Thank you." Evelyn's pulse fluttered like a trapped bird beneath her skin. The warmth of his touch lingered, making her cheeks burn. She couldn't bring herself to meet his gaze.

A shrill scream shattered the moment.

"Get off, you beast! Gabriel, move!" Claudia's voice sliced through the garden.

Evelyn jerked back to reality, slipping from Nathan's hold to assess the chaos.

What's gotten into Sven? She couldn't check the dog directly—not with everyone watching—but a glance at Gabriel's thoughts made her blood run cold.

Oh God. He's insane. Drug smuggling? Hiding contraband there of all places?

The Blackwoods turned at the commotion, their curious stares landing on Evelyn and Nathan standing close. Before they could speculate, Evelyn's mental outcry exploded like a grenade in their minds, drowning out all other noise.

###Chapter 173 Striking Gold

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, scrolling through her phone absentmindedly—until a particular headline made her nearly choke on her drink.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman at 3 AM!"

Evelyn's fingers froze. Her pulse spiked. The accompanying blurry photo showed Nathan—her Nathan—exiting a luxury hotel with a statuesque blonde wrapped around his arm. The timestamp? Last night.

Her mind whirled. He told me he was working late.

Before she could spiral further, her phone buzzed. A text from Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant:

"You need to see this."

Attached was a screenshot of a private group chat—Victoria Hayes’s inner circle. The messages were brutal:

"Finally, he’s bored of her."
"That gold-digger didn’t last long, huh?"
"Bet she’s crying into her designer pillows."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palm. Victoria, Nathan’s venomous secretary, had been waiting for this moment.

Then—another notification. Nathan’s name flashed on her screen.

Her thumb hovered. Should she answer? Confront him? Play dumb?

The phone rang again. This time, it was Preston Whitmore, her agent.

"Evelyn, turn on Celeb Today," he said urgently. "Now."

She grabbed the remote. The screen lit up with breaking news:

"Insiders claim Nathan Blackwood’s relationship with Evelyn Sinclair was a PR stunt orchestrated by his family to clean up his playboy image. Sources say the real woman in his life is..."

The screen cut to a paparazzi shot of Nathan leaning close to whisper in a woman’s ear—Seraphina Delacroix, the rising actress notorious for stealing leading men.

Evelyn’s tea cup shattered on the floor.

Evelyn's inner monologue left the Blackwood family speechless.

If it weren't for Sven's identity and actions, they would have thought they were hearing things.

Gabriel trafficking drugs? Here? Could it really be happening right under our noses?

The Blackwoods didn’t know whether to look at Evelyn or Gabriel.

Evelyn was just as shocked. She never imagined Gabriel would be reckless enough to get involved in something so dangerous. He was already failing spectacularly at fraud—now he was dabbling in drug trafficking? Unbelievable.

Unable to resist, she scrutinized him carefully.

He’s completely lost it. So terrified of facing his own failures that he agreed to the underground casino owner’s terms. He thought it would be simple—just move a package under police surveillance, hand it off, and his debts would vanish. The crowded venue, a public place, made it the perfect cover. So, he arranged to meet in the restroom after the show, when the audience would be flooding out. Gabriel was too scared to carry the package openly, so he resorted to the same old trick—hiding it, just like he did with the pearl necklace… Who would’ve thought… Hah. Sven’s still proving his worth, even in retirement. Gabriel, you’re digging your own grave. Before, there was barely any evidence against you—now? You’re handing it over on a silver platter.

Evelyn’s expression darkened. After everything that had just happened, seeing Gabriel dive headfirst into drug trafficking to cover his mistakes made her sick to her stomach.

Does he even realize how many lives have been lost keeping this poison out of our country?

The Blackwoods’ expressions shifted as they absorbed Evelyn’s thoughts.

Too furious to notice their reactions, Evelyn barely registered Nathan pulling out his phone to call Daniel.

"Sven alerted us. He bit Gabriel. Gabriel’s been acting off since he arrived—too conscious of the time."

Nathan fabricated the details, knowing Daniel’s instincts would lead him to suspect Gabriel was hiding drugs and preparing for a handoff.

Daniel had been watching the live broadcast, partly out of curiosity about Nathan and Evelyn’s current dynamic, but mostly because he had arranged for Sven’s temporary assignment. He needed to keep an eye on things.

When he saw Sven’s sudden aggression, alarm bells went off. He immediately began deploying officers to the studio.

At first, Daniel assumed the celebrity was just using drugs.

But as more information came in, his expression darkened. He contacted the narcotics unit without hesitation. "We missed a lead last time. This might be our chance."

The narcotics team was stunned. How did Daniel manage to crack a case while watching a variety show in the middle of his packed schedule?

It was like striking gold.

The nearest police station sprang into action, sealing off all exits from the studio building. No one would escape unnoticed.

Inside, chaos reigned.

Isabelle Laurent arrived with her team, her sharp gaze scanning the scene.

Claire Harrison, seeing her son Gabriel being mauled by the police dog, lunged forward—only to be yanked back by the trainer.

Something was wrong. The trainer immediately began evacuating the crowd.

"Stay back!" he barked. "Gabriel, stop resisting! If you keep struggling, I’ll have no choice but to let Sven restrain you!"

Claudia Bennett shoved the trainer aside. "What the hell are you saying? Who do you think you are? Call off your damn dog!"

The trainer, lacking official authority, could only repeat firmly, "If he stops resisting, Sven will release him!"

But Gabriel couldn’t stop. The guilt and terror twisting inside him were unbearable—like a condemned man fighting his execution.

Even as Sven’s teeth sank deeper, Gabriel thrashed, kicking wildly with his free leg.

Sven dodged effortlessly, loosened his grip—then clamped down again the second Gabriel tried to scramble away.

Claire had been ready to rush to her son’s side, but the trainer’s words froze her in place.

Her family had military ties. She knew police dogs didn’t act without reason.

And Sven wasn’t attacking—he was preventing an escape.

The realization hit her like a bullet.

Something’s very wrong with Gabriel.

When she remembered Sven’s training—drug detection—her face drained of color.

Her prestigious family name, tarnished by this? The disgrace was unthinkable.

She stood paralyzed, the world tilting around her.

Meanwhile, Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe summoned security.

Evelyn Sinclair’s expression soured at their approach.

They were here to help—but Nathan Blackwood stepped forward first.

"Evacuate the crowd," he ordered.

Preston and Donovan hesitated, but Nathan added, "Police are on their way. Keep everyone calm."

The two men exchanged stunned glances.

The situation was spiraling out of control.

The studio was in chaos. What was supposed to be a smooth variety show filming had turned into a nightmare. Why were the police here?

Just when they thought the storm had passed, another wave crashed over them. They should’ve known better than to underestimate anyone from Team A-list.

"Don’t just stand there! Do something!" Claudia Bennett’s voice trembled with panic, her eyes brimming with tears.

Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe exchanged frantic glances. The security guards remained frozen, waiting for instructions that never came.

Then, the police stormed in. Officers quickly identified Preston and Donovan, securing the scene before either could react.

Numb with shock, the director and producer complied mechanically, their minds racing. When the words "drug bust" were mentioned, their legs nearly gave out beneath them.

Gabriel Ramirez, sensing trouble, tried to bolt—only for Sven to tackle him again, as if mocking his futile attempt.

Within moments, Gabriel was isolated in custody.

Claudia, hysterical, actually demanded the officers arrest the dog instead.

The looks she received ranged from disbelief to outright pity.

When the police confirmed her connection to Gabriel, the cuffs snapped around her wrists.

Claudia’s face went blank with shock.

The entire studio was steeped in surreal disbelief.

This was supposed to be entertainment. How did we end up in handcuffs?

Yet, seeing the celebrities seated calmly, the audience didn’t panic. Instead, whispers erupted, phones lighting up as they scrolled through feeds.

The live stream had been cut—but not before the internet exploded.

Preston and Donovan had no choice. Letting the audience watch a dog maul a person was a PR disaster.

Even with the broadcast halted, social media was already ablaze.

Only then did the studio crew notice the flashing lights outside. They were surrounded.


The fallout was just beginning.

###Chapter 174 The Storm Unleashed

The tension in the penthouse was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair clutched her phone, her knuckles white. Nathan Blackwood stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders rigid with barely contained fury. The city lights flickered below, casting long shadows across his chiseled features.

"You knew," Evelyn whispered, her voice trembling. "All this time, you knew."

Nathan turned slowly, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "I had my suspicions," he admitted, his deep voice laced with regret. "But I needed proof before I could act."

Evelyn's heart pounded in her chest. The betrayal cut deeper than she had anticipated. Victoria Hayes, the woman she had trusted as her secretary, had been playing a dangerous game behind the scenes.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted the heavy silence. Lillian Graves, Evelyn's assistant, stepped in hesitantly. "Ma'am, there's an urgent call for you. It's Preston Whitmore."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Nathan before taking the phone. The director's voice crackled through the line, frantic. "Evelyn, we have a problem. The press just got wind of the scandal. It's everywhere."

Her stomach dropped. "How?"

"Someone leaked the footage," Preston said grimly. "It's all over social media."

Nathan snatched the phone from her hand. "Pull every string you have. We need damage control now."

Evelyn sank onto the couch, her mind racing. The carefully constructed facade of her career was crumbling, and the vultures were circling. But one thing was certain—she wouldn't go down without a fight.

Across the room, Nathan's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening further. "It's Julian," he muttered. "He says Harrison Montgomery is involved."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Harrison—the famous actor married to Natalie Whitaker—was tangled in this mess too? The web of deceit was far more extensive than she had imagined.

Nathan pocketed his phone and strode toward her, determination burning in his eyes. "We're ending this tonight."

Evelyn nodded, steeling herself. Whatever came next, they would face it together.

But as the clock ticked toward midnight, one chilling question remained—who else was hiding in the shadows?

One netizen posted: Can someone explain what just went down?

Another replied: Seriously? You see the police cars and Gabriel's actions, and you still don't get it?

A third chimed in: So Gabriel was actually involved in drugs?

A skeptical comment followed: Is this another one of Team A-List’s publicity stunts? Coordinating with the cops for drama? That’s next-level marketing.

A sarcastic reply shot back: Pure coincidence. Who knew Team A-List would bring in a sniffer dog? Gabriel just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Talk about bad luck.

Another user laughed: If this is a coincidence, it’s the funniest thing ever. We were all arguing about Gabriel’s innocence. Well, case closed.

A dramatic post read: A simple variety show turned into a crime scene. Classic Team A-List—never a dull moment.

One fan joked: First, Evelyn exposes industry scandals, now she’s uncovering actual crimes? Iconic.

Another agreed: Evelyn never fails to deliver the drama.

Evelyn sat in the audience, scrolling through the chaos online. She groaned.

How is this my fault? she thought. Danielle borrowed Sven, Gabriel brought the drugs, and I was just sitting here! Unbelievable.

The Blackwoods around her were torn between amusement and exasperation.

No one had seen this coming.

Vivienne was still reeling from the whispers about drug trafficking. It was beyond anything she’d imagined.

Claire, Gabriel’s mother, had already left to assist with the investigation.

At this point, the show’s outcome didn’t matter. Once the police arrested the dealer hiding in the restroom, the audience was free to go.

After verifying identities, everyone was released.

As the Blackwoods passed through the venue, they spotted Daniel Wright in the middle of the chaos.

Despite his hectic schedule, Daniel flashed them a grin, his gaze lingering on Evelyn.

Sure, things had gone sideways—but without Evelyn and Julian’s little performance, the police wouldn’t have landed such a major bust.

The unexpected turn of events had left Roland with a newfound appreciation for Evelyn Sinclair.

Nearby, a group of young officers cast admiring glances at Evelyn and Julian, their expressions a mix of awe and gratitude.

"You were incredible. Let me take you both out for dinner as thanks," Roland offered, his tone sincere.

"Just luck," Nathan murmured, though his mind was already racing.

Damn. I didn’t even consider the contact in the restroom, but they already caught him. Tonight turned out better than expected. If I check the contact myself, maybe— His thoughts screeched to a halt. Why didn’t I think of that sooner? Let’s see…

Nathan’s expression darkened. Could it really be?

What? I can’t see anything? His frustration flared. Right. Too much interference with reality means limited access. This system only scrapes the surface—gossip, not secrets. What a waste.

He realized then that Evelyn wasn’t omniscient. Her abilities only revealed fragments—simple, surface-level information tied to individuals or their immediate connections.

For example, uncovering Gabriel’s details had led to the contact. If Evelyn probed further, she might catch trivial details about related figures—things the police could dig up themselves—but nothing that would expose the mastermind outright. That would tip the scales too far.

Nathan sighed. It was disappointing, but logical. If Evelyn’s powers were limitless, the balance would shatter.

With that realization, neither he nor Evelyn dwelled on it further.

After a brief exchange with Roland, Nathan guided his family toward the exit.

At the studio’s entrance, Sven lay sprawled on the ground, exhausted.

The moment the dog spotted Evelyn, it scrambled to its feet, tail wagging furiously, whining softly.

The trainer chuckled. "He’s apologizing for not finishing the performance with you."

Evelyn crouched, scratching behind Sven’s ears. "Don’t be silly. You were amazing. What you did was far more important than my little act. Good boy, Sven!"

Thrilled by the praise, Sven nuzzled her leg affectionately.

The group couldn’t resist snapping photos with the heroic K-9 before finally leaving.

Outside, chaos still simmered. Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe looked utterly drained as they managed the aftermath, their clothes rumpled, their expressions weary.

Danielle even approached them, offering a few words of sympathy.

Then, from the crowd, two sharp, resentful gazes locked onto Evelyn.

Evelyn Sinclair was utterly bewildered.

“This wasn’t my doing. I had no prior knowledge of any of this,” Evelyn protested, her voice firm. “Besides, isn’t this a good outcome? We helped catch criminals.”

“We’re glad to have done our civic duty, but our nerves can’t take much more of this. We’d like to live a few more years,” Donovan Sharpe said, his voice trembling as if on the verge of tears.

Preston Whitmore threw his hands up in exasperation. “Next time you decide to join a show, could you please avoid dragging us into it? I think we’re fundamentally incompatible.”

The others stifled their laughter, though the tension in the room made it difficult to indulge in humor.

Honestly, who had ever heard of a variety show spiraling into such chaos? It was unprecedented—an absolute spectacle in the entertainment industry. But this was just an unfortunate coincidence, and there was nothing anyone could do about it now. All they could offer were sympathetic pats on the back.

Little did they know, the storm had only just begun.

Though social media was ablaze with wild theories, the production team and participating celebrities remained tight-lipped, waiting for the official police statement.

Only the live audience from the broadcast studio that night could provide any real insight, but separating fact from fiction was proving impossible.

As the night wore on, however, the leaks took a darker turn.

One netizen posted: My neighbor is [REDACTED]. The police showed up at their place at midnight!

Another chimed in: Guys, my girlfriend works PR for an artist. She got yanked out of bed for an emergency meeting. Something big is going down.

A third comment read: Did someone report my upstairs neighbor? Usually, they’re just noisy, but tonight, the cops showed up. I peeked—turns out it’s [REDACTED], that famous actor!

Yet another claimed: Paparazzi just snapped photos of multiple celebrities being escorted into police cars.

Confusion spread like wildfire. What the hell is happening? I thought only Gabriel Ramirez got busted tonight?

By morning, the rumors had spiraled into something even more outrageous.

Evelyn had slept through the night, blissfully unaware. It wasn’t until she sat down for breakfast and scrolled through Twitter that she realized the extent of the chaos. Her brows furrowed in bewilderment.

Around the breakfast table, the gossip was relentless.

“What on earth happened?” Genevieve gasped, eyes wide.

Julian scrolled through his phone, lips pressed into a thin line. “Apparently, multiple celebrities had their homes raided last night. Industry insiders are whispering about drug use.”

Richard sighed. “So this is connected to Gabriel’s arrest? He was trafficking, not using, right?”

Margaret’s fingers flew across her screen as she muttered in disbelief, “Good heavens. If this is all linked, some of these ‘wholesome’ celebrities might be .”

Sophia's warning rang in Evelyn's ears: "Celebrity worship comes with dangerous consequences!"

With trembling fingers, Evelyn scrolled through the breaking news alerts. It wasn't Gabriel Ramirez at the center of this storm after all—it was his connection, a shadowy figure who'd been supplying narcotics to A-list celebrities for years. The real bombshell? The dealer kept meticulous records of every artist he'd ever supplied.

"Holy..." Evelyn's breath hitched as the implications hit her. This wasn't just a scandal—it was an atomic bomb about to detonate across the entertainment industry. How many careers would crumble when those names surfaced? She could already picture the devastation among fan communities worldwide—heartbroken devotees watching their idols' carefully constructed images shatter overnight.

The article continued with chilling details: encrypted ledgers, coded messages, and a network that reached into the highest echelons of show business. This wasn't merely about recreational drug use—it hinted at coercion, blackmail, and an entire system of control.

Evelyn's phone buzzed with frantic messages from Lillian, her assistant: "Are you seeing this? The studio's in lockdown. Publicists are having meltdowns. This changes EVERYTHING."

As she refreshed the page, three more major outlets picked up the story. The tsunami of revelations had only just begun. Somewhere in Los Angeles, powerful people were scrambling to contain the damage—but the genie couldn't be forced back into the bottle.

A thought struck Evelyn with icy clarity: Whoever leaked this information didn't just want to expose the drug ring—they intended to burn the entire entertainment industry to the ground. And in the ashes? Only the truth would remain.

She reached for her laptop, her reporter's instincts kicking in. This story had more layers than anyone realized, and Evelyn Sinclair intended to uncover every last one—no matter who tried to stop her. The real question wasn't which celebrities would fall, but who had orchestrated their downfall... and why now?

The game had changed. The rules no longer applied. And Evelyn? She held her breath as the first celebrity name appeared in the comments section—a Grammy-winning singer whose wholesome image had just been obliterated in a single keystroke.

This was only the beginning.

###Chapter 175 You Really Are A Disappointing Son

Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her velvet chaise, sipping her matcha latte, when an unexpected wave of thoughts crashed into her mind—thoughts that weren’t hers.

"Nathan Blackwood is insufferable! How dare he ignore me at the gala last night?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. That voice—sharp, venomous—belonged to Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s scheming secretary.

A slow smirk curled Evelyn’s lips. Oh, this is going to be fun.

She focused, tuning into Victoria’s mental tirade like a radio station.

"After everything I’ve done for him—covering up his messes, handling his ridiculous schedule—and he has the audacity to fawn over Evelyn Sinclair like some lovesick puppy?"

Evelyn’s brows shot up. Lovesick puppy? She’d never seen Nathan as anything but infuriatingly composed.

Victoria’s thoughts spiraled. "I should’ve sabotaged that deal with Preston Whitmore when I had the chance. Maybe then Nathan would realize how much he needs me."

Evelyn’s amusement vanished. Sabotage? That crossed a line.

Before she could delve deeper, another voice interrupted—Serena Whitmore, her agent.

"Evelyn, darling, you’re late for your fitting. The Dior gown won’t alter itself."

Evelyn sighed, reluctantly pulling herself away from Victoria’s mental meltdown. But as she stood, a final, damning thought from Victoria slithered into her mind:

"If Nathan won’t appreciate me… maybe it’s time someone else did."

Evelyn froze. Oh no, you don’t.

She grabbed her phone, typing a quick text to Nathan:
"We need to talk. Your secretary’s plotting something. And no, I’m not being paranoid."

His reply was instant. "Meet me at The Vault. 1 PM. And Evelyn… try not to enjoy her misery too much."

She grinned. Too late.

The moment these thoughts surfaced, the Blackwood family suddenly grasped that the entertainment industry was on the brink of a seismic shift.

Stars would be arrested, blacklisted, and contracts torn apart. Countless productions would grind to a halt. Worse yet, these celebrities might drag down even more people in their fall—just imagining the chaos awaiting industry insiders in the coming days sent shivers down their spines.

This scandal could trigger a full-scale purge, wiping clean every shadowy figure lurking in Hollywood’s glittering facade.

And all of it? Sparked by a humble stage play starring a retired police K-9. Who could’ve seen that coming?

“Blackwood Group owns an entertainment subsidiary. What about their artists?” Richard frowned.

Julian chuckled. “No wonder Nathan left in such high spirits this morning.”

“Could their roster be clean?” Evelyn asked.

Julian shrugged. “Hard to say. Knowing Nathan, he’d treat this as a chance to weed out the rotten apples. Strengthens the company’s future.”

Just then, Margaret gasped. “Breaking news!”

Everyone scrambled for their phones. At the top of the trending list was an official statement—Gabriel Ramirez’s drug trafficking charges had been confirmed. A prison sentence was inevitable. The motive? Gambling debts. The investigation had even exposed an underground casino frequented by his celebrity circle, now shut down.

The truth obliterated earlier rumors.

One viral comment read: He claimed it was obsessive love? Disgusting.

Another: His whole crew ganged up to pressure her into marriage. Were they hunting an easy target?

A reply shot back: Using love as a weapon? Soul-crushing.

A thread unfolded: When manipulation failed, they set traps. This is why I’m terrified of dating.

A counterpoint emerged: Not all men are monsters. Don’t generalize.

But the most damning post stated: Ladies, if he gambles or dabbles in shady deals, RUN. You can’t fix him.

And then, the knockout punch: Remember Gabriel’s interview? He idolized his military veteran relatives. Look how he honored them.

The irony was brutal.

The fluorescent lights of the police station buzzed overhead as Gabriel Ramirez clutched the bars of the holding cell, his voice cracking with desperation. "Mom—Mom, please! You have to help me! I never meant for things to go this far! I don’t belong in here—call someone, anyone—!"

Before he could finish, Claire Harrison’s palm struck his cheek with a sharp crack. The officers nearby didn’t intervene.

"Family?" Claire’s voice trembled, her eyes red-rimmed with fury and grief. "You dare speak of family now? What about your grandparents? Your ancestors who built our name with integrity? Did you even consider the shame you’d bring upon us?"

Gabriel recoiled, his cheek stinging. Of course he’d thought of them—that’s why he’d lied, why he’d hidden the truth. Why couldn’t she see that?

"Your father would be ashamed of you," Claire spat, the words tumbling out before she could stop them.

Gabriel’s head snapped up, his gaze burning with venom. "You did this to me!" he snarled. "You want to know why I started gambling? Because of you! Your rules, your expectations—I couldn’t breathe!"

Claire staggered back as if struck. "What?"

"It was never enough for you!" Gabriel’s voice rose, raw with years of resentment. "I just wanted one thing to take the edge off, one way to feel free! And when I got in too deep, I lied because I didn’t want to disappoint you again. But you know what? You failed me first. You’re a terrible mother—so don’t you dare judge me!"

The officers exchanged uneasy glances. Claire’s knees nearly buckled.

She had been strict. After Randall’s death, she’d been terrified of failing as a single parent. She’d pushed Gabriel toward stability—military service, law school—anything respectable. But when he’d chosen music, she’d swallowed her disapproval. She’d supported him, even as he floundered.

And this was her reward?

Just then, Daniel Wright stepped forward, his voice cutting through the tension. "You’re a grown man. You made these choices. And instead of owning them, you’re blaming the woman who sacrificed everything for you? Pathetic."

Gabriel’s face twisted, but as the officers hauled him away, his bravado shattered. "Mom, please—!" he begged, reaching for her.

Claire turned away, her heart in pieces. Maybe she had failed.

As they dragged Gabriel past the interrogation rooms, Claudia Bennett’s shrill voice pierced the hallway. "This is a mistake! My godson would never traffic drugs! Release him immediately!"

The detective interviewing her sighed in exasperation. "Mrs. Harrison, we’ve been over this. Your own charges aren’t resolved yet. Sit down."

"Stop worrying about others! Tell us again—why did you take him to that supermarket studio? Were you aware of their illegal dealings?"

Claudia Bennett had been interrogated repeatedly. Now that Gabriel Ramirez was being escorted away, she threw a tantrum. "You're treating me like some common criminal! My father owns Pearson Holdings! I...I won't say another word until my lawyer arrives. I'll sue every single one of you!"

"Cooperate, Ms. Bennett!"

Claudia refused, even daring to challenge the officers' authority, which only deepened their stern frowns.

Finally, someone arrived. Claudia expected her parents with a team of high-powered attorneys, but instead, a young woman walked in.

Dressed in a sleek navy pantsuit, the woman announced she was there to handle Claudia's case.

Claudia narrowed her eyes. "Who are you? Who sent you? Are you even a lawyer? Why would they send someone so inexperienced?"

The woman ignored her, calmly introducing herself to the officers.

The name made Claudia's face contort in shock. Standing before her was Sophia Reed—her estranged biological daughter.

Sophia had only returned to visit her grandparents when news of Claudia's scandal broke, distressing them terribly. Left with no choice, she stepped in to manage the mess.

Claudia hadn't known about Gabriel's drug trafficking, but her suspicious behavior and unwilling involvement complicated matters. She wouldn’t be leaving the station tonight.

"Stay put. I’ll arrange legal counsel," Sophia said coldly, not even glancing at her.

Bristling with resentment, Claudia snapped, "Why are you here? To gloat over my humiliation? Planning to sabotage me for revenge?"

Sophia let out a sharp laugh. "Revenge? You’re not worth the effort. If not for our grandparents, I wouldn’t bother. I just never expected..." Her voice trailed off, heavy with unspoken disappointment.

###Chapter 176: Echoes of Betrayal

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she sipped her coffee, scrolling through her phone. A smirk played on her lips—today’s gossip columns were deliciously scandalous.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Elite Hotel with Mystery Woman," one headline screamed.

Evelyn nearly choked on her latte. Oh, this is too good.

Her mind-reading ability—a secret she guarded fiercely—hummed to life as she imagined Nathan’s reaction. She could practically hear his internal panic: "Damn it, that was just a business meeting!"

But the tabloids didn’t care about context. Neither did Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s scheming secretary, who’d likely leaked the photos herself. Evelyn could already picture Victoria’s smug grin.

Then her phone buzzed—a text from Serena Whitmore, her agent:

"Turn on E! News. NOW."

Evelyn tapped the screen, and there it was: grainy footage of Nathan and the "mystery woman" (who, upon closer inspection, was just his cousin Genevieve). The caption, however, read: "Blackwood Heir’s Secret Affair?"

Evelyn burst out laughing. Oh, Nathan, you poor, misunderstood billionaire.

But her amusement faded when another notification popped up—a DM from an anonymous account:

"You think you know everything, Evelyn. But you don’t."

Her blood ran cold.

Who the hell was this?

Claudia Bennett's expression twisted in an instant. Though she had never warmed to Sophia Reed, she still expected basic respect. The mocking glint in Sophia's eyes and her half-uttered words made Claudia snap, "What exactly are you implying?"

Sophia smirked, tilting her head. "Oh, I heard the most fascinating rumor—that you despised me, your own flesh and blood, because of some ridiculous dream. A dream where I ruined you and landed you behind bars."

Claudia stiffened, her fingers curling into fists as Sophia continued, voice dripping with amusement. "And yet, here we are. Who actually destroyed you? Me? No. It was your precious godson, Gabriel. Congratulations, Mother. Your prophecy came true—just not the way you imagined."

The officer beside them coughed into his fist, clearly fighting a laugh.

Claudia's face contorted with rage. She lunged forward, hand raised to strike, but Sophia caught her wrist effortlessly. "You gave up your rights to me," Sophia said coldly. "You don’t get to play parent now."

With that, she released Claudia’s arm and strode away, leaving her mother trembling in her wake.

As Sophia pushed open the precinct door, she nearly collided with Vivienne Monroe, who was being escorted by Daniel Wright to finalize paperwork for the fraud case. Sophia didn’t recognize them and made to step past—until she heard Claudia’s enraged shriek behind her.

"You!" Claudia snarled, rounding on Vivienne. "This is all your fault, you conniving little witch! If it weren’t for you, none of this would’ve happened! Admit it—you set this up, didn’t you?"

Daniel rolled his eyes so dramatically that Sophia paused, momentarily thrown. She’d expected police officers to be stern, professional. Not... this. And yet, something about him tugged at her memory. Had she seen him before?

Vivienne, however, had clearly reached her limit. She met Claudia’s glare head-on, voice icy. "Mrs. Harrison, are you still deluding yourself? The drugs were found on Gabriel. How, exactly, is that my doing?" She paused, then feigned sudden realization. "Ah, but now that you mention it—I remember why you hated me so much. You accused me of stealing your necklace."

Claudia blanched, clearly unprepared for Vivienne to air this publicly.

"Funny thing," Vivienne mused. "That necklace did go missing. But if it was stolen... well, who had access? Who suddenly started paying off gambling debts around that time?" Her gaze dropped pointedly to the pearls around Claudia’s throat. "That necklace alone would cover quite a few debts, wouldn’t it?"

Every eye in the room locked onto Claudia’s jewelry.

Claudia’s hand flew to her neck, fingers tightening around the strand. "You’re lying! Gabriel would never—"

"Wouldn’t he?" Vivienne arched a brow. "He was my boyfriend once too. And yet, he still took secret photos of me and tried to blackmail me. Face it, Claudia—your golden boy wasn’t so golden after all."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Some habits became second nature over time. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have perfected such a method for smuggling drugs so effortlessly.

Had he not been caught mid-operation—had Claudia not alerted the authorities—he might never have been exposed. Vivienne shuddered in relief, grateful she had never been fond of jewelry. The thought of having worn that necklace made her stomach churn.

Claudia stood frozen, her face drained of color. Even the officers, including Daniel, recoiled, their expressions twisting in disgust.

"That massive pearl necklace could hide that?" Daniel muttered under his breath, then added dryly, "If so, his operation was modest. The proctologist might’ve missed a few... souvenirs."

The words struck Claudia like a physical blow. Her legs buckled, but no one rushed to steady her—not even Sophia, who now understood the horrifying truth. Disgust rooted everyone in place. In the end, Claudia caught herself against the wall, trembling.

When reality crashed over her, she clawed at the necklace, desperate to tear it off—but her hands froze mid-air. Despite meticulous care, the pearls were... tainted.

Like a venomous serpent coiled around her throat, she couldn’t bear to touch it—yet leaving it on was unbearable. A strangled gasp escaped her before her eyes rolled back, and she collapsed.

Paramedics arrived swiftly, loading her onto a stretcher. Sophia had no choice but to follow, though her reluctance was palpable.

Outside, Daniel turned to Sophia. "You're Mrs. Harrison's daughter, right? Riding in the ambulance?"

"I’ll take my car," Sophia replied curtly. She braced for judgment—her coldness would surely draw criticism—but Daniel only nodded, assigning another officer to accompany Claudia. His lack of reaction made Sophia study him closer.

"Sophie."

A voice cut through the tension. She turned to see a young man—Mason—pausing mid-step when he noticed Daniel. A flicker of unease crossed his face before he schooled his features.

Daniel, ever observant, caught the shift but said nothing.

Mason closed the distance, concern lacing his tone. "I just saw your mother being taken away. What happened?"

"She fainted. We’re heading to the hospital," Sophia answered flatly.

Mason slung an arm around her shoulders. "Let’s go."

Their intimacy was unmistakable—a couple, clearly. Sophia offered Daniel a stiff nod, while Mason flashed him a polite smile. But his final glance held something darker—a silent challenge.

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly, sensing something amiss. But the police station buzzed with activity, leaving no room for contemplation. The celebrity drug scandal demanded immediate attention—arrest lists needed finalizing, press releases drafted.

Within minutes of publishing the implicated stars' names, social media platforms collapsed under the traffic surge. Even gossip forums notorious for handling celebrity meltdowns crashed spectacularly.

Watching the Blackwoods desperately refresh their screens, one could visualize millions doing the same worldwide.

"My classmates are hysterical!" Genevieve exclaimed, scrolling through screenshots flooding her group chat. "Three of their favorite idols just got exposed!"

Sophia gaped at her phone. "Our hospital's work chat is exploding with memes."

Richard sighed. "Blackwood Group's partnerships are safe, but three brand ambassadors are on that list."

Margaret shook her head. "Daniel won't be home for dinner tonight."

Julian shrugged. "Standard crisis protocol—issue termination notices before sunrise."

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "Isabelle's raging in our studio group. One of her lead actors just torpedoed Rebecca's entire shooting schedule. Thank God she's still riding high from signing Vivienne, or heads would roll."

As servers stabilized, the internet descended into chaos.

Timelines overflowed with heartbroken fans mourning their fallen idols. Just as the Blackwoods reveled in the spectacle, Evelyn's phone buzzed violently.

"Bloody hell!" she hissed. "Why am I still trending at #1?"

The Blackwood clan exchanged glances before scrambling for their devices.

###Chapter 177: The Reaper's Shadow Descends

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the bustling café, she knew today would be anything but ordinary. The air was thick with whispered conversations, and she couldn’t help but eavesdrop—mentally, of course.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, slid into the seat opposite her, eyes gleaming with barely contained excitement. "You won’t believe what I just heard," she murmured, leaning in conspiratorially.

Evelyn arched a brow, stirring her latte with deliberate calm. "Try me."

Lillian’s voice dropped even lower. "Vincent Holloway was spotted leaving Seraphina Delacroix’s penthouse at three in the morning."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Vincent Holloway—the notorious playboy—and Seraphina, the rising starlet? That was unexpected.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Nathan Blackwood lit up the screen: "We need to talk. Now."

Her pulse spiked. Nathan never texted like that unless something serious had happened.

Lillian noticed her expression and frowned. "Bad news?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I don’t know yet."

As she stood to leave, a familiar voice cut through the café’s chatter. "Well, well, if it isn’t Evelyn Sinclair."

She turned to see Vanessa Sterling, Harrison Montgomery’s infamous mistress, smirking at her. The woman’s crimson lips curled into a knowing smile. "Rumor has it you’re digging into things that don’t concern you."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. "Rumors are often wrong."

Vanessa’s laugh was like shattered glass. "Are they?"

Before Evelyn could retort, another text from Nathan arrived: "Meet me at the penthouse. It’s about Sophia."

Her stomach dropped. Sophia Blackwood—Nathan’s sister—was involved in this mess now?

Lillian grabbed her arm. "You okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "I’ll be fine."

But as she strode out of the café, one thought echoed in her mind: This was just the beginning.

The Blackwood family had scrolled through the trending list, their expressions shifting from amusement to disbelief. Not only was Evelyn Sinclair dominating the top spot, but the first three hashtags were all about her. Only after those did they find the scandalous downfall of a once-beloved celebrity.

One headline hailed Evelyn as the "Modern-Day Nemesis," with netizens worshipping her like a deity.

Another trend urged aspiring stars to seek Evelyn's approval if they wanted an unshakable career.

The third hashtag was a direct plea for Evelyn to pass judgment on another celebrity.

It was like witnessing mass hysteria in real time! Who in the world had orchestrated this madness? The Blackwoods bit back laughter, their shoulders trembling with suppressed amusement.

Evelyn eyed the fallen stars—none of whom were trending as fiercely as she was—and couldn’t shake the suspicion that she was being used as a shield. But after a quick call to Isabelle Laurent, she had to accept the truth: no one was manipulating the trends. This was purely the result of the internet’s obsessive devotion. Damn it. The internet really loves me too much.

A chorus of stifled coughs erupted around her.

Evelyn shot them a glare, convinced they were laughing at her newfound notoriety.

Feeling her sharp gaze, the Blackwoods immediately shifted to gossiping about the disgraced celebrities.

The situation was dire. Not only had several rising stars been exposed, but even industry veterans—some who had publicly advocated for rehabilitation—were implicated. Countless films and shows were pulled overnight. Brands terminated contracts. Productions scrambled to edit out the accused.

The entertainment industry was in chaos, with furious staff members venting online.

This was a purge—swift, merciless, and utterly unexpected.

Twitter accounts of the accused were suspended, leaving only hollow statements from their agencies and devastated fan pages with blacked-out profile pictures.

Some fans refused to believe the allegations, scrambling for explanations. Overseas supporters dismissed the scandal as an overreaction, claiming their idols were being unfairly targeted.

But the majority of the public stood firm: drug use was unforgivable.

"I stayed silent before, not knowing the truth. Now that I do, I demand justice."

The Grim Reaper had arrived—and Evelyn Sinclair was at the center of the storm.

The internet was ablaze with outrage.

"A former officer? How vile!"

"They're supposed to be role models! And yet they're poisoning the minds of the youth!"

"Look at how twisted young values have become. It's horrifying."

Morality often bends under the weight of beauty—until reality strikes with brutal clarity.

"Blacklist these disgraceful artists. Never let them return."

"I can't fathom how anyone could indulge in this filth. It's tainted with blood—how can they stomach it?"

There was no reasoning with mindless fans. They were nothing but society’s leeches.

"If we excuse these scandal-ridden artists, what justice is there for the heroes who died fighting?"

"We owe Justice Upholder for this reckoning. Without their exposure, those sacrifices would’ve been forgotten."

But amidst the chaos, one truth stood out—the show had unearthed a phenomenon: Evelyn Sinclair.

"Hah! 'My Acting Skill'? More like 'The Reaper’s Shadow.' It silences the entire industry the moment it airs."

"I underestimated Evelyn. I thought the scandals had peaked. I thought she had nothing left. But no—she shattered boundaries. After moral cleansing, she’s ready for legal warfare."

The online frenzy was a mix of mockery and awe. Even officials praised Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe for their bold production.

But opportunists lurked in the shadows. Innocent artists were smeared in the crossfire. With rumors swirling, truth became elusive. Many were misled.

At first, the accused could only defend themselves. "Our accounts are still active—that proves our innocence!" But their pleas fell on deaf ears.

Then—Vivienne Monroe was dragged into the storm.

Evelyn froze when she saw the new trending topic.

"Someone actually claimed Vivienne was involved?"

The Blackwood family immediately dug into the rumors. What they found left them stunned.

"Because of Gabriel Ramirez, his ex-girlfriend must be guilty? What kind of twisted logic is that?" Genevieve snapped.

The backlash was swift. But beneath the outrage, darker forces were at play—someone was pulling strings.

And Evelyn? She was just getting started.

"Does Vivienne have enemies?" Margaret asked curiously, her manicured fingers tapping against her champagne flute.

Julian arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "By now, the entire industry knows we've signed Vivienne Monroe. Who in their right mind would dare cross Justice Upholder?"

Evelyn Sinclair nearly rolled her eyes, though she couldn't deny the truth in his words.

"Then it must be someone outside the industry?" Richard Blackwood mused, his deep voice laced with suspicion.

Sophia Blackwood's eyes flashed with realization. "Her relatives, perhaps? Weren't they threatening retaliation?"

Bingo.

Evelyn immediately accessed her system to verify. Sure enough, Adriana and Bartholomeo had seized this moment to strike back, convinced that Vivienne's legal accusations were their final undoing. Pathetic fools.

The Blackwood family exchanged glances, their expressions mirroring the same thought: utter idiocy.

But the situation took an unexpected turn.

Vivienne swiftly took to Twitter to clarify the allegations. Yet, to everyone's shock, Adriana and Bartholomeo appeared in person—holding up their IDs like some twisted proof—to publicly denounce her. Tears streamed down their faces as they wailed about Vivienne's "betrayal," accusing her of abandoning family for fame.

"She cares more about justice than her own blood!" Adriana sobbed into the camera, her voice trembling with performative grief. "After everything I sacrificed to raise her!"

The internet erupted.

Relatives turning against their own? It was a spectacle too juicy to ignore. Netizens, ever eager for drama, immediately split into factions. Some swallowed Adriana's theatrics whole, while others—loyal fans of the production—remained skeptical.

"If Vivienne were involved, wouldn't she be on Javier's list too?"

"Exactly. She’s too close to Gabriel Ramirez to be clean."

"Wait, didn’t Adriana and Bartholomeo force her into that sham engagement? Hypocrites much?"

Skepticism flooded Adriana’s mentions, but when comments began mysteriously vanishing, the backlash only intensified. Nothing fueled online fury faster than censorship.

Meanwhile, Vivienne was no longer the helpless girl they remembered.

Ignoring the chaos, Isabelle Laurent pulled Vivienne into a strategic Twitter storm. A new post went live:

"Celebrating our newest powerhouse signing! Welcome to the family, @VivienneMonroe."

Then, like clockwork, Julian, Evelyn, and Rebecca Blackwood amplified the message, their collective influence undeniable. With a single retweet, Evelyn Sinclair—Hollywood’s most trusted voice—silenced ninety-nine percent of the doubt.

The Grim Reaper had arrived. And this time, she wasn’t playing defense.

No matter how desperately Adriana and Daniel begged, waving fabricated documents as evidence, the world had already turned its back on them. Their pleas fell on deaf ears, their credibility shattered beyond repair.

Then came the final blow—Isabelle Laurent's viral tweet that set social media ablaze: "Step one of joining our agency? A full medical evaluation for all employees. Safety first, darling."

The internet erupted. Memes flooded timelines. Hashtags trended. Adriana's name became synonymous with scandal, while Daniel's reputation crumbled to dust.

Somewhere in a penthouse overlooking the city, Evelyn Sinclair smirked as she refreshed her feed. The game was far from over—but the reaper had already marked his prey.

###Chapter 178 Temporary Exit


The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her latte, scrolling through her phone absentmindedly—until a particular headline caught her eye.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Her fingers tightened around the phone as she zoomed in on the grainy paparazzi shot. The woman’s face was obscured, but the way Nathan’s arm wrapped possessively around her waist sent a sharp pang through Evelyn’s chest.

"Oh, this is rich," she muttered, tossing her phone onto the couch.

But then—she heard it.

A whisper of thought, faint but unmistakable, drifting into her mind like smoke.

"God, I hope Evelyn doesn’t see those photos. She’ll skin me alive."

Evelyn froze. That voice—deep, smooth, laced with guilt—was unmistakably Nathan’s.

Her lips curled into a slow smirk. Oh, this was new.

She closed her eyes, focusing. The mental static around her sharpened into clarity, and suddenly, she was drowning in Nathan’s thoughts.

"It was just one drink. Nothing happened. But if Evelyn finds out—"

Evelyn’s smirk widened. Found out already, darling.

Then, another voice cut in—sharp, feminine, dripping with venom.

"Finally. A scandal to ruin him."

Evelyn’s eyes snapped open. That wasn’t Nathan. That was—

Victoria Hayes.

Her assistant.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Victoria had been nothing but professional, but now? Her thoughts were a viper’s nest of resentment and schemes.

"Once the press digs deeper, they’ll find out about the embezzlement. And then Nathan Blackwood will be ."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Embezzlement?

She needed to act fast.

Grabbing her phone, she dialed Serena Whitmore, her agent. "Cancel all my meetings today. Something’s come up."

Serena sighed. "Let me guess. Nathan-related?"

Evelyn’s smile was razor-thin. "Oh, you have no idea."

As she strode toward the door, Nathan’s frantic thoughts followed her.

"Why the hell did I let her talk me into that meeting? Evelyn’s going to—"

Evelyn cut the connection with a flick of her will, but not before sending one deliberate thought back.

"You’re damn right I am."

The door slammed behind her.

That very night, Isabelle Laurent took action. She posted a series of photos—Vivienne Monroe undergoing a thorough medical examination, each test result meticulously documented to prove she had never touched drugs.

With undeniable evidence now public, no one dared to slander Vivienne again.

The moment the medical report was released, Isabelle swiftly issued a statement: We will be filing a defamation lawsuit against Adriana and Gabriel Ramirez.

The announcement sent shockwaves through the media.

Inspired by Vivienne’s case, other wronged artists who had been falsely accused stepped forward to defend their reputations.

But Adriana and Gabriel’s shamelessness knew no bounds. They immediately played the victim card, lamenting their lack of education and sophistication. We didn’t know any better, they cried, claiming ignorance as their defense.

They insisted they had only acted out of concern—that Vivienne’s strange behavior had led them to suspect the worst. We were just trying to protect her, they pleaded, as if their malicious lies had been born from love.

The Blackwood family was disgusted. Some people truly deserve to burn for this.

Isabelle arrived armed with receipts. She tore apart their flimsy excuses, exposing the real reason behind their smear campaign—Vivienne had demanded her stolen assets back, and they had retaliated with lies.

To ensure no future manipulation, Isabelle meticulously documented every instance of Adriana and Gabriel’s mistreatment toward Vivienne over the years.

No more guilt trips. No more emotional blackmail.

The internet erupted.

I’ve never seen a mother betray her own child like this. Is this some twisted nephew obsession?

Gabriel is vile, but Adriana? She’s a special kind of evil. Sacrificing her daughter for her brother and nephew? Does she even realize she’s ruining Vivienne’s career?

Some women are just born traitors. If Vivienne were a son, Adriana would be clawing anyone who looked at him wrong.

Adriana had spent years believing that, as a widow with a daughter, survival meant clinging to men—even when Vivienne became the family’s sole provider. No logic could penetrate her delusion.

She was selfish to the core. Offending Vivienne carried no consequences, but losing Gabriel’s favor meant abandonment. So she chose to betray her own flesh and blood.

Pathetic.

The court of public opinion had already ruled. Now, it was time for justice.

They hadn’t left Vivienne’s house yet, and Adriana pulled Victor and Victor’s son, Mason Grant, aside to devise a plan.

Seeing the netizens talking about him, Mason immediately shook off Adriana’s hand and snapped, "This is all your fault! If you had any control over your daughter, we wouldn’t be in this mess. If I get dragged into this scandal, I swear—"

Victor glared at the legal notice in his hand, his expression dark. "Listen carefully. If this goes to court, you’ll take full responsibility. You’ll say it was all your idea, that we had no part in it. If you don’t, consider yourself cut off from this family. My son won’t acknowledge you as his aunt either. Understood?"

Adriana’s face paled. "You’re abandoning me? After everything I’ve done for you—"

"Exactly," Victor spat. "Jail time, fines—whatever comes, it’s on you. This mess is because of your daughter. You deal with it. I refuse to believe she’d actually let you rot in prison."

Adriana was desperate, her mind racing for a way out. Her last hope was calling Vivienne. A few tears, a dramatic plea—surely her daughter would soften and bail them out.

But when she dialed, it wasn’t Vivienne who answered. It was Isabelle. "Ms. Monroe is unavailable due to legal proceedings. I’m handling all her affairs. There’s no need for further contact. Let the law decide the outcome."

Adriana’s blood ran cold. She couldn’t reach anyone. No allies, no sympathy.

It hit her then—Victor and Mason had never truly been on her side. And now, she’d lost the one person who might have cared.

Her sobs, her threats—even her claim she’d kill herself—fell on deaf ears.

Vivienne was gone. The betrayal had cut too deep.

Meanwhile, Evelyn, comfortably settled in the Blackwood estate, watched everything unfold with quiet satisfaction. Well done, Isabelle. Behind every victim was a villain who’d dug their own grave. Emotional blackmail? Pathetic. But she wasn’t done yet. Victor and Mason needed to face consequences too. Expose them all.

With Nathan, Julian, and Sophia around, the Blackwood manor had become a hub of gossip. Evelyn scrolled through the latest updates, sharing the juiciest bits with the others.

The scandal had exploded, dominating headlines for a week before finally dying down. The public was exhausted, and gossip blogs had likely hit their yearly quotas early.

In the end, justice was served. Adriana and Victor were convicted, and Mason lost everything—even the properties they hadn’t managed to sell were seized.

A heavy price, but at least Vivienne was finally free of the parasites. From now on, she’d answer to no one.

The court-mandated alimony remained unchanged.

Case closed.

Yet, even after the verdict was announced, snide remarks from netizens continued to swirl, accusing Vivienne of being too harsh on her own mother.

Naturally, Evelyn saw those comments. As expected, the moment things took a serious turn, self-righteous critics emerged from the shadows. After all, they weren’t the ones suffering—why should they care about another’s pain? All they wanted was to perch on their moral high ground and lecture others. Well, I’ll report every single one of them.

Members of the Blackwood family discreetly reported the offending accounts, their fingers flying across their screens in quiet efficiency.

Vivienne’s reaction, however, didn’t disappoint Evelyn. She ignored the voices of those who resented her success. Aside from occasionally checking in on Claire, she calmly regained her composure, waiting for Isabelle’s next move.

Adriana never got to see Vivienne before being imprisoned. According to Isabelle, Adriana had wept like a lost soul, murmuring over and over, "I was wrong… I was wrong…"

But it was far too late for regrets.

Once the storm had passed, the entertainment industry had undeniably become cleaner.

Of course, this also meant stepping on the toes of many powerful figures. After all, this crackdown was cutting off their cash flow—essentially slashing their golden geese.

So, some began sharpening their knives, ready to teach Julian and Evelyn a lesson, despite the Blackwood Group’s backing.

But before they could even lift a finger, Julian made an unexpected announcement—a temporary withdrawal. He was stepping back from the domestic entertainment scene to venture into international production, working behind the scenes.

This wasn’t a battlefield they could easily infiltrate. So, aside from Julian’s heartbroken fans bidding him farewell, those itching for a fight could only redirect their frustration toward Evelyn, plotting to make her their sole target.

After weeks of silence, with rumors swirling about job handovers and industry reshuffles, everyone expected Isabelle to capitalize on Justice Upholder’s momentum and propel Evelyn into A-list stardom.

But when Vivienne finally resumed work, there was no sign of Evelyn. It was as if she had merely taken a casual stroll through the entertainment world before vanishing.

The public was baffled. Was this just a hobby for her?

Only the sharp-eyed noticed that the original owner of the agency had been replaced. Julian had fully withdrawn, leaving only Evelyn behind. Had the artist turned into a business owner?

Speculations ran wild. Fans even pushed "Where is Evelyn Sinclair?" to the top of the trending list. Left with no choice, Evelyn finally responded: "Still here. Just taking a break."

Inside the agency, Isabelle rolled her eyes in exasperation. She was itching to schedule work—offers were piling up—but a certain someone was lounging around like a pampered housecat.

Typical.

"Let it go. Sometimes stepping back is the wisest move. Justice Upholder has drawn too much attention—it's becoming a liability. Once the media frenzy dies down, I'll find new projects for you." Isabelle Laurent could only offer what little comfort she could.

Evelyn Sinclair nodded obediently. What else could she do? She had already gained far more than she deserved.

Even now, Evelyn still couldn't quite believe it as she watched the two men standing before the office desk beside her.

Nathan Blackwood and Julian Blackwood were finalizing the paperwork.

Julian shrugged, a smirk playing on his lips. "I've withdrawn part of the funds for myself. The rest, which would be too troublesome to move, I'm leaving as a gift for Evelyn."

Nathan nodded in agreement. "Quirk Group will cover one-third of the investment, but it won't exceed Evelyn's share. From now on, this agency belongs solely to her."

Isabelle's lips curled into a satisfied smile. This effectively announced to the world that Quirk Group was backing them. Her earlier frustration melted away as she turned to Evelyn with a grateful expression. "Thank you. Truly."

Nathan glanced at Evelyn, amused by her delayed reaction. "Well? Are you happy?"

Evelyn nodded eagerly, though a twinge of guilt lingered. "Maybe I should use the money I left with you for my portion of the investment..."

Truthfully, she was a little confused. Why is Nathan investing under my name? Don’t I have my own money? Am I broke?

Nathan's expression darkened. Pouring all of Evelyn's funds into the agency was risky. Worse, he didn’t want her thinking she had enough financial independence to leave him. The mere idea was unacceptable.

"The money you invested hasn’t been transferred yet, so it can’t be used," he said smoothly.

Evelyn still felt uneasy. So, if we divorce... does this all still belong to me?

Nathan nearly choked on his own breath.

Julian, meanwhile, pretended he hadn’t heard a thing.

Nathan quickly added, "Besides, as your husband, what’s mine is yours—but what’s yours will always remain yours. In short, all future profits from this agency will go straight to you."

Evelyn didn’t fully grasp the intricacies of investments, but at those words, her eyes sparkled. Guilt? Who cares about guilt? Losing money is the real tragedy. Hah! Now that I have Vivienne and Lillian making money for me, what do I have to worry about? I can just lounge around, and when I get bored, I’ll jump back into the scene and enjoy the drama.

Nathan’s gaze softened. Seeing her happy was all that mattered to him.

Julian, however, found the whole situation increasingly surreal. The only woman who could ever make Nathan act like this is Evelyn.

Then, remembering the couple’s evening plans, he couldn’t resist asking, "So, are you two really going to—"

Julian's eyes sparkled with mischief as he leaned casually against the marble countertop. "How about a little get-together tonight?" His voice carried that familiar teasing lilt as he shot Nathan a meaningful look.

Nathan barely glanced up from his documents, his fingers stilling on the keyboard for just a second before resuming typing. "Whatever," he murmured, the word dripping with his characteristic indifference.

But Evelyn, who had been quietly observing from the doorway, perked up immediately. "A party?" Her emerald eyes lit up with excitement as she stepped fully into the study, the scent of her vanilla perfume preceding her. "Count me in!"

Julian's grin widened as he exchanged a knowing glance with Nathan. "Looks like we've got ourselves a party planner," he teased, nudging Evelyn playfully.

Nathan finally looked up, his stormy gray eyes locking onto Evelyn's animated face. A barely perceptible sigh escaped his lips, but the corner of his mouth twitched upward. "Fine," he conceded, though his tone suggested anything but reluctance. "But nothing extravagant."

Evelyn clapped her hands together, already mentally cataloging decorations and refreshments. "Don't worry," she assured Nathan with a wink, "I'll keep it classy." The way she emphasized the word made Julian chuckle and Nathan roll his eyes - though neither could hide their amusement.

As Evelyn dashed off to make preparations, Julian turned to his brother with raised eyebrows. "You're getting soft, big brother," he teased.

Nathan's response was to throw a paperweight at him, which Julian dodged with practiced ease, laughing as he retreated from the study. Alone again, Nathan stared at the doorway where Evelyn had stood, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips before he forcibly schooled his features back into their usual stern expression. But the documents before him suddenly seemed far less interesting than whatever Evelyn might be planning for their impromptu gathering.

###Chapter 179 A Gossip Pool

The tension in the penthouse was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair gripped the edge of the marble countertop, her knuckles turning white. Across from her, Nathan Blackwood stood with his arms crossed, his stormy gray eyes locked onto hers. The air between them crackled with unspoken accusations.

"You think I don’t know what you’ve been hiding?" Nathan’s voice was low, dangerous.

Evelyn swallowed hard, her heart pounding. She had expected this confrontation, but not so soon. Not when she was still piecing together the fragments of the truth herself.

"I don’t know what you’re talking about," she lied smoothly, lifting her chin in defiance.

Nathan’s lips curled into a humorless smile. "Don’t play games with me, Evelyn. I have eyes everywhere. You’ve been meeting with Marcus Donovan behind my back."

Her breath hitched. So he knew. But he didn’t know everything—not yet.

"It’s not what you think," she said, forcing her voice to remain steady.

"Then enlighten me." He took a step closer, his presence overwhelming. "Because from where I’m standing, it looks like betrayal."

Evelyn’s pulse raced. She had to choose her words carefully. One wrong move, and everything she’d worked for could crumble.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed violently on the counter. The screen lit up with a single name: Lillian Graves.

Nathan’s gaze flicked to the device, his expression darkening further. "Answer it," he commanded.

Evelyn hesitated, then swiped to accept the call.

"Evelyn, you need to get out of there now," Lillian’s voice was urgent, barely above a whisper. "They know about the files. They’re coming for you."

Ice flooded Evelyn’s veins. Her grip on the phone tightened. "Who’s coming?"

But the line went dead.

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. "What files?"

Evelyn didn’t answer. Instead, she grabbed her coat and bolted for the door.

Nathan moved like lightning, blocking her path. "You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on."

She met his gaze, desperation clawing at her chest. "If you care about me at all, you’ll let me leave. Now."

For a heartbeat, they stood frozen in a silent battle of wills. Then, with a muttered curse, Nathan stepped aside.

Evelyn didn’t look back as she fled into the night, the weight of secrets heavy on her shoulders.

But she knew one thing for certain—this was far from over.

And the next move would change everything.

Even though Evelyn had transformed remarkably, Julian still vividly recalled the disastrous state of the last reunion she attended with Nathan.

That had been their first gathering as a married couple—even if only on paper. As partners, Nathan had always respected Evelyn's choice to accompany him to social events where spouses were expected.

Back then, Evelyn had been consumed by paranoia over the disapproval surrounding their marriage. She guarded Nathan's every interaction, especially gatherings ripe for gossip. That time, she had gone to assert her dominance—and the outcome had been predictably catastrophic.

Several of Nathan's closest friends had just returned from abroad when they heard about the chaotic wedding. They despised Evelyn for trapping their friend in such a mess. Though they remained civil out of respect for Nathan, their coldness was palpable.

Nathan, ever the ice prince, maintained his usual detached demeanor. Evelyn, already insecure, felt suffocated in that atmosphere.

Then, someone carelessly brought up a humorous university memory—"Remember when Cassandra—"

The speaker caught herself too late, offering a hasty apology. But it was enough.

Evelyn exploded.

She flung wine in the girl's face, then slapped the man who defended her. When others intervened, she overturned the table, screaming obscenities. Nathan couldn't control her.

The reunion was ruined. Humiliated and furious, even the Blackwood family's influence couldn't salvage the situation. Nathan could only apologize before dragging Evelyn away.

At home, Evelyn collapsed into hysterics, convinced Nathan's friends despised her. She shattered vases, overturned furniture—leaving the household in chaos.

After that, Nathan declined all future invitations.

This time, however, Daniel had personally sent an invitation to the Blackwood estate—specifically for Evelyn. Perhaps recent events had softened his opinion of her.

But Julian was uneasy. That last gathering had been a nightmare. What was Evelyn planning? An apology? An attempt to reconcile with Nathan's old classmates?

Frankly, Julian didn't care much about most of them. It was Nathan's inner circle that worried him. A few had volatile tempers, and given how badly things had ended last time...

Now that Evelyn intended to attend, the entire family was on edge.

The group chat was still buzzing with the juicy gossip.

Julian couldn't help but ask again. If he were Evelyn, he’d rather jump off a cliff than face those people. Dealing with someone like Daniel was one thing, but a whole gathering? Just the thought made him want to dig a hole and disappear into it.

As he was lost in thought, Nathan  packing and handed everything to his assistant. Then, he walked over to Evelyn and said, "We should get going soon."

Evelyn had been contemplating whether to expand her agency when his voice snapped her back to reality—today was the day.

She sprang up, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Julian raised an eyebrow. "You’re actually looking forward to Nathan’s little reunion?" Had she forgotten the chaos she caused last time?

Evelyn gave a subtle nod, but inside, she was practically bouncing. Reunion? More like a boiling pot of drama! This was going to be epic. Finally, she’d get front-row seats to the mess. Nathan’s friends? Oh, they were goldmines.

Her lips twitched, betraying her glee.

Nathan noticed immediately. Is she only going for the gossip? He paused. Wait… Do my friends really have that much drama?

Julian’s curiosity flared. Something’s up. What the hell is going to happen? Damn, now I’m invested!

Evelyn’s thoughts raced: One of them watched his ex become his sister-in-law. Another is paying for a lookalike of his childhood crush. Then there’s the guy about to watch his love marry his cousin. Oh, and let’s not forget the one whose dad is marrying a woman half his age. Daniel’s the most normal, and even he knocked up his girlfriend before marriage—some "redemption arc," huh?

Nathan was stunned. What? Who—

He usually stayed out of personal drama, but he thought he’d at least hear about it. Aside from the scandal about the friend’s dad, which had already made rounds in high society, the rest was news to him.

Is she even talking about my friends?

Julian’s eyes widened. Holy shit. How wild are Nathan’s buddies? He needed to see this firsthand.

But crashing wasn’t an option. Left with no choice, he forwarded the tea to the group chat. Why suffer alone when you can drag everyone else in?

The Blackwood family, bombarded with scandalous updates but stuck miles away, replied: Are we sure this is supposed to be fun?

Nathan Blackwood arrived in a daze with Evelyn Sinclair by his side.

They were fashionably late. By the time they made their entrance, most of Nathan's inner circle had already settled in, drinks in hand and conversations flowing.

The moment Daniel Wright walked in with his new girlfriend, all eyes—especially those at the most elite table—snapped toward them.

Though it was billed as a casual reunion, unspoken hierarchies still dictated the seating arrangements. That particular table? The unofficial VIP section.

Mason Hunter was the first to break the silence, his voice dripping with disdain. "Have you lost your damn mind? You actually invited that lunatic from the Sinclair family?"

Beside him, Claire Morgan—ever the diplomat—cleared her throat. "Mason, she's Nathan's wife now. Show some respect."

Mason scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Spare me the lecture, Claire. Are you here as my ex or as Ethan's wife? Pick a lane."

Claire's smile froze.

The sharper attendees exchanged knowing glances, while the oblivious ones—like Marcus Prescott and his bubbly partner Vivian Grant—laughed it off.

Marcus nudged Mason. "What's the deal? Still not over having Claire as your sister-in-law? It's been two years, man. Move on."

Vivian giggled, twirling her cocktail straw. "Oh, I remember! You were the first one to jump in when Evelyn threw that drink in Claire's face after she 'misspoke.' Even took a slap for it. Guess family loyalty runs deep, huh?" She winked. "Adorable."

A beat of silence. Then—

"Shut. Up," Mason gritted out.

From across the table, Grayson Hart—lounging with an arm around his quiet date, Lila Carter—chuckled. He pointed at Daniel. "And here I thought you were the traitor for borrowing that police dog."

Beatrice Holloway, who'd just ended a call, arched a brow. "I caught that show. Evelyn was surprisingly decent. Heard she's been doing charity work too. She's practically the darling of the entertainment circuit now."

"All an act," Mason sneered. "Your fiancé's in the industry, isn't he? Tell her, Beatrice. Those 'good girl' personas are bought and paid for."

Beatrice merely shrugged. She never wasted breath on pointless arguments.

Lucas Thornton, seated beside her, studied Daniel through narrowed eyes. As Daniel helped his girlfriend into her chair—ignoring the tension—Lucas drawled, "Funny. You used to hate her guts."

Because while Daniel and Evelyn appeared civil now? No one forgot that he'd once been her fiercest critic.

###Chapter 180: Tangled Strands

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tightening around her coffee mug. The city below buzzed with life, but her mind was elsewhere—entirely consumed by the man who had both shattered and rebuilt her world: Nathan Blackwood.

A sharp knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, her voice steady despite the storm inside her.

Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped inside, clutching a tablet. "The press release is ready for your review. The media’s already speculating about your sudden departure from the film set."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Let them speculate." She set her mug down, the porcelain clinking against the marble countertop. "I won’t be bullied into staying where I’m not wanted."

Lillian hesitated. "Nathan’s team has been calling nonstop. They’re insisting on a meeting."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn’s lips. "Of course they are." She turned, her emerald eyes flashing. "Tell them I’m not interested in his excuses."

But even as she said the words, her traitorous heart ached. Nathan had been her downfall and her salvation, a paradox she couldn’t escape.

Across town, Nathan Blackwood paced his office like a caged predator, his usual composure fraying at the edges. The headlines blaring from his laptop mocked him: "Evelyn Sinclair Walks Off Set—Is This the End for Hollywood’s Golden Couple?"

His brother, Julian, leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "You look like hell."

Nathan raked a hand through his hair. "I need to fix this."

Julian scoffed. "You mean apologize."

Nathan’s jaw clenched. He’d spent years building walls around his heart, only for Evelyn to dismantle them brick by brick. And now, because of his own stubborn pride, he might lose her forever.

His phone buzzed—another message from his publicist. He ignored it.

"Tell Marcus to clear my schedule," Nathan said abruptly. "I’m going to see her."

Julian raised a brow. "And say what?"

Nathan’s gaze hardened with resolve. "The truth."

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit lounge, Victoria Hayes sipped her martini, a smirk playing on her lips. The chaos unfolding between Nathan and Evelyn was exactly what she’d hoped for.

Her phone lit up with a text from an unknown number: "Phase one complete. Proceed as planned."

Victoria’s fingers danced across the screen. "Understood. Let’s see how much more damage we can do."

She leaned back, savoring the taste of victory. If Evelyn thought walking away was the end, she was sorely mistaken.

The game had only just begun.

Daniel Wright was a man of unwavering principles. He had known Nathan Blackwood since their university days, and their bond was the strongest among their circle.

Nathan had always been reserved and distant since childhood, his emotions slow to surface. Daniel constantly worried someone might take advantage of his friend's quiet nature. But Nathan was sharp—no ordinary person could outmaneuver him. Still, Daniel's protective instincts never waned.

Their marriage had drawn criticism from the start. Many believed Nathan was being exploited, especially after the incident at the last gathering. Nathan was usually impeccable in handling social dynamics, rarely needing to apologize for anything. Yet, seeing him lower his head to make amends for Evelyn Sinclair’s mistake left a bitter taste in everyone’s mouth.

Back then, whispers circulated—what if Nathan and Cassandra, who had broken up abruptly, reconciled? Some even preferred their former classmate, Victoria Hayes, stepping in.

Though they disapproved of Victoria’s blatant attempts to get closer to Nathan—it felt like trespassing on sacred ground—they hadn’t interfered. Nathan seemed oblivious to her advances. But no one expected Evelyn to swoop in and claim him instead.

In the end, Victoria reaped what she sowed.

Unbelievable.

Yet, acceptance of Evelyn remained elusive.

Nathan was flawless—his character impeccable, his abilities unmatched. Having him as a friend was a point of pride, a privilege their families openly celebrated.

When Nathan was with Cassandra, everything had felt right. Like witnessing a perfect painting come to life. They had rooted for the couple wholeheartedly.

Then Evelyn arrived, and Nathan’s perfection cracked. They couldn’t stand her.

So when Daniel invited Evelyn to join them and even sent a group message about it, confusion rippled through their circle.

Even with Evelyn’s reputation shifting after her variety show appearance, they dismissed it as a facade.

Strange, how none of them had seen Nathan much in the past six months. Between romantic escapades and business trips, they’d missed Evelyn’s transformation entirely.

After listening to his friends vent, Daniel poured a steaming cup of coffee for his girlfriend before—

The room fell into an abrupt hush, all eyes fixed on the speaker.

"First," Daniel Wright began, his voice cutting through the silence, "she's changed—completely. The Evelyn Sinclair standing before us now is nothing like the one we used to know. She’s magnetic, exactly how Mr. Richard and Mrs. Margaret always described her."

Most of the group had never met the Evelyn from Richard and Margaret’s nostalgic stories, but Lucas Thornton and Grayson Hart had.

Lucas arched a brow. "You mean that Evelyn? The one who used to light up every room like a wildfire—playful, unpredictable, impossible to ignore?"

"Her? That harpy?" Mason Hunter’s lip curled in disgust, as if the mere thought left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Grayson, intrigued, released the arm of his date, Lila Carter. "Seriously? That’s how she used to be? The same woman who once threw a wine glass at me during an argument? Were Richard and Margaret just blinded by parental bias?"

Daniel shrugged. "All I know is, the current Evelyn is… fascinating. And in Vivienne Monroe’s case, it was Evelyn and Julian who stepped in to help."

"Or maybe just Julian," Marcus Prescott mused.

Vivian Grant, looping her arm through Marcus’s, scoffed. "Doubtful. Julian hated Evelyn, didn’t he?" Marcus nodded immediately, conceding her point.

Beatrice Holloway opened her mouth as if to speak, then hesitated and stayed silent.

Claire Morgan, however, bit her lip. "Maybe… it was my fault? My provocation might’ve triggered her reaction last time."

The group exchanged uneasy glances—none could deny the possibility.

Daniel pressed on. "Second—and this is the real kicker—Nathan Blackwood is smitten with her. And that has me hooked."

Every person in the room—except for Grayson’s and Daniel’s dates, who were out of the loop—knew Nathan well. At Daniel’s words, their expressions twisted in disbelief. What the hell is he talking about?

It wasn’t surprising. Even when Nathan had been with Cassandra, no one had ever accused him of being smitten.

They’d been the perfect power couple—calculated, composed, partners in every strategic sense—but never lovesick. The idea of Nathan Blackwood utterly enchanted by someone was… unimaginable.

Mason exhaled sharply, as if relieved. "Oh, that’s it. Nathan’s problem is that he takes responsibility too seriously. Evelyn’s his wife—of course he’s invested."

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the group. That explanation made sense. It was logical.

But Daniel just shook his head. Then, slowly, he began to recount the details—every glance, every unguarded moment—and the room fell silent again.

This wasn’t just duty.

This was something else entirely.

Back then, Nathan Blackwood had unexpectedly sought out Daniel Wright to handle the situation involving Vivienne Monroe.

At the time, Daniel couldn’t help but wonder—was there some hidden connection between Nathan and Vivienne?

Nathan’s answer had been smooth, effortless. "She’s a rising talent from my wife’s agency."

In truth, something this minor could’ve been delegated to one of Daniel’s subordinates. But Nathan’s words had struck him like a lightning bolt. The fact that Nathan had personally intervened for his wife’s sake—even sending Julian Blackwood to accompany her—left Daniel utterly stunned. He’d only been away for what felt like half a year, yet the world had shifted beneath his feet.

Honestly, this was the kind of mess you’d just call the cops for.

And then there was the tangled history between them—a relationship that had twisted and turned like a damn rollercoaster.

When Daniel arrived, Julian had looked just as shocked, clearly not expecting Nathan to go this far.

But that was Nathan for you. Once he set his mind on something, he committed—fully. Not even the smallest inconvenience was allowed to touch his wife.

So, considering all this, Daniel was dying to see what was really going on between those two now.

He genuinely respected Nathan as a friend. And if his friend was serious about something, Daniel would back him—no questions asked. Personal feelings didn’t matter. He’d even extend that courtesy to Nathan’s siblings.

Besides, this was also a chance to remind certain people that disrespecting him was the same as slapping Nathan in the face.

The group listened as Daniel laid it all out.

The realization wasn’t earth-shattering, but for those who’d known Nathan for years, it still felt… surreal.

A heavy silence settled over them—until Claire Morgan suddenly gasped.

Mason Hunter instinctively leaned in, brows furrowing. "What’s wrong?"

Claire bit her lip, hesitating before lifting her phone for everyone to see. "I just got a message… Cassandra’s back in the country. She heard about the gathering and wants to know where we are. She’s coming."

The air turned electric.

Even though Daniel had mentioned Evelyn Sinclair had changed, the mere mention of Cassandra’s name at the last meet-up had sent Evelyn spiraling. Now, the group could only imagine the fireworks if these two women came face-to-face.

Would they tear each other apart? Scratch, scream, pull hair?

The mental image alone was too much.

Mason smirked. "Let her come. It’s a reunion—everyone’s welcome."

Grayson Hart arched a brow, amusement glinting in his eyes. "We’re not trying to start drama. We just want to see who really owns Nathan’s heart."

And with that, the stage was set.

The night was about to get very interesting.

The crowd buzzed with anticipation, eager to witness the impending showdown.

Daniel Wright's lips twisted into a grimace. This was his doing. He had been the one to invite Evelyn Sinclair. If those two women crossed paths now—especially if Evelyn lost her temper—he'd be the first one caught in the crossfire.

No way was he playing the sacrificial lamb.

His fingers flew across his phone screen, drafting a warning to Nathan Blackwood. He'd lay out the facts—what they chose to do with the information was their business.

A few onlookers noticed his frantic typing and tried to intervene.

"Don't spoil the fun!" someone hissed.

But the thrill-seekers were already salivating at the prospect of drama.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was practically bouncing with excitement, her heels clicking against the marble floor as she strode ahead. When she realized Nathan was lagging behind, she spun around, impatience flashing in her eyes.

"Pick up the pace, will you? We're going to miss everything!"

Nathan's brow furrowed, his mind still stuck on her earlier words. Who exactly was she talking about?

###Chapter 181 Rely On Women

The Juicy Secrets in Her Head

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind already buzzing with the latest gossip she had overheard at last night’s gala.

Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Hayes were seen arguing in the hallway.

Evelyn smirked as she replayed the scene in her mind. Nathan, ever the composed businessman, had looked genuinely flustered—something rare for him. Victoria, his usually poised secretary, had been red-faced and nearly shouting.

What could have set them off?

She padded to her vanity, picking up her phone to scroll through messages. Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, had already sent her a rundown of the day’s schedule. But Evelyn’s thoughts kept drifting back to Nathan and Victoria.

Was it about work? Or something… personal?

A knock at the door interrupted her musings. "Evelyn? You up?" Serena Whitmore, her agent, peeked in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "You’re going to want to hear this."

Evelyn arched a brow. "If it’s about Nathan and Victoria, I already know."

Serena’s eyes widened. "You do?"

"Of course. They had a very public spat last night." Evelyn took the coffee, savoring the rich aroma. "But I don’t know why."

Serena leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "Rumor has it Victoria was caught snooping through Nathan’s private files. Something about a hidden contract."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Now that’s interesting.

Nathan Blackwood wasn’t the type to leave incriminating documents lying around. If Victoria had gone digging, she must have been desperate—or stupid.

"Any idea what the contract was about?" Evelyn asked, her curiosity piqued.

Serena shrugged. "No one knows yet. But if I had to guess? It’s tied to that secret project he’s been working on with Julian."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a slow smile. Oh, this is going to be fun.

She set down her coffee and reached for her tablet. If Nathan was hiding something, she was going to find out what it was—before Victoria did.

And if she happened to uncover a few more juicy secrets along the way?

Well, that was just a bonus.

Evelyn Sinclair hurried down the corridor, her mind buzzing with the latest gossip she couldn’t wait to share. As she rounded the corner, someone suddenly stumbled into her path, sending a box tumbling straight toward her.

For a split second, Evelyn couldn’t react fast enough. The box burst open, its contents scattering in her direction—until a strong arm yanked her backward.

She crashed into a solid chest, shielded completely. Not a single stray object touched her.

Nathan Blackwood had pulled her close, one arm locked around her waist, the other raised defensively in front of her. Every flying item had been deflected by his forearm.

"Are you hurt?" His deep voice rumbled above her, laced with concern despite its usual cool edge.

Evelyn blinked, startled. "I—I'm fine."

Nathan released her, and they both turned toward the figure on the ground. A young woman with a high ponytail and a black mask sat awkwardly amidst spilled cosmetics. She scrambled up, tugging her mask down, her face pale with exhaustion.

"I'm so sorry! I didn’t mean to— Oh! Ms. Sinclair?"

Evelyn recognized her instantly—Violet Carter, the assistant makeup artist assigned to their team for The Art of Performance.

"Violet?" Evelyn frowned, taking in the dark circles under her eyes. "Are you okay? You look terrible."

Violet forced a weak smile. "Just… skipped a few meals. Blood sugar drop, probably."

A distant voice called her name, and Violet quickly bowed again. "I should go. Sorry again, Ms. Sinclair!"

Before darting off, she cast a fleeting, almost nervous glance at Nathan.

As the makeup artist for their team, Violet had seen him around—enough to know he wasn’t someone you wanted to cross.

Evelyn watched her go, unease prickling under her skin. Something wasn’t right.

And Nathan’s sharp gaze followed Violet too, his expression unreadable.

Julian. Even in her professional capacity, Violet couldn't help but admire his striking features—those sharp cheekbones, the piercing gaze, the effortless charm that seemed woven into his DNA.

She'd caught whispers here and there about Nathan and Evelyn being married. But Violet wasn’t one to pry or spread rumors. Discretion was her middle name. So when she spotted the couple that evening, she kept her curiosity in check, though her artist’s eye couldn’t resist appreciating the visual harmony they created.

The pair standing before her were nothing short of breathtaking. As a makeup artist, Violet had an eye for beauty, and these two were masterpieces—Nathan with his sculpted jawline, Evelyn with her ethereal grace. She allowed herself a few stolen glances before snapping back to reality.

Finishing her sentence, Violet hastily bent to gather the scattered makeup products littering the floor. Seeing her flustered state, Evelyn instinctively knelt to help. Nathan, ever the gentleman, joined without a word.

Violet’s cheeks flushed. "Oh, no, please! You don’t have to—"

But it was too late. The three of them made quick work of the mess. As Nathan picked up the last item—a delicate, silver bracelet—his fingers stilled. The intricate design caught his attention.

Violet gasped, snatching it from his palm with trembling hands. "Thank goodness! I thought I’d lost it." She inspected the bracelet like a lifeline, relief washing over her as she tucked it safely into her pocket.

The muffled sound of someone calling her name echoed down the hall. Violet offered a hurried thanks before scurrying away, leaving Nathan and Evelyn alone.

Evelyn clicked her tongue, arms crossed. "That bracelet? Definitely a gift from a man who lives off women. I’ll give him credit—he’s got taste. But I can’t place the brand."

Nathan’s lips quirked. "Custom-made."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Expensive?"

"Not that one," Nathan admitted.

Evelyn smirked. "Figures. Well, you know what they say..."

As they walked, Evelyn couldn’t resist filling Nathan in on the latest backstage gossip. After all, it wasn’t classified information—just the usual chatter that floated around during recordings.

Nathan tilted his head, listening intently.

"She’s an assistant makeup artist for My Acting Skill—decent pay, but she’s always hustling for extra gigs. You can see the exhaustion in her eyes. And why? Because she’s bankrolling some deadbeat boyfriend."

Nathan frowned. "Bankrolling?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Two years. Two whole years she’s been supporting him. He eats her food, lives under her roof, and contributes nothing. Classic freeloader."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Pathetic."

Evelyn nodded. "Exactly. And that bracelet? Probably the only nice thing he’s ever given her—with her money, no doubt."

A beat of silence passed before Evelyn sighed. "Some women have terrible taste in men."

Nathan shot her a sidelong glance. "Good thing you don’t."

Evelyn smirked. "Flattery won’t get you out of buying me dinner later."

Nathan chuckled as they turned the corner, the weight of Violet’s situation lingering in the air.

Mason Hunter rarely left their shared apartment these days, consumed by his fledgling online business venture. Every expense—from rent to groceries—was shouldered by Violet Carter, who never once complained. In fact, she spoiled him relentlessly, ensuring he had the finest clothes, the latest gadgets, even premium organic meals. She nurtured his dreams with unwavering faith, convinced of his inevitable success. To her, this wasn’t dependence; it was partnership. The mere suggestion that Mason might be taking advantage of her devotion would spark indignation. Even her mentor, after countless failed interventions, had given up.

Nathan Blackwood arched a brow. "And her boyfriend just lets her exhaust herself like this?"

Evelyn Sinclair nodded, lips pursed. "I won’t deny there are men who genuinely need temporary support while building something. But Mason? He’s not one of them."

"Exactly," Nathan agreed, voice edged with disdain. "If he were truly struggling, he’d refuse her extravagance. Instead, he’s living comfortably while she works herself to the bone."

Evelyn’s hand landed on his shoulder with a frustrated pat. "Worse—she once took an advance payment because he crashed into a Lamborghini. They fought, of course. No compromise, just her emptying her savings to cover his recklessness." She scoffed. "Useless. Temperamental. What does she even see in him? Did he pull her from a burning building?"

Her sympathy for Violet was genuine, but so was her contempt. Yet Evelyn never considered intervening. Violet wasn’t some naive victim. She didn’t feel exploited. If anything, she seemed to revel in her sacrifices. Who was Evelyn to disrupt that delusion? She wouldn’t waste energy deciphering Violet’s logic—venting was catharsis enough.

Nathan, however, grew more perplexed. How had that bracelet ended up with Violet?

Evelyn adored gossip. Perhaps she’d appreciate a tidbit in return—something to pique her curiosity. Their conversations couldn’t always be one-sided. He needed to contribute, to engage her.

Just as he opened his mouth, movement at the hallway’s end caught his eye.

Daniel Wright emerged, pausing mid-step at the sight of them. They stood close, heads tilted together, whispering like conspirators. Nathan’s smirk suggested he’d just heard something scandalous; Evelyn’s eyes glittered with avid interest.

Daniel blinked. He’d seen them together before, but this? This felt... surreal.

###Chapter 182 His First Crush Is Coming Over

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood was already dressed, his dark eyes scanning a document with that familiar intensity.

"You're up early," she murmured, stretching beneath the silk sheets.

Nathan glanced at her, a smirk playing on his lips. "Some of us have empires to run, darling."

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a smile. Even after all this time, his arrogance still amused her.

Her phone buzzed—Victoria Hayes had sent another email. The woman was relentless, always lurking in the shadows with her schemes. Evelyn sighed, tossing the device aside.

"Problem?" Nathan arched a brow.

"Just Victoria being Victoria." She shrugged. "I swear, if she weren’t so good at her job, I’d have fired her years ago."

Nathan chuckled, buttoning his cufflinks. "You’d miss the challenge."

Before she could retort, the doorbell rang. Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-efficient agent, strode in with a stack of contracts.

"Morning, lovebirds," she quipped, dropping the papers onto the coffee table. "Evelyn, we need to discuss the Montgomery project. Harrison’s team is pushing for changes."

Evelyn groaned. "Of course they are."

Nathan leaned against the doorway, watching them with amusement. "Need backup?"

She shot him a look. "I can handle Harrison Montgomery."

His smirk deepened. "I’d pay to see that."

Serena cleared her throat. "Focus, children. We have a meeting in an hour."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, flipping through the contracts. The terms were ridiculous—Harrison wanted creative control, something she’d never relinquish.

"Tell them no," she said firmly. "If Harrison wants this deal, he plays by my rules."

Serena nodded, already typing a response. "I’ll make it clear."

Nathan’s phone buzzed—a message from Marcus Donovan, Julian’s agent. His expression darkened.

"Trouble?" Evelyn asked.

"Julian’s latest stunt made headlines again," he muttered. "The press is having a field day."

Evelyn squeezed his arm. "He’ll grow out of it."

Nathan scoffed. "He’s thirty, Evelyn. When exactly does that happen?"

Before she could answer, her phone rang—Lillian Graves, her assistant, sounding frantic.

"Evelyn, you need to see this. Now."

A link popped up on her screen. The tabloids had gotten hold of an old photo—Nathan and Cassandra, his first love, at a charity gala years ago. The caption was brutal: Blackwood’s Heart Still Belongs to Another?

Evelyn’s stomach twisted, but she forced a laugh. "Oh, please. They’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel now."

Nathan frowned, reading over her shoulder. "I’ll have legal handle this."

She waved him off. "Don’t bother. The world loves drama. Let them have their fun."

But beneath her calm exterior, doubt crept in. Cassandra had always been the one who got away. Did Nathan still think about her?

Serena’s phone chimed. "Evelyn, we need to leave. Now."

Nathan caught Evelyn’s wrist as she turned to go. "Hey." His voice was low, intense. "You know there’s no one else."

She searched his eyes, finding only sincerity. "I know."

But as she walked away, the seed of insecurity lingered.

And Victoria Hayes? She was already plotting her next move.

The moment Daniel stepped outside to shake off the crowd, he immediately texted Nathan about Cassandra's unexpected appearance at the gathering. But to his dismay, the couple had already arrived, forcing him into an awkward greeting.

"Oh, you're here already."

Nathan gave a curt nod while Evelyn flashed a warm smile. "Hello."

Her eyes immediately swept over Daniel with undisguised curiosity.

Wow. He actually brought his girlfriend—who's pregnant out of wedlock! Wait… they haven’t announced it yet? She smirked inwardly. Makes sense. Probably an unplanned pregnancy, and he only found out after returning from that business trip. They’ll probably announce it soon and rush into wedding plans.

Nathan’s gaze darkened as he studied Daniel. He knew the man had been desperate to marry his long-term girlfriend, but she kept putting it off. Now, fate had handed them a double surprise.

Unfazed by their scrutiny, Daniel shifted uncomfortably. "Uh… Nathan, can we talk for a second? Evelyn, mind waiting here?"

Nathan frowned. What’s this about?

Evelyn arched a brow. Seriously? Is he really asking Nathan to accompany him to the bathroom like some scared kid?

Nathan stiffened, speechless. What ridiculous thought just crossed her mind?

Then it hit her. Oh! Maybe the people inside don’t want me there, and he’s warning Nathan beforehand.

Nathan’s expression shifted slightly. That was a possibility—given how disastrous their last encounter had been.

"Just say it," he ordered coldly.

Whatever it was, he had no intention of hiding anything from Evelyn.

Daniel paled. How am I supposed to say this? The last person who tried got a drink thrown in her face by Evelyn.

Forcing a smile, he subtly nudged Nathan, lying through his teeth. "It’s nothing serious… just… could you come with me to the restroom?"

Nathan blinked.

Pfft. Hah! I was joking, but he actually stole my idea. And why does he look so guilty?

Evelyn barely suppressed a laugh. This is too good.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered as she nudged Nathan forward. "You two go ahead. I'll wait right here."

Relief washed over Daniel. She's really changed. So considerate now.

Nathan had no choice but to turn silently and follow Daniel toward the restroom.

Please don’t actually make me go in there with him…

They hadn’t walked far when Daniel leaned in, his voice hushed and nervous. "Listen, I need to warn you—"

Oh god.

A sharp inhale echoed in Nathan’s ear.

Two voices spoke at the same time.

"—your ex, Cassandra, is coming tonight."

His first love is back in the country. And she’s on her way here.

Nathan froze, eyes widening as he glanced at Evelyn from the corner of his vision.

Her pupils trembled slightly, lips parting as if processing the bombshell.

"I’m not worried about you," Daniel muttered. "But her. I don’t think they should meet. While she’s still clueless, you should handle this."

Nathan shot him a dry look. She already knows. Probably better than any of us.

How did I forget? The email even listed her return time. I was too busy with gossip…

Evelyn’s mental voice dripped with frustration.

Nathan’s lips twitched. Finally panicking, huh?

Her thoughts spiraled. I almost missed this golden opportunity! That contract today was a steal. After the divorce, I’ll walk away with two hundred million, Nathan’s investments, and my own agency. Financial freedom—here I come!

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly.

But Evelyn wasn’t done. Ugh, no warning before my windfall? I’m not even dressed for the occasion!

He sucked in a sharp breath.

Then her tone shifted. Wait—no. I should look heartbroken. When he dumps me for Cassandra, the whole family will pity me. I’ve been on my best behavior lately—he might even give me extra out of guilt. Hehe… Time to act my heart out when she arrives.

Act? Nathan’s jaw tightened. Let’s see how convincing you are.


Nathan had initially planned to let Evelyn decide whether to attend the reunion, knowing how much her past self despised Cassandra.

But now, their presence was non-negotiable.

He was determined to show her—right here, right now—that he wouldn’t discard her for some irrelevant woman from his past.

A divorce? Over my dead body.

Ignoring Daniel’s rambling, Nathan strode toward Evelyn.

When Daniel saw Nathan’s expression turn icy, he assumed the man was uncomfortable and might leave with Evelyn to avoid the awkwardness.

To his shock, Nathan wrapped an arm around Evelyn’s waist and guided her forward before she could react.

Even more surprising—they were heading straight into the ballroom.

Daniel blinked. What the hell?

From what he knew, Nathan had zero lingering feelings for Cassandra. When they broke up, Nathan hadn’t even batted an eye. Daniel had often wondered if Nathan had ever truly cared for her.

But now?

Nathan was angry.

Evelyn had just been standing there quietly. So he couldn’t be mad at her.

Was he upset with Cassandra? That made no sense.

Daniel rubbed his temples, utterly baffled, and trailed after them like a lost puppy.

Evelyn had been lost in her daydreams—visions of a bright, unshackled future. For a brief moment, the weight of reality had pressed down on her, making it hard to breathe, but the fantasy quickly swept her back under its glittering tide.

Then, suddenly, she was pulled against a solid chest.

Well, not quite an embrace—more like a firm, guiding hand at the small of her back, propelling her forward with enough force to make her stumble.

"Let’s go." Nathan’s voice was clipped, his gaze fixed ahead.

But Evelyn felt it—the simmering irritation beneath his cool exterior.

Ah. Here it comes.

Nathan ignored her mental commentary. Nothing she thought right now would please him anyway.

Oh, look at him—all worked up because his first love is coming. Can’t even wait for her to arrive before dragging me along like some prop. What’s next? A dramatic declaration of undying love right in front of me?

A vein throbbed violently at Nathan’s temple.

Evelyn’s thoughts grated on. But sweet ex-husband, your precious Cassandra isn’t even here yet. You’re jumping the gun!

Nathan's fury burned so intensely he could taste copper on his tongue. Yet he had no choice but to clench his jaw and endure it.

After their bitter breakup, his first love Eleanor had vanished abroad without a trace. Years later, she was finally returning—a reunion destined to be equal parts agony and ecstasy. Old wounds would reopen, misunderstandings would unravel, and sparks would inevitably reignite! By all accounts, Evelyn should be playing the villainous wife to catalyze their reunion, but risking her alimony for this? Absolutely not.

As Evelyn's thoughts spiraled, Nathan felt as though his soul had been wrenched from his body. His arm around her waist tightened possessively. From Daniel's perspective, Nathan had practically engulfed Evelyn in an embrace so intimate it bordered on scandalous.

Daniel's eyes widened to saucers.

Evelyn herself was too distracted to notice. Her mind raced at breakneck speed, conjuring increasingly dramatic scenarios. Would her soon-to-be ex-husband lose his infamous composure the moment he laid eyes on Eleanor? Would he—

"Ow!" She yelped as Nathan pinched her cheek sharply.

The attendant swung the ballroom doors open just as they arrived.

Every head in the room swiveled toward them.

The sight that greeted the guests was nothing short of astonishing: Nathan Blackwood, the ice-cold tycoon known for his impenetrable demeanor, stood framed in the doorway with one arm locked around Evelyn's waist and the other teasingly pinching her flushed cheek. Their bodies were pressed so close they might as well have been glued together, their playful intimacy radiating like a spotlight.

The crowd froze. Never in living memory had anyone witnessed Nathan display such boyish affection—let alone in public.

This was unprecedented.

###Chapter 183 Have They Been Struck By Lightning

Perhaps it was because Nathan's actions were too unexpected, but the lively ballroom fell into such abrupt silence that one could hear the faintest whisper.

The couple standing at the entrance was both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.

It was reunion day, so Evelyn had dressed up slightly out of courtesy before leaving home.

At that moment, she wore a soft lavender dress with a delicate silver scarf draped around her shoulders. Her figure was perfectly proportioned, and even in such simple attire, she carried herself like a runway model.

Her raven-black hair cascaded in loose waves, each strand catching the light as if woven from silk.

Her minimal makeup only enhanced her natural beauty—rosy lips contrasting with porcelain skin, her curves elegant and refined.

Her wide, crystalline eyes—dark as midnight—were currently rounded in surprise from Nathan's sudden pinch on her cheek, making her look even more endearing.

Her lips parted slightly in a mix of shock and irritation at his boldness.

She was nothing like the woman they had met two years ago. Back then, the shadows clinging to her expression had dulled her radiance.

But now, they finally understood why she had become an artist. With just her face and poise alone, she was more than qualified.

At the main table, those who held no strong bias against Evelyn made quiet comparisons.

In terms of beauty, Evelyn completely outshines Cassandra, from what we remember. And... how should I put it? Is it because she's standing so close to Nathan? They look more compatible side by side than Nathan and Cassandra ever did.

Speaking of Nathan, his piercing dark eyes and striking features were as mesmerizing as ever. His tailored suit accentuated his broad shoulders and lean frame, making him look like a sculpture brought to life.

Even knowing he was taken, many women in the room couldn't help but blush, their gazes lingering on the former campus heartthrob.

The Nathan from their university days had been charming, but the man before them now carried an aura of ruthless authority—an allure that was impossible to resist.

Powerful men had a magnetism that made hearts race. If a woman were to be held by such a man, her knees would surely buckle.

But what captivated them most was the way Nathan was behaving now.

Back in university, even though everyone knew he and Cassandra were together, seeing them side by side had never felt like this.

It was hard to describe.

With Cassandra, Nathan had always been composed—untouchable, like a flawless statue unaffected by anyone around him.

But the Nathan standing beside Evelyn wasn't that same perfect, distant figure.

This subtle change only deepened the fascination of those who had once admired him. It was as if a god had stepped down from his pedestal, igniting a spark of hope in their hearts.

Evelyn's stunning appearance and the couple's intimate interaction planted seeds of doubt in many minds.

Earlier that day, gossip had spread from the main table—Cassandra was expected to arrive.

Cassandra, the woman who had captured the heart of the untouchable Nathan, his first love.

Their breakup had been abrupt—Nathan had been dumped, while Cassandra left for abroad without a word.

Logically, such an unfinished story should have left room for reconciliation. Especially with rumors swirling about the troubles in Nathan's marriage—no wedding ceremony, whispers of discord.

Many had assumed that if Cassandra returned, humbled herself, and made amends, she could easily reclaim her place beside him.

But now, they weren't so sure.

No, no, no! Nathan and Cassandra were together for years. In terms of background and capability, they're perfectly matched. Evelyn is... well, out of her league.

Their thoughts were a tangled mess.

Evelyn, meanwhile, was equally confused. What’s his deal? Not only does he pinch me out of nowhere, but his glare feels like I’ve personally offended him.

“Why did you pinch me?” she demanded.

Finally snapping out of her daze, Nathan released her cheek, his dark eyes flickering as he noticed the faint red mark left behind.

Too hard.

Almost instinctively, his thumb brushed over the spot in a gentle caress.

Seeing her displeased expression, he lied smoothly, “You had something on your face.”

Evelyn narrowed her eyes skeptically.

Fine. I didn’t provoke him, so he probably just didn’t realize his own strength. Still, he nearly dented my cheek! Does he not know how to be gentle with women?

Listening to her sarcastic inner monologue, Nathan’s mood inexplicably lifted.

Just as he loosened his grip, her thoughts took another wild turn. Wait. Is he having a breakdown? Did news of his ex-girlfriend rattle him so much that he’s losing control? Oh no—

Before she could spiral further, he abruptly pulled her into another tight embrace, steering her toward the main table.

Evelyn felt like she was being dragged into uncharted territory. Forcing a polite smile, she followed his lead—only to be met with a sea of stunned faces when they reached the group.

She blinked. What’s with them? Did they all get struck by lightning or something?

Nathan found their reactions equally bizarre.

Before he could speak, Daniel, who had followed them in, cleared his throat pointedly.

No response.

Instead, a woman in a blush-pink dress, who had been sitting with her back to them, suddenly stood and turned around.

Her hair was swept to one side, cascading over her shoulder. Her downcast eyes and delicate posture made her look fragile—instantly invoking protectiveness.

But she seemed flustered, one hand clutching her purse while the other rested protectively over her stomach.

Ignoring Nathan and Evelyn completely, she addressed Daniel in a hurried whisper.

“Daniel, Queenie just called. There’s an issue with our project. I’m worried she can’t handle it alone, so I need to go back. I won’t be able to stay for the reunion.”

Daniel stiffened. He had brought her here to announce their engagement—and the unexpected pregnancy that had accelerated their wedding plans.

Ideally, they should make the announcement together.

But now she was leaving abruptly for work?

Though he respected her dedication, frustration flickered in his chest.

Seeing her anxious expression, however, he relented. “I’ll drive you.”

A brief flash of relief crossed her face before she shook her head. “No, don’t let me ruin your night. I’ll take a cab.”

With that, she excused herself. As she passed Nathan and Evelyn, she offered a quick, apologetic nod before hurrying out.

Despite her refusal, Daniel followed to ensure she got a taxi safely.

The strange interruption finally snapped everyone out of their daze. Slowly, greetings were exchanged as Nathan and Evelyn took their seats.

All eyes remained fixed on the couple—especially Evelyn, who was now the subject of intense scrutiny.

Unfazed, she studied them right back, mentally cataloging each face in her ever-growing gossip database.

###Chapter 184 A Monthly Salary Of Five Hundred Thousand

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred beneath silk sheets. Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand, dragging her from the edges of sleep. She blinked at the screen—Serena Whitmore, 7 missed calls.

Her agent never called this early unless it was urgent.

Evelyn sat up, rubbing her temples. The remnants of last night’s champagne still lingered in her veins, a dull throb behind her eyes. She swiped to answer.

"Finally!" Serena’s voice crackled through the line. "Where have you been? The studio’s in chaos. Nathan Blackwood just pulled out of Midnight Sonata."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "What?"

"Some last-minute conflict with his schedule. Preston Whitmore is furious. They want you to convince him to stay."

Her fingers tightened around the phone. Nathan had been the reason she’d signed onto the project in the first place. Their chemistry during the table read had been electric—enough to make even the jaded crew members pause.

But convincing Nathan Blackwood of anything was like trying to tame a storm.

"I’ll talk to him," she said, though the words tasted bitter.

Serena exhaled in relief. "Good. Because if he walks, the entire production collapses. And Vanessa Sterling’s already circling like a vulture."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. The thought of Vanessa—Harrison Montgomery’s scheming mistress—snatching the role made her blood boil.

She ended the call and tossed the phone aside, her mind racing. Nathan wouldn’t back out without a reason. And if she had to guess, it had everything to do with his family.

The Blackwoods were a tempest of secrets, and Nathan was the eye of the hurricane.

Nathan stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, the city sprawled beneath him like a glittering chessboard. His brother Julian’s text glared up at him from his desk:

Sophia’s in trouble. Again.

His jaw clenched. His sister’s reckless decisions were becoming a pattern—one that threatened to drag the Blackwood name through the mud.

The door creaked open behind him.

"You’re avoiding my calls," Evelyn said, her voice cool.

He didn’t turn. "I’ve been busy."

"Too busy for Midnight Sonata?"

Nathan finally faced her. Evelyn stood in the doorway, arms crossed, her emerald eyes sharp with accusation. She wore a simple black dress, her hair loose around her shoulders. Even angry, she was breathtaking.

"It’s complicated," he said.

She stepped closer, the scent of jasmine trailing her. "Uncomplicate it. The studio’s panicking. Vanessa’s waiting in the wings."

His expression darkened at the mention of Vanessa. "She’ll never get the part."

"Then don’t give her the chance." Evelyn’s voice softened. "What’s really going on, Nathan?"

For a moment, he considered telling her—about Sophia’s latest scandal, about the media vultures circling their family. But the words lodged in his throat.

Evelyn sighed. "Fine. Keep your secrets. But if you walk away from this film, you’re not just letting down Preston. You’re letting down us."

The weight of her words settled between them.

Nathan’s phone buzzed again. Another message from Julian: She’s at the Grand Hyatt. Room 1420.

He pocketed the phone, his decision made. "I’ll be at the studio by noon."

Evelyn studied him, as if trying to decipher the storm behind his eyes. Then, with a nod, she turned to leave.

But Nathan caught her wrist. "Evelyn."

She paused, glancing back.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

A flicker of surprise crossed her face before she pulled free. "Don’t thank me yet. You still have to face Preston."

The door clicked shut behind her.

Nathan exhaled, his grip tightening on his phone.

One crisis at a time.

The air grew thick with tension for a brief moment before the two most cheerful souls at the table broke the silence.

Runes. Have you fur


“We’ve only met a few times, right, Evelyn? Haha… I’m Vivian Grant. Do you remember me?”

Vivian happened to be seated beside Evelyn, her bubbly personality radiating warmth.

Everyone at the table was four to five years older than Evelyn, so Vivian spoke with the playful tone of someone teasing a younger sister.

Yet, Evelyn’s youthful, delicate features made her seem even younger than she was.

Vivian was the quintessential sheltered rich girl—naive, kind-hearted, and adored by everyone. The last time Evelyn had caused a scene and flipped a table, Vivian had nearly been caught in the crossfire, leaving her shaken. That she could still greet Evelyn with such enthusiasm now was a testament to Nathan’s influence and her own curiosity about Evelyn’s dramatic transformation.

“I’m Marcus Prescott, her boyfriend and your husband’s former college roommate.” Marcus wrapped an arm around Vivian’s shoulders, flashing a bright, carefree grin.

Outwardly, he seemed as easygoing as Vivian, but beneath the surface, he carried scars from his birth mother’s early death and the string of stepmothers that followed. Before meeting Vivian, he had been brooding and withdrawn. But one glance at her had changed everything, turning him into one half of their circle’s most infamous lovebirds.

From their college days to now, even weathering a long-distance relationship, their passion had never waned. They were the golden couple—everyone’s favorite pair, universally adored and blessed.

Seeing them together was like a burst of sunshine.

“Hello. I remember you both. Your relationship is still as strong as ever.”

Not bad. Aside from the nuisance of Marcus’s useless father forcing them to return for his latest wedding, this couple had no real worries. They were even discussing marriage plans.

The lovebirds thrived on praise for their relationship, so Evelyn’s words instantly warmed them to her.

Vivian beamed. “You two seem much closer now too.”

Nathan had been quietly listening to Evelyn’s thoughts when Vivian’s comment caught him off guard. A flicker of inexplicable joy sparked inside him.

His expression softened almost imperceptibly.

Others at the table had initially worried Vivian’s remark was too forward. But seeing Nathan’s reaction, they were stunned into silence.

To avoid earning Nathan's displeasure, Vivian had been carefully navigating the conversation—all for the sake of securing that generous alimony.

But Evelyn Sinclair understood her perfectly.

She’s dropping hints… but when Cassandra arrives later, won’t she be mortified realizing her mistake? They used to be so close. With her being so sweet and naive, it’ll be absolutely delicious watching her fluster in a few minutes. Hehe…

Nathan’s thoughts darkened.

Watching Vivian, who remained blissfully unaware, Nathan couldn’t shake the feeling that Evelyn was toying with her—though he had no proof.

Meanwhile, Marcus remembered Cassandra was due to arrive soon. To spare his girlfriend the impending awkwardness, he swiftly changed the subject. "Do you recall everyone else? I can reintroduce you."

Evelyn had already turned her attention to the others—there wasn’t much drama to be had with the couple in front of her.

"I don’t need introductions. I can manage," she said smoothly.

"It’s been a while. I’m Lucas Thornton."

The first to greet her was a refined gentleman in glasses. His expression was pleasant, his demeanor polished, but his gaze was unreadable. He sat beside Marcus, the only bachelor at the table.

Yet the moment Evelyn acknowledged him, her attention snapped to the woman seated diagonally across—a poised, elegant figure adorned with stunning yet understated jewelry.

The woman blinked in surprise, clearly caught off guard by the sudden scrutiny.

Lucas shifted slightly in his seat at the unexpected reaction.

"You remember Beatrice? Ah, right—you must’ve heard she’s about to become Lucas’s cousin-in-law. That’s why you looked at her, isn’t it? We’ll all be attending their wedding soon," Vivian said with a laugh.

Nathan recalled Evelyn’s earlier revelation—a man whose unrequited love is about to marry his cousin.

And speaking of cousins… Lucas’s cousin was indeed getting married. The bride? Their mutual friend, Beatrice Holloway.

Though they moved in the same circles, their relationships varied in closeness. Even back in university, Lucas and Beatrice had barely exchanged words one-on-one. After graduation, they only met at group gatherings—never privately.

So even after piecing it together, Nathan couldn’t be entirely sure.

Not until Evelyn’s thoughts echoed in his mind.

Holy hell. This is insane. Lucas has been secretly in love with Beatrice for nearly a decade, and yet in her eyes, they’re practically strangers. Worse—everyone in their circle thinks the same. Their so-called connection? Just a coincidence thanks to this arranged marriage. My God. Is Lucas some kind of undercover agent?

Shock flooded Nathan's system like a tidal wave.


So it's actually true! Nathan's mind raced. How could I have missed this for over ten years? And has everyone else been blind too? His thoughts spiraled. Why has Lucas been pining for Beatrice all this time without ever confessing?

Just then, Evelyn's internal monologue cut through his thoughts. Oh… So that's it? Her realization dripped with amusement. Good grief… I don't even know what to say. Well, let him watch the woman he loves marry someone else, then.

No, don't just leave it at that! Nathan nearly groaned aloud, his curiosity burning. What's the real reason?

For once, the usually composed Nathan Blackwood was desperate for gossip.

Both Lucas and Beatrice exchanged puzzled glances as Evelyn's gaze lingered on them, her expression unreadable yet undeniably strange.

Before they could question her, however, Evelyn's attention snapped elsewhere—someone had called her name.

"Hey, remember me?" Grayson Hart arched a brow, his tone hovering between casual and guarded. Evelyn had once torn into him, and clearly, the sting hadn’t entirely faded.

He half-expected her to falter under his scrutiny, to show even a flicker of discomfort.

Instead, Evelyn barely spared him a glance before zeroing in on the woman beside him.

Her intrigued inspection set him off instantly.

"What are you staring at?" Grayson demanded.

"Who’s this?" Evelyn asked, genuine curiosity lacing her voice.

"Gwendolyn Brooks," Grayson replied, deliberately omitting any mention of their relationship. He nudged the woman sharply, signaling her to greet Evelyn.

The atmosphere shifted immediately. Nathan, unable to resist, glanced over—and instantly understood what Evelyn had been mentally dissecting earlier.

Gwendolyn was young, but her makeup was oddly deliberate, as if she’d carefully crafted her appearance to resemble someone specific.

Evelyn’s thoughts spilled into Nathan’s mind again. Ohhh, so she’s the stand-in for his first love? Her amusement was palpable. Holy hell—a monthly salary of five hundred thousand? That’s… actually a pretty sweet gig! Wait—what? A burst of laughter echoed in her mind. Grayson actually thinks she’s taking the money to hide her real feelings for him because of their agreement! He forbade her from falling in love with him! Where the hell does he get this confidence? Pfft! Little does he know she’s almost saved up enough—she’s planning to ditch him after this month’s paycheck!

Nathan barely suppressed a smirk.


###Chapter 185 Every Man Has His Own Kryptonite

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She traced her fingers over the bold title of her latest project—Whispers of the Heart—a role that could redefine her career.

Her phone buzzed, breaking the silence.

Lillian Graves (Assistant): "Evelyn, Preston Whitmore just called. The studio wants to fast-track production. They’re moving the table read to tomorrow."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Tomorrow? She had barely  annotating her script.

Before she could respond, another message flashed.

Nathan Blackwood: "Breakfast at The Velvet Rose? I have news."

Her lips curved into a smile. Nathan’s texts always carried an air of mystery, but this one felt different.

The Velvet Rose was an upscale café tucked between high-rises, its marble countertops gleaming under delicate chandeliers. Nathan sat at their usual corner booth, his sharp jawline accentuated by the morning light.

"You’re early," Evelyn teased, sliding into the seat across from him.

Nathan smirked, pushing a steaming cup of lavender latte toward her. "When have I ever kept you waiting?"

She took a sip, the floral notes calming her nerves. "So, what’s this news?"

His expression turned serious. "Vincent Holloway is backing out of Whispers."

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. "What? He’s the lead investor!"

"Not anymore." Nathan leaned in, his voice low. "Rumor has it, he’s diverting funds to that indie film Seraphina Delacroix is producing."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup. Seraphina—her longtime rival—had a knack for sabotaging her projects.

"But," Nathan continued, a sly glint in his eyes, "I might have a solution."

She arched a brow. "Do tell."

"Sebastian Hart."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Sebastian was A-list, notoriously selective, and—most importantly—untouchable by Seraphina’s schemes.

"You think he’d consider it?" she asked.

Nathan’s lips quirked. "He already has. We met last night."

Evelyn’s heart raced. This changed everything.

Back at her penthouse, Evelyn paced, her mind whirling. If Sebastian signed on, the studio wouldn’t dare delay production. But why would he agree so quickly?

Her phone rang—Preston Whitmore.

"Evelyn," his voice was tense. "We need you on set in two hours. Donovan Sharpe is pushing for reshoots on the finale."

Her stomach dropped. "That’s impossible. We wrapped last week!"

"Not according to the new edits." A pause. "And… Seraphina’s here. She’s suggesting… revisions to your character’s arc."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

This wasn’t just about Whispers anymore.

This was war.

"Nice to meet you," Gwendolyn Brooks greeted, her bedroom eyes lighting up momentarily as they met Evelyn Sinclair's gaze. Her voice lifted briefly before she caught herself, smoothing her expression into practiced professionalism.

Those hypnotic eyes—deep pools of liquid warmth—were identical to Vivian Moore's, Grayson Hart's first love and ex-girlfriend.

From Evelyn's perspective, the gossip about Grayson hiring a lookalike substitute for his unrequited crush suddenly made tragicomical sense.

There was just one hiccup.

Oh, this college girl is actually my fan. Not bad—she’s got taste. Evelyn smirked internally. No wonder she looked so starstruck earlier. If she weren’t on duty, she’d probably be scrambling for a selfie right now.

On duty…

Nathan Blackwood resisted the urge to facepalm.

When Evelyn had casually exposed Damien’s scandals earlier, her revelations felt frustratingly sparse. But now? He’d give anything to unhear this.

What kind of deranged idiot hires a college student as a living memorial to his ex? Nathan cringed inwardly. Though, given how that breakup went down, maybe I shouldn’t be surprised…

Evelyn’s mental commentary continued unabated: Hah! Turns out Vivian dumped him for the simplest reason—she got bored. Long-distance was exhausting, her feelings fizzled, and she wanted to ‘explore new horizons’ (read: date foreign guys). So she publicly broke it off to avoid cheating allegations. Cold-blooded efficiency!

Nathan’s lips twitched. Vivian did always play by her own rules. Last I checked, she’s on boyfriend number three in Barcelona. Even I’ve accidentally seen her tan-line photos on Instagram.

I’d pay to see Grayson’s face when she walked away, Evelyn mused.

Nathan mentally replayed the scene: Oh, it was priceless. Dude tried to salvage his pride by threatening, ‘You’ll regret this!’ like some rejected Disney villain.

And Vivian? Evelyn’s inner voice dripped with glee. She blew him a kiss and told him to ‘stay mad, sweetheart’ before strutting off.

Worst part? Nathan added silently. He held out hope until her new boyfriend’s yacht pics went viral.

Evelyn’s imaginary popcorn munching grew louder. Then he hired Mini-Vivian here? Pathetic. Though… Her gaze flicked to Gwendolyn’s expertly neutral smile. This girl’s clearly smarter than she looks. Watch her turn this into a paid acting gig.

Nathan choked on his drink. God, she’s right. That’s exactly what—

"Another whiskey, Mr. Blackwood?" Gwendolyn asked sweetly, already reaching for his glass.

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled with mischief. Called it.

Did Grayson truly believe that Vivian, who had walked away from him by choice, would still care?

For some inexplicable reason, I couldn’t help but pity Grayson…

Truth be told, Nathan was taken aback. Grayson had once been the epitome of a playboy, cycling through girlfriends like seasons. Each time, it was the women who fell hopelessly for him. Even after his breakup with Vivian, he’d indulged in his usual escapades. Yet, against all odds, he still couldn’t erase her from his heart.

Was this what they meant when they said every man had his own kryptonite? Evelyn mused silently.

Nathan agreed wordlessly. You hit the nail on the head…

Evelyn’s thoughts spiraled further. During a chance encounter with Gwendolyn, who was job-hunting, Grayson had the audacity to hire her as a stand-in for Vivian. He claimed to love Vivian but couldn’t tolerate her fiery temperament. So, he’d instructed Gwendolyn to study Vivian’s mannerisms and speech—yet demanded she embody a docile, obedient version of her.

Nathan’s brows knitted slightly, his gaze flickering with disdain toward his so-called friend. This behavior is beyond questionable.

Evelyn scoffed inwardly. This man is living in pure delusion. Since he can’t have the perfect woman, he’s decided to mold someone into his ideal?

Quietly, Nathan exhaled in relief. Thankfully, Gwendolyn seems to have no ulterior motives, and this arrangement is mutually beneficial. Otherwise, this would’ve been a disaster waiting to happen.

Suddenly, realization struck Evelyn. Ah, I see now! He doesn’t even consider Gwendolyn a girlfriend, yet he brought her to this event. He’s playing mind games—hoping Vivian, who’s overseas, will catch wind of this. Seriously, Grayson, do you really think using Gwendolyn as bait will lure Vivian back? So the two women can fight over you?

Nathan blinked. Huh?

How utterly childish. Even so, it depended on whether they were willing to play along. I can’t speak for Vivian, but Gwendolyn is about to resign, you know? Ha! His arrogance is his downfall. I’d pay to see his face when Gwendolyn quits and Vivian doesn’t come running back.

Evelyn’s mind raced with gossip, her lips twitching as she struggled to suppress a smirk.

Watching Grayson strut around as if Gwendolyn were his property, it took every ounce of her self-control not to burst out laughing.

Beside her, Nathan could feel her trembling with suppressed amusement.

He wanted to bury his face in his hands, mortified on Grayson’s behalf. Evelyn had seen right through his pathetic scheme.

Because even after Gwendolyn had greeted her, Evelyn kept darting glances between them, her expression brimming with barely contained excitement. Grayson’s skin prickled under her scrutiny.

“Why are you staring like that?” He shifted uncomfortably under her intense gaze.

Evelyn smiled sweetly. “I’ve never seen such a stunning young woman before. I couldn’t help but admire her a little longer.”

When Gwendolyn heard her idol complimenting her, her eyes sparkled instantly. "Ms. Sinclair, you're the one who—"

Before she could finish, Grayson—who had unmistakably detected the excitement in her tone, completely at odds with the demeanor he'd demanded—abruptly raised his hand and yanked her into his arms, displeasure written across his face. His glare was sharp enough to cut glass.

Couldn't she see I despise Evelyn? Why the hell is she being so friendly?

For a heartbeat, Gwendolyn froze. But then, like a well-trained actress slipping into character, she melted against him, playing the part of the doting, lovesick woman flawlessly.

Grayson smirked, his voice dripping with condescension. "Evelyn, your taste has always been questionable. What's so special about her? If she hadn’t clung to me like a desperate leech, acting like she’d die without me, I’d never have let her be my date. Isn’t that right?"

He arched a brow, staring pointedly at Gwendolyn, silently demanding she back him up.

With a shy, awkward nod, she played along, embodying the shameless pursuer to perfection.

Inside, though, she was seething. Hang in there. Just endure it for the sake of half a million. I’m not Gwendolyn anymore—I’m Vivian 2.0. Even if my boss is an insufferable jerk, it’s just part of the job. Stay professional. The orphanage renovations are almost funded.

Grayson, meanwhile, was absurdly pleased with her performance. A part of him even wondered if there was a shred of truth in it. Sure, his words might’ve stung, but pain was a good teacher—one that would remind her of her place.

Across from them, Evelyn’s hand had slipped to her thigh, nails digging in to keep herself from bursting into laughter.

Don’t laugh. Don’t you dare laugh. Grayson, oh Grayson, is this really how you think Vivian acted? You want her to be obsessed with you while you play the indifferent tycoon? Pathetic. The harder you try, the more pitiful you look. Then again, in your own twisted way, you’re almost romantic.

###Chapter 186 That Is Disgusting

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the Blackwood estate, she felt the weight of unspoken tension pressing against her chest. The grand chandelier cast flickering shadows across the marble floor, mirroring the storm brewing in her heart.

Nathan Blackwood stood by the fireplace, his broad shoulders rigid, his piercing gaze locked onto her. "You're late," he remarked, his voice a low rumble that sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn lifted her chin, refusing to be intimidated. "Traffic was worse than expected."

A sardonic smile tugged at his lips. "Always an excuse with you."

Before she could retort, Victoria Hayes sauntered in, her designer heels clicking sharply against the floor. "Oh, don’t mind me," she purred, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I just came to remind Nathan about the board meeting tomorrow."

Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. Victoria had a knack for appearing at the worst possible moments, her presence like a dark cloud looming over them.

Nathan barely spared her a glance. "Noted."

Victoria's smile faltered, but she recovered quickly, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "Well, I’ll leave you two to… whatever this is." She shot Evelyn a knowing look before strutting out, the scent of her expensive perfume lingering in the air.

The silence that followed was suffocating.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "We need to talk."

Nathan crossed his arms. "About?"

"About us," she insisted. "About whatever this"—she gestured between them—"is supposed to be."

His expression darkened. "There is no us, Evelyn. Not anymore."

The words struck like a physical blow, but she refused to back down. "You don’t mean that."

"Don’t I?" He took a step closer, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. "You walked away first. Don’t act surprised now."

Her breath hitched. "I had my reasons."

"Reasons you never bothered to share." His voice was laced with bitterness.

Evelyn swallowed hard. The truth hovered on the tip of her tongue, but fear kept it locked inside. What if he never forgave her? What if this was the end?

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Serena Whitmore, her agent: "Emergency meeting. Now."

She hesitated, torn between staying and leaving.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Go. Duty calls, right?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to argue, but the cold dismissal in his eyes stopped her. With a heavy heart, she turned and walked away, the echo of her footsteps a painful reminder of the distance between them.

Outside, the sky had darkened, thick clouds rolling in as if mirroring her turmoil. She barely registered the first drops of rain as they splashed against her skin.

Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbled—a warning of the storm to come.

And Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.

Nathan averted his gaze, unable to stomach the scene any longer.

But the others misinterpreted the situation entirely. How could they possibly understand the depth of Grayson’s devotion? They assumed the woman who had caught his eye was just another gold-digger who bore an uncanny resemblance to Vivian. To them, Gwendolyn was nothing more than a cheap imitation, desperate to win Grayson’s favor by mimicking his ex. Naturally, the disdain in the room was palpable.

From the way Grayson spoke to her, it was obvious he was merely toying with her—she wasn’t his girlfriend, just another passing amusement. And so, the people at the table grew impatient, unwilling to waste their time on someone so beneath them.

At the center of it all sat Mason Hunter. Dressed in a tailored suit, his fingers adorned with rare auction pieces, he lounged back in his chair with practiced arrogance. His dark hair was slicked back, his sharp features exuding a feral charm. He had a habit of tilting his head just slightly, looking down at others as if they were nothing more than insects beneath his polished shoes.

"Grayson," Mason drawled, swirling his drink lazily. "Have your fun, but don’t get attached. Women like her only care about money. They’d sell their souls for the right price." His smirk was cruel. "Don’t let a pretty face fool you."

The words were meant to cut, but Evelyn only found them amusing.

Hmm… Well, he’s not wrong. Who doesn’t work for money? She glanced at Gwendolyn, who remained unfazed, as if Mason’s insults didn’t even register. Interesting. She’s either very good at hiding her emotions, or she genuinely doesn’t care.

Nathan, however, was suffering from secondhand embarrassment so severe it was becoming a medical condition.

Mason had directed his venom at Gwendolyn, but the one who flinched wasn’t her—it was Claire, standing stiffly beside him. Her face darkened, her fingers tightening around her glass. The others who knew the truth exchanged uneasy glances.

When Mason , his gaze flicked to Claire, smug.

Ah. Evelyn’s eyes gleamed with realization. So this wasn’t about Gwendolyn at all. This was a veiled attack on Claire. How messy. She smirked. Does Mason really not realize he’s the one who cheated first?

Nathan nearly choked on his drink.

The last piece of gossip Evelyn had mentioned earlier suddenly clicked into place.

Ex-girlfriend turned sister-in-law. A broken relationship being mended.

Had Mason and Claire dated before? And now he was trying to win her back—while she was married to his own brother?

Nathan’s mind reeled. His memories were a tangled mess.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was thoroughly entertained.

This is even better than I imagined.

Evelyn Sinclair's thoughts swirled as she pieced together the scandalous past. At first, the trio had carried on a clandestine affair, hidden from prying eyes. Given Mason Hunter's guarded nature, his willingness to keep things under wraps spoke volumes about his feelings for Claire Morgan. Yet Claire remained hesitant—marriage meant risking her family's hard-won status. She knew Mason, though wealthy, would never inherit the Hampton empire. He was destined to remain the charming but powerless second son.

So Claire made her choice. She used Mason's connections to weave herself into Ethan Carter's orbit. By the time Mason uncovered the betrayal, the marriage alliance between the Hamptons and the Morgans was already sealed.

Cough, cough. Evelyn wrinkled her nose. I definitely didn’t sign up for this tawdry family drama.

Nathan Blackwood’s jaw tightened. Neither did I. No wonder Mason had been so volatile back then—lashing out at gold-diggers, drowning in bitterness. He’d never imagined the truth was this sordid.

Ethan, Mason’s older brother, was one of Nathan’s most trusted business partners. And from what Nathan could tell, Ethan remained blissfully unaware of his wife’s history.

The tension between Mason and Clifford—no, Grayson Hart—was palpable. Nathan’s instincts prickled. These unresolved emotions were a powder keg waiting to explode.

Then Evelyn turned to him, her gaze unreadable.

You’re all such tragic figures, she mused silently. Apart from Daniel Wright and Marcus Prescott, the rest of you… hopelessly pining after what you can’t have. Tall, rich, devastatingly handsome—yet cursed in love.

Nathan’s fingers twitched. I’m nothing like them.

But the thought twisted into something sharper: Or maybe I am.

The realization hit him like a physical blow. His ears burned. Before he could stop himself, his hand moved toward hers—

Huh? Evelyn’s mental yank snapped him back to reality.

The conversation had shifted to Mason’s current girlfriend, Violet Carter.

Wait, Mason’s seeing someone?

Now Nathan understood Mason’s earlier jabs at Grayson. Even among friends, neither man would yield. Grayson had indeed bought his way into certain circles, but admitting it? Never. The accusation clearly stung, but one look at Mason’s stormy expression told Grayson everything.

With a smirk, Grayson poured gasoline on the fire. "Oh, absolutely. We all know you’ve moved on—what was her name again? The makeup artist?"

Mason’s glass hit the table with a clink. "Careful, Hart."

Evelyn exhaled. Men.

Nathan caught her eye again. This time, her silent laugh was almost fond.

Almost.

His chest ached.

The air was thick with tension as Mason Hunter shifted uncomfortably in his seat. His friends' probing gazes made his skin prickle.

"So, Mason," Vivian Grant drawled, swirling her wine glass with a smirk. "Still playing the pauper with your little makeup artist? What’s the matter—couldn’t bring her tonight because she’s working?"

A hush fell over the group. Claire Morgan’s fingers tightened around her champagne flute, her expression unreadable.

Mason’s jaw twitched, but he forced a careless shrug. "She had a last-minute shoot. Otherwise, she’d be here."

Marcus Prescott barked a laugh. "Seriously? You’re letting her work instead of dragging her to a Hampton event? Since when do you tolerate that?"

Daniel Wright, who had just returned, slung an arm around Marcus’s neck in a mock chokehold. "Talking shit about me again?"

The table erupted into laughter, but the underlying tension remained. No one at this table truly cared about Daniel’s ex-fiancée—she was an outsider, after all. Their interactions with her had always been perfunctory, a courtesy extended only because of Daniel’s stubborn insistence on dating outside their circle.

Vivian leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "Looks like Mason’s gone soft, just like you, Daniel."

Daniel blinked. "What?"

Lucas Thornton cut in, his tone sharp. "Let me guess—you still haven’t told her who you really are. Playing with fire, Hunter."

Beatrice Holloway, usually composed, arched a brow. "You’re lying to her?"

Lucas grinned, eager to stir the pot. "Oh, he’s not just lying—he’s been letting her pay his bills for two years. Testing her ‘sincerity.’"

Beatrice’s lips curled in disgust. "That’s vile."

Grayson Hart scoffed. "Worse—he plans to keep it up. That girl must be delusional to believe this act."

Mason’s face darkened, but pride kept his voice steady. "You don’t understand. She fell for me, not my name or money. I gave her a chance because she was genuine. And she’s proven herself—so unless something changes, she’ll be the one I marry." He smirked, arrogance dripping from his words. "Sure, she’s supported me for two years, but I’ll repay her tenfold. A life of luxury she could never dream of on her own."

The table fell silent.

For once, Mason Hunter sounded deadly serious.

"Are you serious? Do you truly love her?" Vivian Grant questioned with wide, curious eyes.

Mason Hunter hesitated for a brief moment before nodding, a flicker of tenderness passing through his gaze.

Claire Morgan lowered her lashes, pressing her lips together as her fingers tightened around her phone.

Daniel Wright frowned, his voice edged with disapproval. "Playing with someone's emotions like this... it's cruel. If she's as wonderful as you claim, she won't recover easily when the truth comes out. You should come clean now, apologize, and beg for her forgiveness. Otherwise—"

Mason cut him off sharply, his tone laced with desperation. "She won’t leave. You don’t understand how much she loves me, how much she needs me."

Lucas Thornton smirked, crossing his arms. "Oh, that sounds familiar. Mr. Hart said the exact same thing earlier."

Grayson Hart shot him a warning glare.

Throughout the exchange, Nathan Blackwood had been silently observing, his expression darkening as the conversation unfolded.

Is this really just a coincidence?

He turned slightly, catching the shift in Evelyn Sinclair's expression—her face had gone pale, her lips parted in shock.

And just as he expected, her thoughts spilled out in a furious, unguarded rush.

What the actual hell?! That’s vile! Violet Carter’s secret lover is Mason Hunter? This is some twisted Cinderella story gone wrong! Does Mason have any idea how much Violet suffers because of him? Is he out of his damn mind? After what Claire did to him, he turns around and does this to someone else? If he’s got a problem, he should take it up with the one who betrayed him—Claire! Wait… what has she even done? Oh my god… this is going to explode today.

Meanwhile, in a private lounge on the same floor—reserved for guests to freshen up—Cassandra arrived with her entourage.

Inside, two makeup artists stood ready, their kits open and waiting.

###Chapter 187

The tension in the penthouse was so thick it could be sliced with a knife. Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers clenched around the stem of her wineglass. The city lights twinkled below, but her mind was far from the glittering skyline.

Nathan Blackwood leaned against the marble counter, his piercing gaze locked onto her. "You're not seriously considering his offer, are you?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, swirling the deep red liquid in her glass. "It's not that simple, Nathan. Preston Whitmore has connections—resources we don't."

A muscle in Nathan's jaw twitched. "And what exactly does he want in return?"

She hesitated, her nails digging into her palm. That was the question she'd been avoiding. Preston had been vague, dropping hints about "mutual benefits" and "shared interests," but she wasn't naive. Men like him didn't do favors without expecting something—usually something she wasn't willing to give.

Victoria Hayes chose that moment to saunter in, her designer heels clicking against the hardwood. "Well, well. If it isn't the power couple of the hour." Her smirk was razor-sharp. "Rumor has it you two are on the verge of a very public meltdown."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Get out, Victoria."

She laughed, unfazed. "Oh, don't be so dramatic. I’m just here to deliver a message." She pulled out an envelope and slid it across the counter toward Evelyn. "Preston wants your answer by midnight. Tick-tock."

Evelyn's stomach twisted as she picked it up. Inside was a single keycard—to a luxury hotel suite.

Nathan snatched it from her hand before she could react. "Over my dead body."

Victoria arched a brow. "Careful, Blackwood. You're not the only one with influence in this city."

Evelyn stepped between them before things escalated. "Enough. Victoria, tell Preston I'll meet him—but on my terms."

Nathan's grip on her arm was almost painful. "Evelyn—"

She met his gaze, her voice low but firm. "Trust me."

But as Victoria disappeared with a satisfied smirk, Evelyn wondered if she was making a mistake. Because Preston Whitmore wasn’t just offering a deal—he was playing a game.

And she had just become his newest pawn.

###Chapter 188 What Is She Doing


Nathan's declaration hit like a thunderclap, silencing the room.

Even Evelyn froze, her pulse stuttering.

Good Lord, has he lost his mind? she screamed internally. Since when does he spout such nonsense?

Nathan's lips curved with amusement.

His goal? To rattle the infuriating Evelyn—just a little.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. Since when does Nathan have the patience for petty revenge?

With a lazy shrug, Nathan thought, It’s not nonsense. I mean every word.

Initially, Evelyn’s restlessness and the chaos she’d caused had delayed their wedding indefinitely.

But now? The image of her in white sent an unexpected thrill through him.

Before Evelyn could process further, the eerie quiet registered. Her tablemates gaped, transfixed by something behind Nathan.

She didn’t need to turn.

Tsk. Of course. I’m being used.

Nathan blinked at her reaction.

Evelyn’s mind raced. He must’ve spotted Cassandra arriving. That’s why he dropped that sickeningly sweet "Eve" and those cringe-worthy lines—just to provoke his precious first love. Master manipulator indeed.

Nathan nearly choked. What twisted logic is this? But—Wait. Is Cassandra here?

Evelyn sighed. Suddenly, I envy Gwendolyn. At least she gets paid to torment her ex. Me? Just an unpaid prop. If Nathan skimps on alimony post-divorce, he’s officially a heartless miser.

Nathan’s jaw clenched. I’m picturing our wedding, and you’re drafting divorce papers?

He almost laughed aloud. Navigating Evelyn’s imagination was more exhausting than corporate mergers. How does she concoct these scenarios?

Evelyn squared her shoulders. Fine. Let’s see this legendary "first love."

Though she’d seen photos, meeting Cassandra in person was different.

Following the crowd’s stares, she turned—

Wow. She’s stunning.

And—Wait, are those tears? How… predictable.

She fought to maintain her composure, pretending indifference. But he...

Nathan caught himself mid-thought. There is no "he" anymore.



Without hesitation, Nathan turned away. Tonight, he would prove once and for all that his past with Cassandra was just that—history. No lingering emotions, no un business.

When he turned back, his gaze collided with Evelyn’s.

Nathan froze. It had been years since he’d last seen her, and for a fleeting moment, she felt like a stranger.

But the expression on Evelyn’s face? That was unforgettable.

The last time they’d parted, she had looked exactly like this—pale as moonlight, eyes brimming with shattered dreams and unshed tears. Fragile, like a willow branch trembling in a storm.

Back then, Nathan had thought, She’s clearly devastated, yet she still insists on ending things. Her mind’s made up. No point in fighting it. All I can do is wish her well.

So they’d gone their separate ways. No calls. No messages. No chance encounters.

Until now.

A realization struck him like lightning.

She wouldn’t show up to a reunion looking like this. Unless…

Unless his words had cut deeper than he intended.

Unless, all those years ago, that broken expression had been a silent plea for him to ask her to stay.

Nathan, who had accepted their breakup with a polite nod and a hollow wish for her happiness, suddenly felt like a fool.

Evelyn smirked internally. That look on his face—priceless.

Nathan blinked. Why are you pitying me?

Evelyn’s thoughts raced. Violet’s makeup skills are next-level.

Nathan’s jaw nearly dropped.

Evelyn continued, The perfect "wronged woman" façade. Men would never suspect. Women might notice if they looked closely, but Violet’s work is flawless.

Nathan’s eyes narrowed as he studied Cassandra. I’m a man. Of course I wouldn’t see it at first glance.

But that didn’t stop him from falling into his usual trap—overthinking.

Was it all an act? A performance?

Cassandra noticed Nathan’s intense scrutiny and inwardly preened. She let her lashes flutter, her shoulders slump—the picture of wounded vulnerability. As if rooted to the spot, she hesitated, too fragile to take another step.

Perfect.


Evelyn's mind raced. So it was Adrian who found the makeup artist for Cassandra, helping not just her but me too? She'd killed two birds with one stone by targeting Nathan and Mason specifically!

Nathan's jaw tightened. Mason might be clueless, but one thing's certain—I'm no fool.

The silence stretched, thick with tension. Every guest held their breath, eyes darting between the trio like spectators at a tennis match.

This is better than reality TV, someone at the neighboring table whispered. A man reunites with his first love at a reunion while his wife watches, right after he's vowed eternal devotion. The emotional whiplash must be brutal.

Evelyn bit back a smirk. Who knew I'd become the main attraction? Though she couldn't fully enjoy the drama unfolding, she'd gladly take front-row seats. Come on, show me those reactions already!

Nathan's fingers twitched against his glass. Is this really how little my wife values our marriage?

Enough was enough. He wouldn't indulge Evelyn's games tonight.

His gaze swept past Cassandra with deliberate neutrality—no cold dismissal, no warm recognition. Just the polite nod one might give a distant colleague. The same detached courtesy extended to the forgotten figure behind Cassandra: Lillian Jenner, Cassandra's ever-present shadow from their school days.

Now Lillian glared daggers at Nathan, her lips pressed into a thin line.

The crowd deflated like a punctured balloon. That's it? Disappointment hung heavy in the air. No tearful reunion? No explosive confrontation?

Evelyn's sidelong glance at Nathan turned incredulous. That's all the reaction his first love gets? Either he was an Oscar-worthy actor or—

Or he genuinely doesn't care.

Nathan resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Let Evelyn spin her theories; the truth was simpler. Some Chapters were meant to stay closed.

A flicker of hurt crossed Cassandra's face before vanishing. She knew Nathan better than most—his restraint wasn't pretense, just his nature. Expecting grand gestures from him was like waiting for rain in the desert.


The longer someone managed to maintain a harmonious bond with Nathan, the more they earned his affection.

Even though Nathan was a married man who took his vows seriously, Cassandra refused to lose hope. After all, she had been the woman who stood by his side the longest.

Having left once before, she was convinced she held a special place in Nathan’s heart.

Determined, Cassandra was ready to reclaim what she believed was hers.

At that moment, she exchanged a glance with Claire.

Claire immediately spoke up. "Cassandra, Lily, welcome back! I didn’t think you’d make it in time for the reunion, but here you are."

Claire started to rise, then hesitated, casting an awkward look at Evelyn before adding carefully, "Our table is the only one with empty seats. Everyone else is..."

"What’s the big deal?" Grayson cut in bluntly. "We’ve known each other forever. Would you rather sit with strangers?"

Mason seized the opportunity to stir the pot. "Exactly. Anyone here got a problem with that?"

Though the atmosphere grew tense, the group quickly waved off any objections, plastering on smiles.

Truthfully, everyone wanted Cassandra to join them. No one wanted to miss the drama unfolding.

Yet Cassandra herself seemed reluctant, scanning the room for another seat—until Lily dragged her forward.

"We’re sitting here," Lily declared, shooting Evelyn a challenging glare. "And I’d like to see anyone try to stop us."

Nervous glances darted toward Evelyn, fearing a repeat of past outbursts.

But Evelyn’s reaction was… nonexistent.

Cassandra’s gaze swept over her. After hearing Victoria’s endless descriptions of Evelyn as foolish, clumsy, and volatile, she couldn’t hide her disdain. But when their eyes met, she froze.

Evelyn’s expression was utterly serene—even expectant—as if she were watching a play.

What is she up to? Cassandra’s confidence wavered. Didn’t Claire say just mentioning my name would set her off?

She had expected Evelyn to explode the moment Nathan so much as glanced her way, causing a scene that would humiliate her in front of everyone.

But Evelyn just… smiled.

And that unsettled Cassandra more than any tantrum ever could.

This clever maneuver allowed Cassandra to paint herself as the blameless victim, while Evelyn Sinclair stood condemned as the woman utterly unworthy of Nathan Blackwood's affection.

Yet Evelyn's unexpected composure in the face of these accusations left Cassandra seething with frustration. The reaction she'd anticipated—tears, public humiliation, perhaps even a dramatic confrontation—never materialized.

But Cassandra wasn't defeated yet. Nestled in her designer clutch lay the ultimate weapon—that reckless email Evelyn had sent weeks ago. One press of a button, and the carefully crafted message would detonate across social media like a digital grenade, shredding Evelyn's reputation beyond repair.

A smirk curled Cassandra's perfectly glossed lips as she tapped her phone screen. Perhaps I won't even need to lift a finger. This foolish girl has already handed me the knife to slit her own throat.

###Chapter 189 Nathan Is A Rebound

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, scrolling through her phone absentmindedly—until a particular headline made her nearly choke on her drink.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. Again? She exhaled sharply, forcing herself to stay calm. But then—her mind buzzed.

A whisper of thought, sharp and unmistakable, slithered into her consciousness.

"If only they knew the truth—that Nathan was just meeting his sister Sophia for brunch. But let the tabloids speculate. The more they focus on fake scandals, the less they dig into my secrets."

Evelyn froze. That wasn’t her thought.

She blinked, glancing around the empty room. No one was there. Yet the voice—smug, feminine—lingered like perfume.

Then it clicked.

Victoria Hayes.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, had mentioned Victoria’s lunch meeting at the same hotel. And now, somehow, Evelyn was hearing her private musings.

A slow smirk curled her lips.

Oh, this could be fun.

She focused harder, tuning into the mental frequency like adjusting a radio.

"Honestly, if Evelyn knew half the things I’ve done to sabotage her meetings with Preston Whitmore, she’d fire me on the spot. But she’s too trusting. Too naïve."

Evelyn’s teacup clattered against the saucer.

Sabotage?

Her pulse spiked. All those canceled appointments, the "miscommunications" with the director—Victoria had orchestrated them?

Another thought slithered in, dripping with disdain.

"And Nathan? Please. He’s only with her for the PR boost. Once his family approves of his real choice—Margaret’s favorite, Cassandra—Evelyn will be yesterday’s news."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

Cassandra?

A memory flashed—Nathan’s guarded expression when his childhood friend’s name came up. Now it made sense.

But before she could dissect further, the connection snapped. The mental static cleared, leaving only the hum of the air conditioner.

Evelyn leaned back, mind racing.

She had a new advantage. And if Victoria thought she was playing chess while Evelyn played checkers?

Time to flip the board.

The moment Evelyn and Cassandra took their seats, the entire table braced for tension. Everyone held their breath, anticipating an explosive confrontation.

Eavesdroppers from nearby tables leaned in discreetly, hungry for drama.

But to their disappointment, neither Nathan nor Evelyn reacted as expected. It was as if Cassandra’s presence meant nothing—just another face in the crowd.

Yet, the silence felt ominous. Like the eerie stillness before a storm.

No one at the table spoke, the air thick with unspoken tension. Some guests secretly relished the discomfort, hoping for chaos. Others fidgeted, unsure how to break the ice. Should they continue discussing Nathan’s wedding plans? Or acknowledge Cassandra’s sudden return? Either topic risked disaster.

Then, the servers arrived with the food, their bustling movements shattering the awkward pause.

As dishes were laid out, Daniel seized the moment. He struck up a lively conversation with Marcus and Vivian about the gourmet spread, skillfully steering the mood away from the brewing storm.

Daniel had taken a liking to Evelyn, and he wasn’t about to let her suffer in silence. Marcus and Vivian, who had warmed up to her earlier, played along effortlessly.

Soon, Beatrice and Lucas joined in, sharing an old story about Marcus. Once, after upsetting Vivian, he had gone all out—hiring eight chefs to help him prepare her favorite dishes as an apology.

Marcus chuckled, pride lacing his voice. "A man’s greatest dowry is humility and cooking skills. When it comes to spoiling a wife, none of you can top me."

Nathan’s gaze flicked up, intrigued. Is that how you cherish someone?

His eyes then drifted to Evelyn, who was mechanically sipping her soup, oblivious to the crab legs right in front of her—her favorite.

Clearly, she was too engrossed in the gossip to care about food.

Suppressing a sigh, Nathan reached for a crab leg. The table froze.

Everyone knew Nathan had a mild seafood allergy. He never touched it.

But then—gasps.

They watched, stunned, as Nathan gloved up, expertly cracked the shell, and extracted the tender meat. He placed it on Evelyn’s plate, even mixing the dipping sauce just how she liked it.

The room held its breath.

Was this a peace offering? A silent declaration?

Or was Nathan Blackwood, the man who never looked back, finally showing his hand?

The movements were executed with deliberate slowness and effortless elegance, as if he'd spent a lifetime tending to the woman beside him.

Evelyn had been stealing glances at the scene unfolding before her, and when she caught sight of it, her eyes stung with unshed tears. How could Nathan dote on another woman—right in front of her, no less?

As Nathan and Evelyn's most devoted shipper, Lillian's eyes widened in shock. She immediately leaned in, whispering urgently into Evelyn's ear, "He's only doing this to provoke you!"

A spark of realization flickered in Evelyn's gaze. Of course. That had to be it. Everyone knew Cassandra had schemed her way into marrying Nathan. There was no way he genuinely cared for a woman who had manipulated him!

Meanwhile, the others exchanged bewildered glances. Flaunting affection wasn't Nathan's style at all.

They couldn't wrap their heads around the idea that Nathan actually cherished his wife. Yet ever since their arrival, one unbelievable thing after another had happened.

Of course, Evelyn remained blissfully unaware that Nathan's actions had unintentionally stirred a storm of emotions among the onlookers.

Completely engrossed in her gossip, Evelyn didn’t even notice Nathan meticulously peeling crab meat for her. Absentmindedly, she ate while her attention remained glued to the scandalous whispers.

What fascinated Evelyn the most after meeting Cassandra was—why had she broken up with Nathan in the first place? Cassandra always seemed to harbor lingering feelings for him, making Evelyn wonder if some hidden struggle had forced her hand.

Nathan, however, couldn’t care less about the past. He saw no point in dredging up old wounds.

Unfortunately for him, Evelyn adored gossip too much. So despite his disinterest, he found himself listening—and learning the truth.

Huh? Did I read that wrong? Evelyn’s sudden thought piqued Nathan’s curiosity, despite his initial indifference.

Her mental commentary continued. I thought this would be some tragic love story. I was even prepared for the classic tropes—terminal illness, a devastating accident, or amnesia. But turns out, her reason for leaving is almost identical to Claire’s—she wanted a higher status. Who would’ve thought even a man like Nathan could be reduced to a rebound?

Nathan froze at the revelation.

Evelyn’s inner monologue carried on. So, her attempt to marry a foreign aristocrat failed. Despite years of effort, he never wanted her. And when she saw Nathan’s rising success, she couldn’t take it anymore. After consulting her family, she finally decided to return and chase after him again.

A subtle shift crossed Nathan’s expression. So that’s how it was. Not that it surprised him—such things were common in his circles. Even knowing he’d been treated as a backup plan didn’t bother him. Others’ opinions had never mattered to him.

If anything, he was amused by the gossip about himself.

After all, Evelyn still assumed he and Cassandra would reconcile—despite him already saying he had moved on.


This had nothing to do with Evelyn. Cassandra never believed him. Instead, she often assumed his words were laced with hidden meanings.

Thus, he thought that since Evelyn had learned Cassandra's intentions were far from pure, she would stop entertaining those absurd fantasies.

How could she do this? Damn it! This is infuriating! Evelyn's furious thoughts suddenly flooded Nathan's mind.

Her heated tone caught Nathan off guard, but he quickly composed himself, a smirk playing on his lips. I'm not even upset, yet Evelyn is fuming on my behalf?

If this is how things stand, how are we ever going to finalize the divorce? Evelyn's panicked internal monologue left Nathan utterly speechless, and it showed no signs of stopping. Originally, I thought I could help reunite them. Now, I can't just stand by and watch Nathan dive headfirst into disaster, can I? But if he doesn't take the plunge, won't my divorce be delayed indefinitely? I've been trapped in this marriage for ages, still waiting for that alimony to find myself a fresh-faced, sculpted young man! Cassandra, you absolute fool! Why can't you just love him properly? You two are supposed to overcome obstacles for love! The way you're handling this is ruining everything for me!

The guests continued their lighthearted chatter while discreetly observing Nathan's unusual behavior of tending to his wife.

Suddenly, they noticed Nathan's brow furrow. He set down the half-peeled crab leg in his hand, removed his gloves, and began eating his own meal in silence, his mood visibly darkened.

The onlookers assumed it was because of Cassandra. After all, Evelyn had been quietly enjoying her food, and moments earlier, someone had asked Cassandra how she'd fared during her years abroad.

Cassandra had replied vaguely, "I managed well."

After speaking, Cassandra caught Nathan's reaction and immediately felt a surge of triumph. I knew it! He still cares about me.

Right then, she noticed Evelyn turn toward her with a disapproving glare and nearly couldn't contain her glee.

"You spent years in a sanatorium. How could you possibly be 'fine'? We're all old friends here, Cassandra. There's no need to hide the truth. Otherwise, certain people might keep dredging up the past to slander you!" Lillian interjected sharply.

"Lillian, don't—" Cassandra feigned distress, attempting to cut her off.

But Lillian barreled on, "Cassandra made me swear never to reveal this to anyone all these years. But today, I can't stay silent any longer. The reason she left back then was because she fell gravely ill. Uncertain of her future and unwilling to burden anyone, she secretly went abroad for treatment."

###Chapter 190 Way Too Cliché
The tension in the room was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathan Blackwood's penthouse, her fingers tracing the condensation on the glass. Outside, the city lights flickered like distant stars, but her mind was far from serene.

Nathan approached her from behind, his presence both comforting and unsettling. "You're thinking too hard," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "How can I not? After everything that's happened—Victoria's schemes, the media frenzy—it's a miracle we're still standing."

Nathan's lips curved into a wry smile. "We always find a way."

She turned to face him, her emerald eyes searching his. "But at what cost? Your family—"

"Is resilient," he interrupted, his voice firm. "Margaret may disapprove, but she'll come around. And Sophia? She's already on your side."

Evelyn bit her lip. "And Julian?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "He'll have to accept it. Whether he likes it or not."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Lillian Graves, Evelyn's ever-efficient assistant, stepped in, her tablet in hand. "Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation."

Evelyn tensed. "What now?"

"Vanessa Sterling just gave an interview," Lillian said, her voice tight. "She's claiming Harrison Montgomery never loved Natalie Whitaker and that their marriage was a sham."

Nathan scoffed. "Desperate move."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Or a calculated one. Vanessa knows exactly what she's doing."

Lillian nodded. "The media's already picking it up. Social media is exploding."

Nathan's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening. "Speak of the devil. Maxwell Thornton wants an emergency meeting."

Evelyn sighed. "Of course he does."

Nathan pocketed his phone. "We'll handle this. Together."

She met his gaze, a flicker of determination igniting within her. "Always."

As they strode out, the weight of the world pressing down on them, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that the storm was far from over. And this time, the stakes were higher than ever.

The truth hit Evelyn like a tidal wave, leaving her drowning in bitter disappointment.



She was trapped in a marriage she couldn’t escape—not unless Nathan himself initiated the divorce. But knowing Nathan’s unwavering sense of responsibility, even if his feelings for her had faded to nothing, he would never be the one to end things.

Evelyn’s only hope had been Cassandra’s return. She had foolishly believed that with the woman back in the picture, she could finally break free. But reality was crueler than fiction.

Cassandra was no saint.

How could Evelyn, in good conscience, help Cassandra reconcile with Nathan? The Blackwood family had treated her with nothing but kindness. Betraying them would be unforgivable.

So she swallowed her resentment, letting it fester inside her like a poison.

While the others were stunned into silence by Lillian’s revelation, Nathan remained lost in his own brooding thoughts. Meanwhile, Evelyn’s gaze sharpened, her bitterness toward Cassandra growing with every passing second.

Cassandra smirked inwardly. Exactly as planned. Once the truth was out, Evelyn would be too shaken to interfere.

Lowering her head, Cassandra feigned discomfort, her expression a perfect blend of embarrassment and reluctance. It was as if she were silently pleading—I never wanted your pity. I never wanted anyone to know.

"What happened?" someone finally asked, breaking the tense silence.

"She was ill," Lillian explained, her voice laced with sympathy. "Very ill."

"Ill? With what?"

"Was she recovering all these years? No wonder we never heard from her."

"How is she now? Is she better?"

"Why didn’t she just explain back then?"

These were friends who had known Cassandra for years. When she left, her sorrowful departure had convinced them all that she must have had no choice. Yet she had refused to confide in anyone, leaving them in agonizing uncertainty. Over time, news of her vanished entirely. Even Claire was stunned by the revelation.

Perhaps no one expected Cassandra, a woman from such a prestigious family, to spin such an elaborate lie. And so, they believed her without question.

Evelyn nearly laughed out loud in sheer frustration. If only she really had been deathly ill! Her so-called "sanitarium stay" had been nothing more than a calculated move to ingratiate herself with the aristocracy by caring for their elderly. Lillian is such a fool, swallowing every word Cassandra feeds her.

Then it clicked.

This was all for Nathan’s benefit. Cassandra was playing the victim, hoping to manipulate his guilt and sympathy. Oh, please. Keep acting. No one does it better than you.

Years ago, she had staged her dramatic exit, ensuring everyone believed she was the wounded party. And that exclusive sanitarium? A perfect cover—aristocratic discretion guaranteed no one would ever expose her lies.

Evelyn clenched her fists. Not this time.

The gossip hadn’t ruined my plans—if anything, I should have been enjoying it. But now, all I wanted was to scream into the void.



Evelyn studied the reactions of those around her and nearly choked on her wine when she realized they were all falling for Cassandra’s act.

Her gaze flickered toward Nathan. He was eating with a deep frown, completely detached from the conversation, his expression unreadable.

Because of her illness, the ex-girlfriend had no choice but to break up with him—she didn’t want to see him suffer. So she vanished, seeking treatment. Now that she’s back, she finds him already married, and all they can do is exchange silent, longing glances. Hah. Nathan doesn’t know the truth. He’ll definitely be fooled.

When Nathan caught Evelyn’s thoughts, his eyes darkened with something unreadable. She cares. Maybe she’ll actually do something to stop me from being deceived.

The mere possibility sent his pulse racing.

But then Evelyn’s next thought shattered that hope.

Out of pity, I might warn Nathan that Cassandra isn’t as perfect as she seems. But since all my intel comes from the system, I can’t explain it properly. In the end, I’ll just look like a jealous wife trying to stir up drama. Cassandra’s already cemented her tragic heroine image. Eventually, they’ll reconcile, and I’ll be the discarded villainess—no alimony, no dignity, just public scorn. Ugh. This is so cliché it hurts.

Nathan’s grip tightened around his fork. How the hell did your brain even get there?

Evelyn’s mental monologue continued, Sorry, Nathan, but self-preservation wins. At most, I won’t enable a snake. If you fall for the wrong woman, that’s your karma. I’m just here for the tea.

Nathan’s jaw clenched. You are my karma.

Evelyn mentally dusted off her hands, satisfied she’d navigated the minefield. The best move now was to sit back and let fate unfold.

But Nathan was this close to snapping. If he weren’t terrified that exposing her mind-reading ability might harm her, he’d have dragged her into a private room and demanded answers.

The room’s atmosphere shifted abruptly. A chill rolled off Nathan, sharp enough to make the others stiffen.

In all their years knowing him, Nathan had always been the picture of control—unshakable, unreadable. Yet now, his turmoil was palpable. They assumed it was because of Cassandra’s heartbreaking confession.

A few pitiful glances slid toward Evelyn. If Cassandra truly had no choice but to leave… and if Nathan’s this affected… their marriage might not last.

Just as the thought settled, Nathan’s burning gaze locked onto Evelyn.

While he seethed over her indifference, the others drew their own conclusions.


The spectators exchanged knowing glances, convinced their assumptions were right—Nathan must be drowning in remorse toward Evelyn. Whispers spread like wildfire—had Nathan really given up on Evelyn so easily?

Cassandra's lips curled in triumph, her heart racing with anticipation.

Evelyn felt the weight of Nathan's gaze upon her. When their eyes met, his dark irises swirled like midnight storms, threatening to consume her entire world. Her pulse quickened inexplicably.

Under his intense scrutiny, Evelyn squirmed with sudden guilt. "W-What is it?"

Nathan, never one to falter, swiftly regained his composure. "You've got something here."

With deliberate slowness, he plucked a linen napkin from the table. His fingers brushed the corner of her mouth, wiping away a trace of sauce with featherlight precision. The intimacy of the gesture created an invisible bubble around them, shutting out the gawking crowd.

Evelyn froze. So did everyone else.

Had this happened moments earlier, the room would've buzzed with theories about Nathan deliberately provoking Cassandra. But now? The timing made zero sense.

Baffled murmurs rippled through the gathering. Since when does Nathan dote on his wife like this? Even strangers would react to such explosive news—especially when it involved his ex! Yet here he was, fussing over a speck of sauce instead of grappling with emotional turmoil.

What game is he playing? Evelyn's mind whirled. After hearing something that monumental, shouldn't he at least look conflicted? Distracted? Anything but... this! Her confusion must have shown, because Nathan's eyes gleamed with something dangerously close to amusement.

He leaned infinitesimally closer, practically begging her to peek into his thoughts. If words won't convince her, he mused, let her see the truth for herself.

Normally, Evelyn respected mental boundaries, skimming only surface-level gossip from acquaintances. But curiosity burned through her restraint. Maybe he zoned out earlier? Could he have missed the entire bombshell? Steeling herself, she reached out with her ability—and stiffened.

Huh?!

###Chapter 191 Wishing You A Speedy Recovery
The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse. She stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absently. The city below was just waking up, but her mind was already racing with the day's agenda.

Her phone buzzed violently against the marble countertop. The caller ID flashed "Nathan Blackwood" - a name that never failed to make her pulse quicken. She hesitated for exactly three seconds before answering.

"Evelyn." His deep voice resonated through the line, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine. "We need to talk."

"About?" She kept her tone deliberately light, though her grip on the phone tightened.

"The merger. My board is getting restless." There was an edge to his voice she hadn't heard before. "They want guarantees."

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Your board? Or Victoria Hayes?"

A beat of silence. Then Nathan's voice dropped lower, more intimate. "Meet me at the Blackwood Tower in an hour. We'll settle this properly."

Before she could respond, the line went dead. Evelyn stared at her reflection in the window - the carefully constructed mask of composure barely hiding the storm beneath. Victoria Hayes, Nathan's scheming secretary, had been undermining her at every turn. And now it seemed her poison was spreading.

The intercom buzzed. "Ms. Sinclair? Lillian is here with your schedule."

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Send her in."

Lillian Graves entered with her usual efficiency, tablet in hand. "Morning briefing is at nine with Preston Whitmore. The investors' lunch was moved to-"

"Cancel everything before noon." Evelyn grabbed her blazer from the back of the chair. "I'm going to Blackwood Tower."

Lillian's eyebrows shot up but she made no comment, simply tapping adjustments into her tablet. "Shall I call your driver?"

"No." Evelyn's smile was razor-sharp. "I'll take my car. This requires a dramatic entrance."

As she strode toward the private elevator, Evelyn's mind raced through possible scenarios. Nathan's sudden urgency meant something had shifted. The merger between Sinclair Media and Blackwood Enterprises was supposed to be straightforward - a perfect match of her creative vision and his business empire. But Victoria had been planting doubts, whispering about Evelyn's "unpredictable temperament" to anyone who would listen.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal the underground garage. Evelyn's cherry-red Aston Martin gleamed under the fluorescent lights - a gift from Nathan on their one-year anniversary. The memory of his hands sliding over the hood as he presented it to her flashed unbidden, making her breath catch.

She shook her head sharply. Business first. Emotions later.

The drive to Blackwood Tower took twenty minutes through morning traffic. Evelyn used the time to compose herself, rehearsing arguments in her head. But nothing could have prepared her for what awaited in Nathan's office.

As the elevator doors opened directly into his private suite, Evelyn froze. Nathan stood by the window, his usual commanding presence somehow more intense. But it was the woman seated across from him that made Evelyn's blood run cold.

Victoria Hayes turned with a feline smile. "Evelyn. How... punctual."

Nathan's expression was unreadable as he gestured to the empty chair. "We were just discussing the merger terms."

Evelyn forced her legs to move forward, her heels clicking ominously on the polished concrete. "How... cozy." She took the offered seat without breaking eye contact with Victoria. "Shall we get to the point?"

Nathan leaned against his desk, his crisp white shirt straining slightly over his broad shoulders. "Victoria has raised some... interesting concerns about the merger structure."

"Has she?" Evelyn kept her voice light, though her nails were digging into her palms. "Do enlighten me."

Victoria's smile didn't reach her cold blue eyes. "Your last quarterly reports showed significant losses in the European division. My team has concerns about absorbing that debt."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "My European division is undergoing strategic restructuring. The 'losses' are planned investments." She turned to Nathan. "Surely you explained this?"

Nathan's gaze flickered between them. "I did. But Victoria makes a valid point about risk assessment."

The betrayal stung more than Evelyn cared to admit. She stood abruptly, smoothing her skirt with deliberate calm. "If you're having second thoughts, Nathan, perhaps we should postpone the merger entirely."

Victoria's triumphant smirk was barely concealed as she stood as well. "A wise suggestion. These things shouldn't be rushed."

Nathan's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Victoria. Leave us."

The secretary's face fell. "But-"

"Now."

With one last poisonous glance at Evelyn, Victoria swept from the room. The moment the door clicked shut, Nathan crossed the space between them in three strides.

"You're playing a dangerous game," he murmured, his breath warm against her temple.

Evelyn refused to back down. "Am I? Or is your secretary overstepping her bounds?"

Nathan's hand came up to cradle her jaw, his thumb brushing her lower lip. "You know where my loyalties lie."

"Do I?" Evelyn pulled back just enough to meet his gaze. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're letting her sabotage everything we've built."

Nathan's expression darkened. He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a thick document. "This is the revised merger agreement. My lawyers worked on it all night." He flipped to a highlighted section. "See clause 17-B."

Evelyn scanned the text, her breath catching. "This... this gives me controlling interest in the combined entity."

"Fifty-one percent." Nathan's voice was rough. "No board, no Victoria, no one can ever come between us again."

Evelyn's hands trembled as she set the papers down. "Why would you do this?"

Nathan cupped her face, his eyes burning with intensity. "Because I'd give you everything, Evelyn. My company, my name, my heart. If you'll have them."

The world seemed to tilt on its axis. Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but the office door burst open before she could speak.

Victoria stood framed in the doorway, her face pale. "Nathan, you can't possibly-"

"Get out!" Nathan roared, his voice shaking the glass walls.

But Victoria didn't move. Instead, her lips curled into a vicious smile. "I think you'll want to hear this first." She held up her phone. "The press just got wind of Evelyn's little... indiscretion with Sebastian Hart last summer."

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. "That was before Nathan and I-"

"Photos don't care about timelines," Victoria purred. "And these are quite... compromising."

Nathan's grip on Evelyn's waist tightened almost painfully. "What is she talking about?"

Evelyn met his gaze squarely, her voice steady despite the storm inside. "It was one dinner. Nothing happened."

Victoria's laugh was like nails on a chalkboard. "Tell that to Page Six. The headline writes itself: 'Media Heiress's Secret Affair with Married Actor.'"

The room spun. Evelyn could see the calculations flashing behind Nathan's eyes - the scandal, the shareholders, the carefully constructed image. She braced for the withdrawal, the coldness that would follow.

Instead, Nathan's mouth crashed down on hers in a kiss that burned away all doubt. When he finally pulled back, his eyes blazed with possession.

"Release a statement," he told Victoria without looking away from Evelyn. "Confirm that Evelyn and I have been in a committed relationship for over a year. That Sebastian Hart was never more than a business associate." His thumb traced Evelyn's swollen lips. "And that any suggestion otherwise will be met with immediate legal action."

Victoria's mouth opened and closed like a fish. "But the board-"

"Will fall in line." Nathan's voice left no room for argument. "Now get out."

As the door slammed shut behind Victoria, Evelyn found herself pressed against the desk, Nathan's body caging her in. "You're sure about this?" she whispered.

Nathan's smile was feral. "I've never been more sure of anything in my life." He nipped at her lower lip. "But you owe me an explanation about Sebastian Hart."

Evelyn tangled her fingers in his hair. "Later." She pulled him down for another kiss. "We have a merger to finalize."

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the city stretched endlessly below them. But in that moment, the only empire that mattered was the one they were building together.

Evelyn's sigh made Nathan tense up.

That's odd. Really odd! The thought flashed through Evelyn's mind, startling Nathan.



What's strange? Is it really that unusual that I don't have feelings for Cassandra? Or is it my current emotions toward Evelyn that are strange? Nathan's restless heart sank slightly.

He had always been slow when it came to matters of the heart. Often, he couldn't even tell if people around him liked him. Only when faced with Cassandra's—and the past Evelyn's—persistent advances had he recognized their affection.

And it was only recently that he realized he was slow to acknowledge his own feelings too.

His brief college romance had been fleeting, and he'd never truly cared for Cassandra. Back then, he hadn't understood—nor had he bothered to—simply drifting along. But someone had changed that.

Evelyn had slipped into his thoughts in the most peculiar way, making him think of her without meaning to. His emotions had become unpredictable because of her—anger, happiness, worry, disappointment—all foreign to his usually indifferent nature. Since that fateful day, he'd been on an emotional rollercoaster.

He hated losing control, yet he couldn't resist the pull. Even if he wasn't the most perceptive in these matters, a little rational thought was enough to reach the obvious conclusion: he had fallen for Evelyn.

But how deep those feelings ran, he couldn't say—nor did he feel the need to. After all, she was the only one who stirred these emotions in him. And legally, she was his wife. Of course, he had ulterior motives. Before, he'd resisted divorce out of duty and respect for marriage. Now? He simply didn’t want to let her go.

Nathan, always composed, methodical, and logical, found his thoughts tangled once again—because of Evelyn.

Like a lovestruck teenager, he was naive and bewildered.

If first love was defined by genuine, heartfelt affection, then Evelyn was his true first love in every sense.

As his thoughts spiraled, a sudden wave of nervousness hit him. He remembered what Evelyn had once said—"Affection returned too late is worthless." Was she calling him strange because she'd sensed his past indifference when she read his mind?

But there was nothing he could do about it. Their past relationship had been built on obligation. If not for Evelyn’s unchanged appearance, he might have doubted whether the past and present Evelyn were even the same person. Right now, all he wanted was to be with the Evelyn of today.

Just as Nathan lost himself in memories, a sudden flash of a little girl's face stunned him. She beamed at him, asking, "Nate, why are you so quiet? Can't you speak? If that's the case, let me talk more. You'll learn if you listen. Want to hear some juicy gossip about my family?"

"Nathan, you're absolutely gorgeous. One day, I'll make enough money to spoil you rotten!"

"Nathan, you're too thin! Eat more—I adore those sculpted abs!"

"Hah! Your first kiss belongs to me, Nathan!"

Nathan Blackwood froze. Were these memories of Evelyn Sinclair as a child?

Given the close ties between their families, frequent visits had been arranged despite living in different cities. It wasn’t unusual for them to have met as children. However, back then, Nathan rarely stayed at the Blackwood estate, unlike now. His recollections of his siblings were sparse, let alone whether he and Evelyn had ever played together.

His memories were hazy. Suddenly, his thoughts were cut off by Evelyn’s internal argument with the system.

WYSICUL

Evelyn’s mental voice shrieked, Why is there a mosaic here?! I used to see everything—even the fact that he’s still a virgin! Why is it all censored now?!

Nathan nearly choked but brushed it off.

The result he’d been waiting for hadn’t arrived. He was stunned. What’s happening? Why the mosaic?

Evelyn’s thoughts raged on. System, you must be malfunctioning. Can’t you dig up any gossip besides predicting the future? I demand an upgrade! A repair! You’re not broken? Then… Huh? No access to gossip about direct relevant figures?

Nathan was baffled.

What does that mean? Someone who’ll directly impact my life? But how? Is it because we’re not divorced? Is he my primary responsibility figure? That can’t be—we weren’t divorced before either! Evelyn mentally ranted.

Though not obsessed with prying into private lives, Evelyn couldn’t comprehend this sudden restriction. Previously, information had been blocked only if it could drastically alter the world. Yet now, Nathan’s details were specifically barred.

No matter how much she argued with the system, it was useless. She couldn’t uncover a thing.

Nathan mused, Perhaps the system recognizes my feelings for her. To ensure our relationship progresses naturally, it’s preventing her from reading my thoughts.

He was wildly speculating—the system was an unpredictable force.

Another oddity struck him. Evelyn never seems to realize we can hear her thoughts. Is that also because it would affect her life? Hmm… Maybe I shouldn’t tell her about this.

Truthfully, Nathan wanted to know Evelyn on equal footing. He had no intention of keeping this mind-reading ability.

But for now, all he could do was watch silently. Even as frustration simmered within him, he remained still.

Nathan Blackwood was utterly frustrated—his innocence remained unproven.

It doesn't matter if she can't see my information. Nathan gazed at Evelyn Sinclair, his lips curving into a tender smile.

With every moment of introspection, every attempt to decipher his own emotions, he became more certain of one thing: Evelyn was extraordinary to him.

He wanted to prove—no, needed to prove—that he was sincere about continuing this journey with her. His only hope? That when he confessed his feelings again, she wouldn’t see him as someone who hid the truth.

While Nathan was lost in thought, Evelyn was spiraling in her own chaotic world.

Meanwhile, the crowd around them was on the verge of losing their minds.

Because Nathan wasn’t just dabbing the corner of Evelyn’s lips—his thumb lingered, brushing against the soft pink of her mouth.

To everyone watching, it was an unmistakable act of intimacy.

Vivian Grant and Marcus Prescott recognized the gesture immediately—they were that kind of couple. Marcus often traced Vivian’s lips just like that, tender and possessive.

The others remembered them too—the shamelessly affectionate pair—and now they were gaping, torn between disbelief and secondhand embarrassment.

Was Nathan serious? Or was this deliberate?

Earlier, they had pitied Evelyn. Now, they couldn’t bear the scene unfolding before them, their gazes flickering toward Cassandra instead.

Because this? This didn’t look accidental at all.

Cassandra paled.

She was the only one who knew the truth.

Back when their relationship had been paraded as perfect to the world, Nathan had never touched her like this.

Her composure shattered. For the first time, she felt truly shaken.

"Nathan!" Lillian Graves exploded.

Both Evelyn and Nathan jolted.

Evelyn had been too distracted by the system glitch to notice Nathan’s thumb still resting against her lips. The shout startled her, snapping her attention back to reality.

Nathan, meanwhile, froze the moment he realized what he’d done. His fingertips burned, his mind blanking for a split second.

I must have… remembered that time Evelyn claimed she stole my first kiss as a child.

Childhood kisses meant nothing—he’d even forgotten about it until now. But the memory had resurfaced, vivid and insistent, making him crave the ghost of that fleeting touch.

Yet he couldn’t recall the details.

Discomfort coiled in his chest.

And when he finally regained his senses, he didn’t immediately turn to Lillian.

The moment Evelyn noticed Nathan's lingering gaze still fixed on Cassandra, her blood boiled with barely contained fury.

With forced politeness, Nathan finally turned to Lily. "Yes?" His expression remained frustratingly blank, as if completely unaware of the tension crackling in the air.

Lily drew in a sharp, audible breath, her manicured nails digging into her palms as she glared daggers at the oblivious couple. "Everyone here is worried sick about Cassandra," she spat through clenched teeth. "Yet you stand there without a care in the world? Have you no heart at all?"

Her voice trembled with barely restrained anger. "Even if you're still holding onto old grudges, now that you know the truth, you must understand Cassandra had no other choice!" Lily's accusatory finger jabbed toward Nathan. "Don't you have anything to say to her?"

"Please, Lily, stop!" Cassandra reached out weakly, her delicate fingers grasping Lily's sleeve in a theatrical display of restraint. Her doe eyes flickered nervously toward Evelyn, feigning concern about causing discord between the couple. The performance was almost Oscar-worthy.

But Lily wasn't having any of it. "I demand an answer, Nathan!" she snapped, shaking off Cassandra's feeble grip.

Seeing her act wasn't working, Cassandra's eyes welled up with crocodile tears as she turned her pleading gaze toward Nathan. The entire table shifted uncomfortably, several guests shooting disapproving looks at the seemingly heartless Nathan.

After a long, deliberate pause, Nathan finally spoke with infuriating calmness. "Well... I hope you recover soon."

###Chapter 192 - Savoring Juicy Gossip in Her Mind
The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden patterns across her silk sheets. Stretching like a contented cat, she reached for her phone with a smirk already playing on her lips. Today promised delicious drama.

Three unread messages from Lillian Graves blinked on her screen. Evelyn's manicured finger hovered over the notifications with the anticipation of a child unwrapping presents. The first message contained a blurry photo of Nathan Blackwood leaving a high-end hotel at 2 AM. The second showed him helping a stunning brunette into his Lamborghini. The third simply read: "His new flavor of the month?"

Evelyn's laughter echoed through the spacious bedroom as she imagined Victoria Hayes's reaction to these photos. That scheming secretary had been throwing herself at Nathan for months, convinced she'd become the next Mrs. Blackwood. Oh, how the mighty would fall.

Rolling onto her stomach, Evelyn dialed Preston Whitmore with the phone wedged between her shoulder and ear. "Cancel my morning meetings," she purred while scrolling through her contacts. "I'm declaring a personal day to enjoy this entertainment."

The director's protest was cut short as she hung up, already typing a new message to Donovan Sharpe: "Remember that indie project Victoria was begging you for? Let's give it to Seraphina Delacroix instead. Consider it... poetic justice."

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Julian Blackwood. Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. Nathan's younger brother never contacted her directly. This was getting better by the minute.

"Julian, darling," she answered in her sweetest tone, "to what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?"

"Evelyn." His voice carried uncharacteristic tension. "We need to talk about whatever game you're playing with my brother."

She twirled a lock of honey-blonde hair around her finger. "Games? Me? I'm simply an observer enjoying the show."

A pause. Then Julian's quiet warning: "Be careful. The Blackwoods don't take kindly to puppeteers."

The call ended abruptly, leaving Evelyn staring at her reflection in the vanity mirror. Her smile didn't waver. Threats from the Blackwood siblings only made the game more thrilling. She opened her laptop and began drafting an email to all major entertainment reporters with the subject line: "Blackwood Heir's Midnight Rendezvous - Exclusive Photos."

As the message sent, Evelyn stretched back against her pillows, imagining the chaos about to unfold. Victoria's humiliation. Nathan's frustration. Julian's anger. And best of all? She'd orchestrated it all without leaving a single fingerprint.

Her phone chimed with a breaking news alert from Celebrity Insider. The headline made her giggle aloud: "Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Mystery Woman - Is Wedding to Socialite Off?"

Evelyn tapped her champagne flute against the screen in a mock toast. "Let the games begin."
A chilling silence descended upon the room.


Is he mentally unstable or just completely devoid of ethics? What kind of twisted logic is this? Evelyn's thoughts screamed through her mind, unwittingly broadcasted to Nathan.

The man in question merely raised an eyebrow in innocent confusion. Isn't this basic courtesy?

If Cassandra wants to pretend she's ill, I'll simply treat her as a patient and wish her speedy recovery. Perfectly reasonable.

Yet Nathan's "perfect logic" left everyone in the dining room utterly gobsmacked.

Even Lillian, who had been fuming moments earlier, found herself speechless, her anger momentarily derailed by sheer disbelief.

Whether from genuine distress or shock-induced forgetfulness, Cassandra's carefully maintained composure shattered as tears began streaming down her face.

By the time the stunned guests regained their senses, they were scrambling to console the weeping socialite.

Cassandra quickly collected herself, forcing a brave smile. "It's nothing," she sniffled delicately. "Just some chili oil that got into my eyes earlier."

In truth, her mind was still reeling, but years of social conditioning automatically prompted her to choose the most sympathetic response.

As predicted, her performance further darkened the guests' opinions of Nathan.

They wanted to voice their disapproval, but cold logic prevented them - how could they fault a man for wishing someone good health?

Meanwhile, Nathan remained completely unperturbed, as if entirely detached from the drama he'd created. Having delivered his "kind wishes," he considered his social obligation fulfilled.

Noticing Evelyn's empty plate, he selected another crab leg and began meticulously peeling it for his wife.

This simple domestic gesture derailed Evelyn's train of thought entirely.

It wasn't the act itself that confused her - Nathan had always been attentive during meals, which she'd attributed to his sense of spousal duty.

But why now? In this charged atmosphere? Has his love turned to resentment? Is he punishing me for keeping secrets when I left?

Nathan's hands stilled momentarily at her mental accusation. Again with this?

Unlike last time, he didn't set down the shellfish. Evelyn's plate needed filling, after all.

Suppressing a sigh, he resumed his task with forced patience.

Something's not adding up, Evelyn mused. He seems genuinely indifferent, almost distant. Was I wrong about everything? Were his previous declarations sincere? Has he truly moved on? Her thoughts spiraled as she studied her husband's impassive face.

His anger had melted away, replaced by a smirk. I knew it. As long as I stayed true and honest, the truth would always find its way to the surface.

Nathan poured a steaming cup of chamomile tea for Evelyn, his voice barely above a whisper. "Finish this. You're not getting another."

Evelyn blinked at him, uncomprehending.

Though Nathan had spoken softly, every word carried across the table. The others exchanged uneasy glances. Was this another one of his calculated performances, or did he genuinely care for Evelyn? The ambiguity hung thick in the air, leaving them shifting uncomfortably in their seats.

Meanwhile, Cassandra was struggling to hold back her tears. Her quiet, choked sobs were just loud enough to unsettle everyone at the table—not to mention drawing curious stares from neighboring diners. Even Evelyn couldn’t take it anymore and inched closer to Nathan.

Instinctively, he leaned toward her. Their heads nearly collided before Evelyn caught him just in time. Then, in a voice so small it was almost lost beneath the clatter of silverware, she murmured, "She’s crying. You should…"

Of course, Evelyn didn’t actually want Nathan to comfort Cassandra. She knew exactly what kind of person Cassandra was—every tear, every trembling breath was just another act. But without being able to read Nathan’s mind like usual, Evelyn felt adrift. She burned to ask him: Why are you reacting like this?

Nathan met her gaze, his expression unreadable. "She isn’t crying."

Evelyn nearly choked. Are you blind? What kind of nonsense is that?

Nathan barely suppressed an eye roll.

The table had gone eerily silent.

Nathan arched a brow. "Didn’t she say she got chili in her eye?"

The silence turned suffocating.

Even Cassandra’s sobs cut off abruptly.

Evelyn sucked in a sharp breath, barely stifling a laugh. Hah! What the hell is he saying? It wasn’t even funny—just so absurdly literal that she couldn’t help it. While everyone else read between the lines, Nathan had taken Cassandra’s words at face value.

Hearing Evelyn’s thoughts, Nathan’s lips curled. It’s Cassandra’s own fault for saying it.

If Nathan had been friends with Cassandra for years before their ill-fated romance, even if their relationship had crumbled, at least their friendship might have remained intact.

But now?

Now, he couldn’t care less.

The moment Nathan uncovered Cassandra's web of deceit and realized her intentions to sabotage his marriage with Evelyn, all he felt was pure contempt.

"Nathan, you..." Lillian finally found her voice again, her hands trembling at her sides. "This is too much!"

A cold, questioning gaze from Nathan silenced her mid-sentence. Her eyes instantly welled up with tears, her lips quivering.

She cares this much about her friend? Oh... Oh! Evelyn's thoughts flickered with realization, and Nathan caught the shift in her expression, his curiosity piqued.

To him, Lillian was nothing short of a fool. While their classmates might have once wished for him to end up with Cassandra, none had dared to voice such thoughts after his marriage. At most, they entertained the idea privately.

The reason was simple—meddling in someone else's marriage and endorsing an affair was morally reprehensible. Almost no one would openly support such a thing.

Which was why Nathan found himself genuinely baffled. What on earth is going through her mind?

She’s been secretly in love with Nathan all along! Evelyn deduced, her lips curving slightly.

Nathan’s internal response was dry. Well, I suppose I don’t need to wonder anymore.

Evelyn continued analyzing. So she’s both his admirer and a hardcore shipper? Meaning, aside from Cassandra, she won’t accept anyone else being with him. Tsk, tsk—that’s not devotion, that’s an obsession needing therapy.

Exactly. Nathan agreed silently.

Huh. So Cassandra knows about her feelings and is using her as a pawn? Evelyn mused.

Nathan’s brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. That just makes me despise her even more.

Meanwhile, the others remained oblivious to this dynamic, assuming Lillian was merely defending her friend. Given Cassandra and Nathan’s history, they also found his harshness somewhat unjustified.

"Lillian, stop," Cassandra finally interjected, realizing her friend wasn’t achieving the desired effect. She forced a fragile smile, tears glistening on her cheeks. "It really was just the chili that made me cry. And Nathan… thank you for your concern. I’m better now. The treatment was difficult, but I held onto hope. I… I’ve said too much. I’m fine. Truly, I am."

Her voice trembled just enough to wrench at the heartstrings of anyone listening.

Then, Cassandra turned to Evelyn, her expression painfully earnest. "Seeing how happy you two are together… it brings me peace. I wish you both all the happiness in the world."

At that, Lillian snapped back to her mission.

"You shouldn’t say that, Cassandra! Nathan, do you even know what your wife has been doing behind your back?"

Evelyn, who had been quietly observing Cassandra’s performance, blinked in shock. What exactly have I done?

Nathan, equally unimpressed by Cassandra’s theatrics, merely arched a brow at Lillian, waiting for her next move.

Lillian's fingers flew across her phone screen with practiced ease, her manicured nails tapping furiously as she exposed Evelyn's transgressions to the entire dinner party. "Cassandra had reached out to you months ago," she announced, her voice dripping with righteous indignation. "She wanted to meet face-to-face to finally put that ancient misunderstanding to rest."

A collective gasp rippled through the assembled guests as Lillian thrust her phone toward Nathan. The screen displayed damning evidence—intercepted emails, private correspondence laid bare for all to see. "But your precious wife," Lillian continued, her lips curling in triumph, "didn't just violate your privacy by snooping through your messages. She took it upon herself to threaten Cassandra using your account!"

The crystal chandelier above them seemed to tremble as Nathan's expression darkened. Across the table, Evelyn's champagne flute slipped from her fingers, shattering against the marble floor like their carefully constructed façade.

Lillian wasn't . With a theatrical swipe, she revealed the pièce de résistance—a screenshot of Evelyn's final warning to Cassandra: "Stay away from my husband if you know what's good for you." The timestamp showed it had been sent during Nathan's business trip to Milan—the same week Evelyn had claimed her phone was stolen.

Victoria Hayes, seated strategically beside Nathan, leaned in with feigned concern. "Darling," she purred, placing a possessive hand on his arm, "I always said there was something... unstable about her."

The dining room plunged into chaos as guests erupted in scandalized whispers. Only Preston Whitmore noticed how Evelyn's trembling hands weren't from shame—but from barely contained fury. As their eyes met across the table, the director realized with dawning horror that they'd all severely underestimated Mrs. Blackwood.

Somewhere beneath the hysterics, a silver fork clattered to the floor—the first domino in a chain reaction none of them saw coming.
###Chapter 193 An Opportunity

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, savoring the quiet before the storm of the day. But the peace was short-lived.

A familiar voice echoed in her mind—sharp, calculating, and laced with venom.

"If only Evelyn knew what Nathan truly thinks of her," Victoria Hayes mused, her thoughts dripping with smug satisfaction. "That naïve little writer has no idea he’s only keeping her around for the publicity."

Evelyn nearly choked on her tea.

Her rare ability—unwanted and unpredictable—had struck again. She could hear the innermost thoughts of those around her, and right now, Victoria’s mental monologue was a symphony of malice.

"Once the Blackwood deal is finalized, he’ll drop her like yesterday’s news," Victoria continued, flipping through files in her office downtown. "Honestly, how does she not see it? He’s never even introduced her to his mother."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup.

Nathan Blackwood had been nothing but attentive, hadn’t he? The late-night calls, the whispered promises, the way his gaze lingered a second too long—had it all been an act?

Her phone buzzed. A text from Nathan:

"Dinner tonight? I have something important to tell you."

Her stomach twisted.

Was this it? The moment he’d finally reveal the truth? Or worse—end things?

Across town, Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-loyal agent, paced her office, her thoughts a frantic whirlwind.

"If Victoria’s scheming reaches Nathan’s ears before Evelyn can defend herself…" Serena’s mental voice was tense. "That woman’s been waiting for this chance since day one."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She needed answers. Now.

But before she could move, another voice slithered into her mind—smooth, arrogant, and unmistakably Nathan’s brother, Julian Blackwood.

"Let’s see how long it takes for Evelyn to realize she’s just another pawn," Julian mused, swirling whiskey in his glass. "The Blackwoods play for keeps, little writer. And you? You’re disposable."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Was this the real Nathan? The man behind the charming smiles and tender touches?

Her phone buzzed again—Victoria, this time.

"Emergency meeting at Blackwood Tower. Be there by noon. Don’t be late."

The trap was closing in.

And Evelyn? She was done playing the fool.

"Cassandra had no ulterior motives. She simply wanted to clear the air with you and ease your inner turmoil," Lillian declared, her voice trembling with agitation.

All eyes shifted to the cell phone screen displaying Evelyn's email inbox.

A reply from Nathan's personal email address glared back at them:

This is Evelyn Sinclair, Mrs. Blackwood. My husband has asked me to handle this correspondence. Ms. Smith, I'd prefer if you refrain from contacting him again.

Gasps rippled through the room—not because anyone disapproved of Evelyn responding as Nathan's wife. As his spouse, being wary of his ex was perfectly justified.

But this was Nathan Blackwood's private email. A man notorious for his ironclad boundaries and obsessive privacy. No one believed he'd ever permit anyone else to access it.

After all, Nathan and Evelyn weren't exactly the epitome of marital trust. At least, that's what everyone assumed.

The inevitable conclusion? Evelyn must have stumbled upon the email and secretly replied—eliminating a romantic rival.

All eyes locked onto Evelyn, who had risen from her seat, her gaze fixed on Lillian's phone.

Secondhand embarrassment flooded the room. They imagined Evelyn never expected her subterfuge would be exposed so publicly—especially in front of Nathan.

When they glanced at Nathan, his expression had turned to stone.

Confirmation, they thought. Nathan had no idea Cassandra contacted him.

Seizing the moment, Lillian turned to Nathan. "Is your coldness toward Cassandra because Evelyn spun lies to poison you against her? Just like this hidden email? If you resent Cassandra, say it to her face!"

Lillian refused to believe Nathan would treat Cassandra so harshly unless someone manipulated him. She couldn't fathom another explanation.

Truthfully, Cassandra agreed. Evelyn had once clawed her way into Nathan's life by any means necessary. Given Nathan's current attitude, Cassandra was certain Evelyn had been scheming again.

The revelation stunned everyone.

Moments ago, they'd found Nathan's behavior toward Cassandra inexplicable. Though some secretly hoped the former flames might rekindle, they knew Nathan's character—no matter his feelings, he'd always maintain civility upon reuniting with an ex.

Yet here he stood, icily dismissive.

The only logical explanation?

Evelyn's interference.

A tense silence descended as all awaited Nathan's response.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists, her nails biting into her palms. She hadn't anticipated this ambush.

Nathan's glacial gaze swept over Lillian before settling on Evelyn.

The air thickened with unspoken accusations.

Then—

"Enough."

Nathan's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Everyone held their breath.

What followed would determine everything.

The air was thick with tension, yet Nathan remained utterly indifferent toward Cassandra. Even after the truth about their past had been laid bare, his expression didn’t flicker. The lack of reaction made everyone assume there must have been some cliché misunderstanding between them.

And who else could be blamed for such a misunderstanding but Evelyn?

All eyes turned toward Evelyn, who stood frozen in place, while Nathan remained silent.

Their reaction only fueled Cassandra and Lily’s confidence—their plan had worked. They had exposed Evelyn, revealing her supposed manipulations to Nathan. We should’ve done this sooner, Lily thought smugly.

With a triumphant smirk, Lily turned to Evelyn and sneered, "Don’t think that marriage certificate makes you special. Everyone knows how you became Mrs. Blackwood. In love, the one who isn’t cherished is the real outsider. All your schemes are worthless!"

Roland cleared his throat, cutting in sharply. "Lily, you’ve had too much to drink. Stop spouting nonsense."

"What’s wrong with protecting your own marriage?" Vivian Grant chimed in, not necessarily defending Evelyn but challenging Lily’s logic.

Marcus Prescott nodded in agreement. "She’s right, darling."

Meanwhile, Gwendolyn Brooks watched silently from the sidelines, her heart aching for her idol. The woman who had stood as a beacon of justice for so many vulnerable women was now being publicly humiliated. These so-called elites have no morals, she thought bitterly. "A mistress is still a mistress," she muttered under her breath.

"What did you just say?" Grayson Hart shot her a warning glare, silencing her instantly.

Damien and Deborah, who had initially been entertained by the drama, now found the scene distasteful. They exchanged glances, sympathy flickering in their eyes for Evelyn, who stood alone under the weight of their scrutiny.

She looked like a woman desperately clinging to a crumbling marriage.

"I thought you had changed, but clearly, you haven’t," Mason Hunter remarked, seizing the moment to voice his disdain.

Just as he  speaking, an inexplicable chill ran down his spine. His gaze flicked toward the main entrance, where the servers bustled in and out. For a brief moment, he thought he saw—

No. There was nothing.

His mind wandered to Violet Carter, who had mentioned working late tonight. Did she eat yet? The thought distracted him, and suddenly, the urge to mock Evelyn faded.

But the drama continued without him.

"Evelyn, how could you stoop so low? Oh Nathan, don't be angry with Evelyn. Still, this is terribly unfair to Cassandra. Perhaps an apology is in order?" Claire proposed with feigned concern.

"Unnecessary. The fault lies with me. I shouldn't have reached out to Nathan. Evelyn, you acted appropriately." Cassandra's voice trembled, thick with unshed tears as she addressed Evelyn. "I followed your instructions and ceased all contact with Nathan. But this is a reunion. I hesitated to come, yet it's been ages since I've seen everyone. I missed them. That's my only reason for being here. Pay no mind to Violet's words. That Chapter is closed."

"Cassandra, your kindness will be your undoing! Who knows what schemes this woman has woven behind your backs to drive this wedge between you!" Violet declared, having already convicted Evelyn without trial.

Silence was my native tongue, but their theatrics were bordering on absurd! While I relish gossip, being its subject kills the fun, Evelyn thought bitterly.

Snapping from his stunned embarrassment, Nathan found himself in unprecedented discomfort, his entire body burning with humiliation.

The female psyche remained an enigma - he'd never anticipated that email becoming a weapon against Evelyn.

Now he truly understood the meaning of mortification.

As he prepared to stand and clarify, Evelyn's inner monologue raged: No investigation needed - this is clearly fabricated to frame me. Their dedication to winning Nathan over is impressive.

Nathan mentally countered: Actually, that's not—

Evelyn continued plotting: They'll regret slandering me! Now, how best to teach them a lesson?

No need. I'll handle it, Nathan interjected silently.

A sly smile touched Evelyn's lips. Wait! Retaliating now puts me at a disadvantage. Without Nathan's backing in this tangled web, I'd become the laughingstock. But...this presents an opportunity! I'll feign innocence later. Given their convincing performance, Nathan won't easily believe me. We'll argue, escalate a minor issue until it spirals out of control, then... Hehehe...

Nathan barely suppressed an eye roll. Indeed...what an opportunity.

Suddenly, Evelyn rose with determination.

But before she could speak, Nathan stood abruptly, pulling her firmly into his embrace.

###Chapter 194 The Language of Love Lost in Translation
The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind already buzzing with anticipation. Today was one of those rare days when she could indulge in her little guilty pleasure—reading the unfiltered thoughts of those around her.

Ever since she’d discovered her peculiar ability, Evelyn had found it impossible to resist peeking into the private musings of others. It was like having a backstage pass to the most dramatic soap opera imaginable. And today? Oh, today promised to be juicy.

She slipped into a silk robe and padded barefoot to the kitchen, where her assistant, Lillian Graves, was already preparing coffee. The moment Evelyn entered, Lillian’s thoughts hit her like a tidal wave.

"Ugh, why does she always look so perfect in the morning? It’s not fair. And why did I agree to work for her again? Oh right—the paycheck. But still…"

Evelyn smirked, pouring herself a cup. "Good morning, Lillian. Sleep well?"

Lillian blinked, startled. "Y-yes, Ms. Sinclair. Very well, thank you."

"How does she do that? It’s like she knows when I’m thinking about her."

Evelyn took a slow sip, savoring both the coffee and Lillian’s internal panic.

By the time she arrived at the Blackwood Enterprises headquarters, the mental chatter had intensified. The lobby was a symphony of scandalous secrets—secretaries plotting office romances, executives hiding financial discrepancies, and interns daydreaming about seducing their bosses.

But the real prize? Nathan Blackwood’s private elevator ride.

As the doors slid shut, sealing them in together, Nathan’s deep voice broke the silence. "You’re late."

Evelyn arched a brow. "By two minutes. Hardly a crime."

His jaw tightened, but his thoughts? Oh, they were deliciously conflicted.

"Why does she have to be so infuriating? And why can’t I stop thinking about that damn dress she wore last week? Focus, Nathan. She’s your business partner, not your—"

Evelyn bit her lip to suppress a grin. Oh, this is going to be fun.

The board meeting was a bore, but the mental commentary? Pure gold. Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, was mentally dissecting everyone’s outfits while maintaining a perfectly composed exterior.

"That tie is atrocious. And her skirt is two inches too short for a professional setting. Honestly, do these people own mirrors?"

Evelyn stifled a laugh, earning a curious glance from Nathan.

Then came the pièce de résistance—Sophia Blackwood’s unexpected appearance. Nathan’s sister swept in, all smiles, but her mind was a whirlwind of chaos.

"Why did Daniel have to pick today to fight about the prenup? And why is Nathan glaring at me? Does he know about the embezzlement? No, calm down. He can’t possibly—"

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Oh. My. God.

She leaned back in her chair, sipping her water with feigned nonchalance. This was better than reality TV.

By lunch, Evelyn’s head was spinning with secrets. She retreated to her office, locking the door behind her.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Nathan’s voice was low, edged with something unreadable.

She schooled her expression before opening the door. "Yes?"

He stepped inside, closing the door with a soft click. "We need to talk."

Her pulse spiked. "About what? Does he know? Did someone see me—"

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "Stop reading my mind."

Evelyn froze.

Wait. What?

His lips curved into a smirk. "You heard me."

Her breath caught. "How the hell—"

"Because," he said, stepping closer, "I can read yours too."

Evelyn's meticulously crafted scheme came to an abrupt halt when strong arms encircled her without warning. Before she could protest, Nathan's deep baritone rumbled against her ear. "My apologies. This is entirely my fault."


The crowd gasped as Nathan Blackwood, known for his icy composure, not only pulled Evelyn Sinclair into an embrace but actually apologized. The scene grew more surreal when Lillian spoke up. "Nathan, you needn't apologize for her. She should answer for her own actions."

Memories surfaced of two years prior when Nathan had similarly apologized on Evelyn's behalf during one of her infamous outbursts. The spectators naturally assumed history was repeating itself.

But then Nathan did the unthinkable. He tilted Evelyn's chin upward, meeting her wide, startled eyes, and murmured words that shattered everyone's expectations: "Forgive me for making you the subject of misunderstanding."

Evelyn's mind short-circuited. Is he... apologizing to me? Since when did English become this difficult to comprehend? The bewildered expression she wore only seemed to amuse Nathan further.

Turning to the assembled crowd, Nathan declared, "That email was sent using my wife's name without her knowledge."

The statement landed like a grenade. Cassandra was first to recover. "Nathan, even to protect her, you can't possibly—"

Nathan's discomfort was palpable, yet he pressed on. "When you emailed requesting a meeting, my wife intercepted it first and immediately brought it to my attention. However..." He paused, jaw tightening. "I believed responding personally would imply inappropriate contact with an ex. To honor my current relationship, I asked my wife to reply on my behalf. But..."

His gaze dropped to Evelyn again, one eyebrow quirking in exasperation. "Since my wife refused to assist, I had no choice but to handle it myself."

Evelyn's mouth fell open. Around them, jaws hit the floor. Those who knew Nathan understood he'd rather walk barefoot on broken glass than lie. Yet the idea of the formidable Nathan Blackwood crafting such a petty email was... unthinkable. It was juvenile. Beneath him. An absolute character assassination.

The mental image of their unshakable business titan reduced to such behavior made several attendees clutch their pearls. His staunchest admirers looked particularly shell-shocked.

Under the weight of their stares, Nathan actually broke into a sweat. For perhaps the first time in his adult life, he wished the earth would swallow him whole. But having made his bed, he had no choice but to lie in it.

His arms tightened reflexively around Evelyn, as if she alone could anchor him through this storm of his own making.

"Evelyn, how could you do something like this? Oh Nathan, don't be angry with Evelyn. Still, this is quite unfair to Cassandra. Perhaps an apology is in order?" Claire suggested with feigned concern.

"No need. It's my fault. I shouldn't have reached out to Nathan. Evelyn, you did what was necessary." Cassandra's voice trembled slightly, thick with unshed tears as she addressed Evelyn. "I did as you asked and haven't contacted Nathan since. But this is a reunion—I didn't want to come at first, but it's been so long since I've seen everyone, and I missed them. That's why I'm here. You don't need to worry about what Lila said. It's all in the past now."

"Cassandra, you're too forgiving! Who knows what schemes this woman has been weaving behind your backs to drive this wedge between you two!" Lila declared, as if the matter were already settled.

My native language may be silence, but isn't their performance a tad too dramatic? Evelyn mused. I love gossip as much as the next person, but it stops being fun when I'm the one being dragged through the mud.

Snapped back to reality by the sheer absurdity of the situation, Nathan found himself in uncharted territory—a humiliating scenario he'd never experienced before. Heat crawled up his neck, his entire body burning with discomfort.

It dawned on him that he would never understand the labyrinth of a woman's mind. He hadn't anticipated that the email would be weaponized against Evelyn.

For the first time in his life, he truly grasped the meaning of embarrassment.

Just as he moved to stand and clarify, Evelyn's inner monologue erupted like a storm. I don’t even need to dig to know they fabricated this whole thing to frame me. They’re dead set on winning Nathan over.

Nathan mentally countered, Actually, that’s not—

Evelyn's thoughts barreled on. I’ll make sure they regret crossing me! Now, how should I put them in their place?

No need, Nathan interjected silently. I’ll handle it.

A faint smirk curled Evelyn’s lips. Wait—if I retaliate now without Nathan’s backing, I’ll just look like the villain. But… this could be an opportunity. If I play along, weakly deny everything, and let Nathan doubt me—especially since they’ve put on such a convincing act—then I can escalate this into a full-blown argument. Things will spiral, and then… Hehehe…

Nathan barely suppressed an eye roll. Yes, I suppose it is an opportunity.

Abruptly, Evelyn rose to her feet, resolve flashing in her eyes.

But before she could speak, Nathan stood as well. In one swift motion, he pulled her into his arms.

Lying. Did he truly do that? And why in the world would he use my name?

Others echoed the same question burning in Evelyn’s mind.

Unshaken by the potential humiliation, Nathan met Cassandra’s gaze head-on. His piercing stare seemed to strip away every pretense, laying bare the truth beneath.

Cassandra was still reeling from that earth-shattering revelation when his gaze sent an icy shiver down her spine. For the first time in her life, she felt the gnawing bite of guilt.

"Admittedly, my actions were partly fueled by irritation," Nathan admitted, his voice steady. "But I assumed any rational person would understand that responding in my wife’s name was a clear message—we are united, and outsiders should respect that boundary. Yet, somehow..." His words trailed off, but the unspoken accusation hung heavy in the air.

Even Lillian, who had been so bold moments ago, trembled, her lips parting and closing without a sound.

Nathan’s phrasing had been diplomatic, but the underlying meaning was razor-sharp.

Anyone with an ounce of dignity would have backed off after receiving such a warning. They wouldn’t entertain the idea of meddling in another’s marriage, much less flaunting their shamelessness.

Nathan had expected better from Cassandra.

Based on what he knew of her, she was supposed to be refined, principled—someone who understood propriety.

Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined she would team up with Lillian to dredge up this mess again.

Nathan laid out the facts with clinical precision, then turned to Evelyn, his expression softening with genuine remorse. "I’m sorry."

This was his oversight, and because of it, Evelyn had suffered undeserved consequences.

His gaze never wavered from hers, as if the opinions of everyone else in the room meant nothing.

Evelyn blinked at him, momentarily stunned. When their eyes met, a flicker of confusion crossed her face.

Then, she demanded sharply, "I’m filing for defamation damages. He’d better not think an apology is enough to make this go away."

Nathan exhaled, a faint smile tugging at his lips as he murmured, "Fair enough. Will ten million cover it?"

Evelyn’s eyes lit up instantly. She coughed, schooling her expression. "That... should suffice." Ten million for this? Please, let people slander me like this every day!

Nathan nearly choked hearing her thoughts.

If only I could sue Cassandra for emotional distress. Right now, Nathan could really use that money to soothe his wounded pride. The sheer audacity of this situation was mortifying—yet somehow, he’d managed to keep a straight face.

Does he think if he isn’t embarrassed, everyone else will be too?

Evelyn stifled a laugh.

Should I comfort him now? Or would he take it as mockery? Evelyn's thoughts swirled in turmoil.

Nathan's voice echoed in his mind, Thanks, but no need for pity. If you're forced to leave this cruel world...

...then maybe your consolation would just make me feel worse.

The others remained oblivious to the silent exchange between the two, too absorbed in processing the bombshell revelation.

The gossip-loving classmates could swear that in all the gatherings they'd attended, they'd never witnessed such a jaw-dropping spectacle unfold live before their eyes. The twists were explosive, the drama—unreal.

Now that the truth was laid bare, the way everyone looked at Cassandra and Lillian had shifted drastically.

Just moments ago, the two had been busy spinning tales about Evelyn's so-called wicked schemes. Yet, in the end, they were the ones exposed, shattering the pristine image of the once-beloved campus sweetheart.

So when Cassandra's face twisted in misery now, it only came across as painfully insincere.

Whispers spread like wildfire.

Cassandra couldn't take it anymore, but pride kept her chin high. This time, her sobs were louder—a desperate bid for sympathy, a stalling tactic. Her mind was in chaos, unable to comprehend how things had spiraled so far out of control.

Lillian, however, was unraveling. Though hopelessly infatuated with Nathan, her own insecurities had kept her from ever pursuing him. Watching Cassandra and Nathan together, she had convinced herself that only someone as beautiful, intelligent, and accomplished as Cassandra deserved him—not Evelyn, who she believed had schemed her way into his heart.

After all, if Evelyn could succeed like that, why couldn't she have done the same to become Mrs. Blackwood? The thought of Nathan defending Evelyn—calling her his wife—was unbearable.

"Nathan," Lillian cried, voice trembling, "have you forgotten that Cassandra was your first love? Have you forgotten what you two shared? How can you say you feel nothing for her?" She let out a bitter laugh. "Oh, I see. You're just too honorable to abandon Evelyn now. You're only fulfilling your duty as a husband, but deep down, Cassandra still holds a piece of your heart!"

Frantically, she tried to pull Cassandra up. "Cassandra, ask him! Make him admit it!"

Cassandra knew the situation was dire. But she wasn’t ready to lose any more dignity. Maybe it was better to retreat now and fight another day.

The rest of the table stayed silent, too afraid to speculate further.

Reluctant as they were to admit it, Nathan’s treatment of Evelyn was different—especially compared to how he’d once treated Cassandra.

Nathan’s gaze settled on Lillian, cool and assessing. After a beat, he spoke. "Have you been binge-watching too many dramas? I never had a first love."

After hearing Evelyn complain about that phrase one too many times, he’d grown sick of it—because it implied lingering feelings where there were none.

But those words struck Cassandra like a physical blow. It was as if her entire history with him had been erased. Her breath hitched, her composure crumbling. She couldn’t—

The air between them crackled with tension as Evelyn struggled to process Nathan's words. Her fingers trembled slightly as she clutched her purse, her voice barely above a whisper. "Nathan, you're cruel. How can you dismiss what we had so easily?"

A cold glint flashed in Nathan's eyes as he regarded her with detached indifference. "I never said you were my first love, nor did I ever feel that way," he stated flatly. "You were simply someone I dated. We ended things civilly, and both of us moved on. That's all there was to it."

His expression darkened as he continued, his tone sharpening. "But I do owe you an apology. It wasn't until recently that I realized I never truly loved you. Starting a relationship without being sure of my feelings was a mistake—one I won't repeat."

Evelyn's breath hitched as his words struck like a blade.

Nathan exhaled, his patience thinning. "Since it was a mistake from the beginning, there's no reason to revisit it. So, for the sake of my wife and me, I’d appreciate it if you—and your friends—stopped these pointless games. You've already caused enough trouble."

The finality in his voice left no room for argument.

###Chapter 195 Fairy Tales Of Love Are All Lies

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the plush carpet of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse as she clutched her phone, her knuckles white. The headline glared back at her: Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Mystery Woman at Exclusive Gala—Who Is She?

Her chest tightened.

Just last night, Nathan had whispered promises against her skin, his lips tracing the curve of her shoulder. "You're the only one, Evelyn."

And now this.

A knock at the door startled her. Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant, stepped in, her expression grim. "You’ve seen the news?"

Evelyn forced a laugh, brittle as glass. "Hard to miss."

Lillian hesitated. "There’s more. The woman—she’s not just anyone. It’s Vanessa Sterling."

The name struck like a blade. Harrison Montgomery’s mistress. The same woman tangled in last year’s explosive cheating scandal.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed—Nathan. Again.

She swiped to ignore, her mind racing. Was this his way of punishing her for refusing to move in with him? Or worse—had she been a fool all along?

Across town, Nathan Blackwood paced his office, his usual composure shattered. "Damn it, Marcus," he growled at his agent. "How did this leak?"

Marcus Donovan exhaled sharply. "Paparazzi got lucky. But that’s not the real problem. Vanessa’s claiming you two had a private conversation. About Evelyn."

Nathan’s blood ran cold.

Because the truth was far worse than a staged photo.

Vanessa had approached him—with an ultimatum. "Leave Evelyn, or I’ll expose what really happened in Monte Carlo."

And that secret could destroy everything.

Evelyn’s phone lit up with an unknown number. The message was brief:

"Ask Nathan about the fire. Then decide if he’s worth your heart."

The screen blurred as her vision swam.

Somewhere, a clock was ticking.

And love might not survive the truth.

Nathan Blackwood's declaration hung heavy in the air, plunging the entire table into stunned silence.

For a long moment, Cassandra trembled, her wide eyes locked on Nathan in disbelief. She had never expected him to dismiss their past so coldly.

The implications were crystal clear—she had never been his first love, and their relationship had never been the bittersweet romance everyone imagined. It was all just an illusion, a story spun by whispers and wishful thinking.

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room. If this was the truth, then what else had been fabricated? Had everything they thought they knew about Nathan and Cassandra been nothing more than a carefully constructed lie?

The murmurs spread like wildfire. Guests at nearby tables leaned in, exchanging hushed whispers.

"Wait… so their whole 'perfect couple' image was just gossip?"

"Now that I think about it, I don’t remember ever seeing them actually together on campus. No hand-holding, no stolen kisses—nothing."

"Nathan never even looked heartbroken after their breakup. I thought he was just good at hiding it, but… he really didn’t care?"

"All those love stories we believed in—they were just fairy tales. I feel so stupid."

Even Evelyn Sinclair couldn’t hold back her shock. Had Nathan truly never loved Cassandra? Were all the dramatic details Victoria Hayes had shared just fabrications? Had she, too, been fooled by the rumors? No wonder the rest of the Blackwood family rarely mentioned Cassandra. They probably knew the truth all along—that Nathan had never been serious about her.

Nathan paused, realization dawning on him. So this is why Evelyn stubbornly believed Cassandra was my first love and that our marriage was doomed. Even when I tried to explain, she pretended to believe me, but deep down, she was convinced I was lying. Victoria must have fed her endless gossip, painting Cassandra as his tragic lost love. And Evelyn, with her vivid imagination, had taken those stories and run with them.

But the truth was far simpler—he had never loved Cassandra. Not then, not now.

What a colossal misunderstanding. Evelyn’s mind reeled. Does this mean the drama I’ve been waiting for… never even existed?

A slow, satisfied smirk curved Nathan’s lips as relief washed over him.

Around the table, stunned faces turned from Nathan to Cassandra, struggling to process the truth.

Nathan’s gaze swept over them, his expression firm. This wasn’t just about correcting the past—it was about making one thing undeniably clear.

He was defending Evelyn. And he wouldn’t let anyone—especially not Cassandra—twist the truth again.

In the past, Nathan had only fulfilled his obligations toward Evelyn in a detached, mechanical manner—something his inner circle could easily discern. While they weren't openly hostile toward her, their indifference spoke volumes. After all, she was the woman who had manipulated their closest friend. Even if Cassandra had never existed, they wouldn’t have shown Evelyn any genuine respect.

Yet when Nathan reappeared in such a formal setting with Evelyn at his side, the message was unmistakable: she mattered to him now.

As his friends, they had no choice but to acknowledge her.

The group’s reactions varied—some were stunned, others remained composed, and a few had seen it coming all along.

Then there were those who refused to accept it, like Claire.

Evelyn had, after all, recently crossed Claire.

Watching as Lillian and Cassandra stood frozen in shock, Claire gritted her teeth at their uselessness.

"Nathan," Claire snapped, her voice sharp with accusation, "this is too much. Even if you’re bound to this marriage now, you can’t just erase what you once felt for Cassandra—"

Nathan’s brow furrowed slightly, his interruption swift and cutting. "There’s nothing to erase. What never existed can’t be rewritten. If you insist otherwise, enlighten me. Name one moment worth remembering."

Claire faltered, unprepared for his blunt dismissal. Even Mason, ever the mediator, shot her a warning glance. Nathan’s stance was crystal clear.

When Lillian finally found her voice, it came out shrill. "How can you deny it? You adored Cassandra! Look at this—" She thrust her phone forward, displaying a photo of Nathan beneath a snow-dusted streetlamp, his gaze fixed on Cassandra as she ran toward him.

Nathan felt Evelyn shift in his arms.

Truthfully, he’d only embraced her briefly at the start, but even now, he sensed the subtle tension in her posture.

Evelyn’s emotions might have been in turmoil, but curiosity won out. Gossip was her guilty pleasure—ignoring it would’ve been unnatural.

She leaned in, studying the photo with undisguised interest.

"Stop!" Cassandra’s voice cracked through the room, raw and desperate. Her breath came in shallow gasps, her lashes trembling as she lifted her tear-streaked face to Nathan. For once, her anguish wasn’t performative—it was real, and it was devastating.

Evelyn arched a brow, impressed. Damn, she’s good. If the whole heiress thing falls through, Hollywood’s waiting.

Violet quieted down, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Evelyn, we have to confront him!"

Evelyn forced herself to remain composed, drawing in a slow, steadying breath.

Here we go again. Another dramatic performance. How will she twist this situation to her advantage? I’ll just sit back and enjoy the show. Action! thought Seraphina, her amusement nearly making Nathan chuckle in the tense atmosphere.

Clearly, he wasn’t cut out for theatrics.

Then, Evelyn spoke, her voice trembling just enough to sound wounded. "There’s no need. Mr. Blackwood is right. It was all in my head. I was deluding myself, believing in something that was never real."

The crowd’s expressions shifted, sympathy flickering in their eyes.

But Nathan had run out of patience.

"It was you who crafted those rumors," he said, his voice cutting through the murmurs. "Spreading tales of us being the perfect match, the golden couple of high society. You paraded our so-called love in front of everyone, shaping an image that never existed. At the time, I didn’t care—whether it was for your pride or your family’s benefit, it didn’t matter. But now?" His gaze hardened. "Your vague insinuations, your calculated words—they’re poisoning the relationship between my wife and me. And I won’t let you paint us as the villains."

Evelyn’s lips parted, her eyes welling up.

Nathan’s stare only grew colder. "That look, those tears—you’re hoping the crowd will draw the conclusion you want. Do you really think I’m that blind?"

Evelyn stiffened, her breath hitching. Reality crashed over her. The man before her wasn’t just any businessman—he was Nathan Blackwood, a titan who had never lost a battle. How had she ever thought he wouldn’t see through her?

The onlookers blinked, realization dawning. The narrative they’d almost accepted was completely at odds with Nathan’s words.

"Our relationship was amicable, but it was never the grand romance the rumors made it out to be," Nathan stated, his tone unwavering. He didn’t spare Evelyn another glance, turning instead to a stunned Violet and the phone in her hand. "Where did this photo come from?"

###Chapter 196 You Are Talented

Whispers in Evelyn's Mind

The morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair's bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still lingering on the dream she’d had—something about Nathan Blackwood and a scandalous secret.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. With a sigh, she grabbed it, blinking at the flood of notifications.

Trending Now: Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Mystery Woman at Midnight Gala!

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Her thumb hovered over the headline, torn between curiosity and dread. She shouldn’t care. Nathan was just her boss—well, former boss—and their relationship had always been strictly professional. Mostly.

She clicked.

The article unfolded with a grainy photo of Nathan, his signature smirk in place, standing too close to a stunning brunette in a backless emerald gown. The caption read: "Nathan Blackwood and rising starlet Seraphina Delacroix share an intimate moment at the exclusive Black & Gold Gala. Sources say sparks flew all night!"

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Seraphina Delacroix—the same actress who’d been linked to Sebastian Hart just weeks ago. The woman had a reputation for leaving broken hearts (and broken contracts) in her wake.

She scrolled further, her pulse quickening.

"Insiders claim Nathan and Seraphina have been secretly seeing each other for months. Could this be the reason behind his sudden split from business partner Victoria Hayes?"

Evelyn scoffed. Victoria Hayes had been a viper in designer heels, but even she didn’t deserve to be blindsided like this.

A knock at her door startled her. "Evelyn? You decent?" Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant, peeked in, balancing a coffee tray. "You’ve got that look again."

"What look?" Evelyn tossed her phone aside.

"The 'I just read something that ruined my morning' look." Lillian set the coffee down and eyed the discarded phone. "Let me guess—Nathan’s latest escapade?"

Evelyn groaned. "Is it that obvious?"

"Only to people who know you." Lillian smirked. "So, what’s the damage this time?"

Evelyn hesitated. "He was at some gala with Seraphina Delacroix. The press is spinning it like they’re some epic love story."

Lillian snorted. "Please. That woman changes men faster than she changes nail polish." She leaned in conspiratorially. "But between us? Nathan’s been acting weird lately. Like, weirder than usual."

Evelyn frowned. "Weird how?"

"Canceled three meetings last week. Showed up to the office at 2 AM. And get this—he asked Preston Whitmore to fast-track your script revisions."

Evelyn’s heart skipped. "He did what?"

"Mm-hmm." Lillian sipped her coffee. "Almost like someone’s desperate to keep you around."

Evelyn opened her mouth to retort when her phone buzzed again. A text notification lit up the screen:

Unknown Number: We need to talk. It’s about Nathan. Meet me at The Velvet Hour. Noon.

She stared at the message, her fingers trembling. Who the hell was this? And what did they know about Nathan?

Lillian raised a brow. "Trouble?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Or the start of it."

Nathan Blackwood had never paid much attention to idle gossip before, so naturally, he was oblivious to the rumors. But now that they had been brought up in such a provoking manner—especially since Evelyn Sinclair’s curiosity had been piqued—he felt compelled to clarify the truth.

Everyone had seen that infamous photograph, and of course, they had all heard the story behind it.

In truth, Daniel Wright had already fully believed Nathan’s words. Though it was difficult to admit—because the truth was painful—it had indeed been Cassandra and her clique who had stirred up trouble first. If Nathan didn’t stand up for those he cared about now, he wouldn’t be Nathan Blackwood. After all, the Blackwood family was notorious for fiercely protecting their own.

There was no denying it—Nathan now considered Evelyn someone he deeply cherished.

"They said you were burning up with fever, delirious and desperate to see Cassandra. In your confusion, you went looking for her but couldn’t find her, so you ended up waiting beneath a streetlamp until Cassandra finally came to get you."

As Daniel  speaking, the panic on Cassandra’s face was unmistakable.

When others had questioned her about it before, she had merely smiled coyly, never denying the rumors. Everyone had witnessed it, so they had always assumed…

Meanwhile, the corner of Nathan’s mouth twitched in irritation.

"I remember now. It was Christmas Eve when you went to the hospital and didn’t return until late the next night. And when you did, you came back with Cassandra—still feverish." Marcus Prescott, as Nathan’s roommate, couldn’t help but state the facts, though he believed Nathan’s version of events.

Hearing Marcus’s words, something seemed to click in Nathan’s mind. His brows furrowed, and he turned to look at Evelyn. For a moment, he was at a loss for words.

Evelyn blinked. Why is he looking at me like that? This couldn’t possibly have anything to do with me, could it?

With a sigh, Nathan finally spoke. "Do you remember when you were fifteen and fainted on your first day at my house? You ended up in the hospital—on Christmas Day."

Of course, everyone present knew the story—how the Blackwood family had taken Evelyn in after her parents passed, leaving her orphaned.

Evelyn was well aware of the original host’s memories. But faced with Nathan’s sudden recollection, she felt oddly exposed and could only nod. "I think so."

Nathan turned back to the others and explained, "That day, our parents were worried sick, so they asked all of us siblings to stay at the hospital. That’s why I was there the entire day. When I returned the next night, I wasn’t looking for Cassandra. I was just heading back to the dorm when I ran into her. As for standing under the streetlight… I was just lost in thought."

Now, Nathan remembered the real reason he had lingered in the snow that night—he had been thinking about Evelyn.

That day, Evelyn had woken up in the hospital bed and suddenly whispered to them, "I’m sorry… and thank you."

The words had haunted him ever since.

Nathan Blackwood had never paid attention to those ridiculous rumors before, so naturally, he was clueless. But the way they brought it up—so irritatingly, sparking Evelyn Sinclair’s curiosity—left him no choice but to set the record straight.

Everyone had seen that photograph. And of course, they’d all heard the story behind it.

Truthfully, Daniel Wright had already believed Nathan’s words. Though it pained him to admit it, Cassandra and her little clique had started the mess. If Nathan didn’t stand up for those he cared about now, he wouldn’t be Nathan Blackwood. The Blackwoods were notorious for protecting their own.

And there was no denying it—Nathan considered Evelyn someone he deeply cherished.

“They said you were burning up with fever, delirious, desperate to see Cassandra. In your confusion, you went looking for her but couldn’t find her, so you waited under a streetlight until she finally came for you.”

As Daniel  speaking, Cassandra’s panic was palpable.

When others had asked her about it before, she’d just smiled shyly, never denying it. Everyone had seen it, so they’d all assumed…

Meanwhile, Nathan’s lips twitched in irritation.

“I remember now. It was Christmas night—you went to the hospital and didn’t come back until the next evening. And when you did, you were still feverish… with Cassandra.” Marcus Prescott, as Nathan’s roommate, couldn’t help but state the facts, though he believed Nathan’s side.

At Marcus’s words, something clicked in Nathan’s mind. His brows furrowed as he turned to Evelyn, suddenly at a loss for words.

Evelyn blinked. Why is he looking at me like that? This can’t possibly involve me, right?

With a sigh, Nathan finally spoke. “Do you remember when you were fifteen? The first day you came to my house, you fainted and ended up in the hospital. It was Christmas.”

Of course, everyone present knew the story—how the Blackwoods had taken in Evelyn after her parents’ tragic accident left her orphaned.

Evelyn knew the original host’s memories well enough. But under Nathan’s intense gaze, she felt oddly exposed and could only nod. “I think so.”

Nathan turned back to the others. “That day, our parents were worried sick. They made all of us stay at the hospital with them. That’s why I was there the whole time. When I got back the next night, I wasn’t looking for Cassandra. I was just heading back to the dorm when I ran into her. And as for standing under the streetlight… I was just lost in thought.”

Now, he remembered.

That snowy night, he’d lingered beneath the flickering streetlamp because his mind had been consumed by her—Evelyn.

That day, when she’d woken up in the hospital bed, she’d looked at them all and whispered, “I’m sorry… and thank you.”

The words had haunted him ever since.

At that moment, Evelyn's expression was utterly unreadable to him. When she murmured about being exhausted and needing to close her eyes to rest, it felt as if half his heart had been carved out in an instant.

It wasn't until the next morning, when Evelyn finally stirred awake, that her vitality seemed to return. Yet, the way she kept stealing glances at him—suddenly, frequently—left Nathan inexplicably unsettled. So he fabricated an excuse and retreated to campus.

"I merely lost myself in thought for too long, which triggered the fever afterward. It wasn’t the other way around," Nathan stated coolly. "If you doubt me, the evidence is there for anyone to verify."

"Nathan..." Cassandra stood frozen, her lips parting in disbelief. How could he be this merciless? Knowing she’d fabricated everything, did their years of companionship mean nothing to him? Did he truly have to humiliate her publicly like this?

Even if he didn’t love her, surely their shared history counted for something?

But the dam of resentment finally broke. She nearly lunged at him—only to be pinned in place by his glacial stare.

"One staged photo to kick things off, and the rest was pure fiction? Even gossip columns wouldn’t dare spin tales this wild!" Evelyn’s voice cut through the tension like a knife. Though it was just an offhand remark, it ignited the powder keg.

The previously subdued scene erupted into chaos.

What a plot twist!

Evelyn bit her tongue too late. She’d been so absorbed in the drama that she’d accidentally poured gasoline on the fire. Instantly, she sealed her lips. In situations like this, spectators stayed safe; participants got shredded. And she much preferred the front-row view.

If not for Nathan’s interference, she’d probably have grabbed popcorn by now.

"I can’t believe it! This whole thing was a scam!"

"Wow, okay. Fake celebrity couples, fake real-life couples—do NPCs not deserve authentic love? Where’s the romance I signed up for?"

"This is why they say PDA curses relationships! Exhibit A!"

"Talk about self-sabotage. They were fine until Cassandra came back swinging—and ended up KO’ing herself."

"The irony! Two minutes ago, Lillian was preaching about ‘the unloved one being the homewrecker.’ So who’s the third wheel now?"

"Tsk, tsk. The way their fans’ faces must be melting right now—priceless."

The onslaught of whispers left Cassandra trembling.

Lillian had gone sheet-white, whirling on her. "Tell me he’s lying. Your ‘epic love story’ was all a lie?"

"You lied to me!"

Cassandra's lips trembled as the crushing realization hit her—there was no future with Nathan, and her carefully constructed image was about to shatter. She had to act fast to minimize the fallout.

Then, as if breaking under the weight of her own deception, Cassandra confessed, "Yes... I did it."

Her gaze flickered to Nathan, voice wavering. "Back then, even though you agreed to be with me, you were always so distant. What was I supposed to do? I loved you, so I lied—to myself, to everyone. And the more people believed in us, the more I was trapped. I never corrected them... I thought you had accepted it too. But now? You humiliate me in front of everyone. How could you be so cruel?"

A sob escaped her. "I convinced myself you were just reserved, that deep down, you wanted me too. I even left because I couldn’t bear the thought of you wasting your life waiting for me while I was sick. And now that I’ve returned... this is how you treat me?"

The raw emotion in her voice silenced the murmurs around them. The crowd watched, some expressions softening, their earlier mockery fading.

"That’s... harsh."

"Cassandra was just blinded by love. It’s tragic, really. She left because of illness, clung to hope, and came back only to have her heart broken."

"I get it. There were always whispers that Evelyn didn’t really earn her place. Cassandra just wanted to reclaim what was hers. Can you blame her? She probably never expected them to be this happy together."

If I didn’t know the truth, I’d pity her too.

Honestly, whether in PR or acting, she’d be a star. But I can’t let her flip this narrative.

Evelyn considered pressing Cassandra about her supposed illness—demanding proof. But before she could, Nathan stepped in, his voice cutting through the tension like ice.

"Funny. Before you left, you participated in our class’s health check-up—held at Blackwood Group’s private hospital. Since you were my girlfriend then, someone showed me your results. You were perfectly healthy. So tell me, did you suddenly develop a fatal condition in two days?"

The color drained from Cassandra’s face.

Did that... really happen?

She’d been so busy back then, drowning in preparations. But Nathan’s certainty sent a chill down her spine.

It’s over.

###Chapter 197 Taking A Jab At Nathan

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting a golden glow over the sleek modern furnishings. She stretched lazily, her silk nightgown slipping off one shoulder as she reached for her phone. The screen lit up with a barrage of notifications—mostly from her agent, Serena Whitmore, and a few from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Evelyn sighed, scrolling through the messages. The press had gotten wind of her latest project with Nathan Blackwood, and the rumors were spiraling out of control. "Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood: More Than Just Co-Stars?" one headline screamed. She rolled her eyes. The media loved to twist every interaction into a scandal.

She tapped out a quick reply to Serena: "Tell them to focus on the film, not fabricated drama."

Just as she set her phone down, it buzzed again—this time with a direct message from Nathan himself.

"You awake? We need to talk."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathan wasn’t one for casual texts, especially not this early. She typed back: "About?"

His reply was immediate. "The script changes. And… other things."

Before she could respond, another message popped up—this one from Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary. "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence at his office at 10 AM. Don’t be late."

Evelyn scoffed. Victoria had never been subtle about her disdain for her. Still, curiosity gnawed at her. What "other things" did Nathan want to discuss?

She dressed quickly, opting for a tailored blazer and fitted trousers—professional yet effortlessly chic. As she stepped into the elevator, her reflection stared back at her: determined, composed, but with a flicker of something else—anticipation?

Nathan’s office was all sleek glass and polished steel, a reflection of the man himself: controlled, imposing, and impossible to ignore. He stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back to her, the cityscape stretching endlessly behind him.

"You wanted to talk?" Evelyn said, crossing her arms.

Nathan turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "The studio wants to add a love scene."

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"Page 78. They think it’ll ‘heighten the tension.’" His tone was dry, but his jaw tightened slightly.

She exhaled sharply. "Of course they do."

A beat of silence passed between them, charged with something unspoken. Then Nathan stepped closer, his voice dropping. "There’s something else."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Which is?"

He hesitated—uncharacteristic for a man who always knew exactly what to say. "I need you to trust me."

Before she could demand an explanation, the door swung open, and Victoria strode in, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "Your next meeting starts in five, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan’s expression shuttered, the moment broken. "We’ll continue this later," he murmured, his eyes never leaving Evelyn’s.

She nodded, though unease coiled in her stomach. Whatever he wasn’t saying, it was big.

And she had a feeling it would change everything.

The golden chandeliers cast shimmering reflections across the ballroom as whispers slithered through the crowd like snakes. Nathan Blackwood had always carried himself with unshakable integrity—no scandals, no deceit, nothing to tarnish his polished reputation. So when he dropped the bombshell, Evelyn Sinclair watched as Cassandra’s carefully constructed facade crumbled in real time.

Evelyn had expected to step in, to defend, to counterattack—but Nathan had seized control of the narrative before she could even blink.

He knew.

The realization struck her like lightning. All this time, he had been aware of Cassandra’s lies. The staged illness, the dramatic breakup, the self-imposed exile abroad—none of it had fooled him.

And now, he was dismantling her deception in front of everyone.

“Are you suggesting the illness was a sham?” Daniel Wright, ever the quick-witted observer, voiced what the entire room was thinking.

Nathan’s gaze never wavered from Cassandra’s paling face. She looked like a cornered animal, her breath coming in shallow gasps as the murmurs around them crescendoed into a storm.

“Fake?” someone hissed.

“I never heard about her being sick. Even if it was kept quiet, there would’ve been some rumor.”

“She went abroad to study, didn’t she? The Smiths shifted their business overseas with her.”

“Exactly! It was all about expanding their empire, not some tragic illness.”

Laughter, sharp and mocking, rippled through the crowd.

“Oh, this is rich,” a woman sneered. “Breaking up over a terminal illness, fleeing the country—straight out of a telenovela.”

“Too bad Nathan refused to play the grieving lover.”

Cassandra’s fingers dug into the tablecloth, her knuckles white. The weight of their judgment pressed down on her, suffocating.

Evelyn watched, stunned. Nathan had orchestrated this moment perfectly. He hadn’t just exposed Cassandra—he’d humiliated her.

And the best part?

He hadn’t even needed her help.

A slow smirk curled Evelyn’s lips.

Tsk, tsk. You really thought you could manipulate him, didn’t you?

Nathan had let Cassandra spin her web, allowed her to believe she still held power over him. But the moment she tried to use that fabricated illness to guilt him, to control him—he’d struck back with surgical precision.

The crowd buzzed, hungry for the final act.

“So if she wasn’t sick,” Daniel mused, eyes gleaming with amusement, “why the dramatic exit?”

Nathan’s smile was ice.

“That,” he said softly, “is the real question.”

The room held its breath.

And Cassandra?

She had no answer.

Karma had come full circle, and it was a sight to behold.

“What in the world is happening? Cassandra, are you lying to us?”

Vivian Grant couldn’t hold back her outburst. As someone who wore her heart on her sleeve, she had been genuinely concerned for Cassandra, even drowning in guilt for not reaching out after Cassandra had gone silent.

Now, faced with the possibility that it had all been a lie, Vivian was furious.

Beatrice Holloway, who had mostly stayed out of the conversation until now, couldn’t hide her irritation. “Cassandra, how could you fabricate something so serious?”

Claire Morgan’s brows knitted together in worry. Though she agreed with Nathan, she still voiced her doubts. “Cassandra, could there be a misunderstanding? Lillian mentioned you stayed at a nursing home, didn’t she?”

Lillian Graves, who had been pushed to the edge by the collapse of her favorite couple, clenched her jaw. It felt like she was betraying her own devotion. She suddenly grabbed Cassandra’s arm, demanding, “You were really sick, weren’t you? You left because you loved Nathan too much to let him see you suffer, right? And now you’re cured—that’s why you came back to him, isn’t it?”

If this narrative held, there might still be hope for Nathan and Cassandra.

That way, Lillian could keep rooting for them.

Cassandra knew she couldn’t admit the truth. Spreading rumors could be dismissed as a desperate act of love, but faking an illness? That would ruin her reputation beyond repair.

“Of course it’s true. Why would I lie about something like this? If I wasn’t sick, why would I have broken up with Nathan?” Cassandra’s voice trembled with emotion, her eyes brimming with despair as she looked at Nathan.

“I don’t remember any school medical check-up. I had my tests done privately with my family, and that’s when we found out. After that, I went through multiple confirmations. I took so many leaves—my mood was terrible. Anyone who remembers would know. Maybe… maybe the school’s records were wrong.” The more she spoke, the more confident she sounded. “And it’s true—I spent years in a nursing home. All of this can be verified. It’s just confidential patient information.”

Lillian finally exhaled in relief and turned to Nathan. “Nathan, you heard her. I knew you must have misunderstood. That’s why you treated her like this today. If you don’t believe her, check the nursing home records!”

Lillian was certain. She had studied in that country too.

This counterargument sent ripples of doubt through the room. Could it really have been a misunderstanding?

Had Nathan gotten it wrong? Was that why he had been so harsh today?

Is Cassandra really turning this around against all odds? Even if it was a stretch, her sheer audacity was impressive.

Nathan’s brows furrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected Cassandra to be this shameless—still clinging to her lies even now.

The truth was within reach, but exposing Cassandra's lies would require tedious effort. Nathan knew it couldn't be done tonight.

His only option was to force her to produce a medical examination report. Grace Nursing Home in Astoria was notoriously exclusive, catering only to the elite. Nathan had no way to verify what had truly happened there.

Cassandra had stayed there years ago when she was nearly engaged in a secret marriage alliance. She had been assigned to care for an elderly patient of that family, hoping to win their favor. That was why she had remained there so long. But since the engagement was kept under wraps to avoid sabotage, the public only knew one thing—Cassandra had lived in a nursing home.

And who would stay in a nursing home without reason? Naturally, people assumed she had been ill.

Clever. Cassandra was undeniably sharp—just not in the ways that mattered. Her schemes were nearly flawless, leaving no room for error. But Evelyn was the glitch in her plans, the one who had unraveled everything tonight.

This is as far as we can go...

A flicker of disappointment passed through Evelyn. It was like watching a poorly written drama unfold.

The guests murmured in confusion, uncertain what to believe.

Seeing Nathan’s silence, Cassandra finally exhaled in relief. Had he somehow gotten her medical records? Was that why he had doubted her tonight? Maybe he still cared after all.

Hope flared in her chest, and she gazed at him with wounded eyes. "No matter what, I broke up with you because I loved you. I’m not the kind of woman who uses love as a weapon, who traps someone regardless of their feelings..."

A ripple of tension passed through the crowd.

Oh, so now you’re taking a jab at me? Evelyn’s lips curled. Feeling bold because you think you’ve won? Believe me, I can have you dragged to a hospital for a full examination in seconds.

But before Cassandra could fully play the victim and salvage her image, Nathan’s icy stare silenced her.

He pulled out his phone and dialed.

His assistant answered immediately.

"Contact Grace Nursing Home in Astoria," Nathan ordered, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade.


###Chapter 198 The Truth Is Revealed

Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her latte, scrolling absently through her phone, when an unexpected notification popped up—a message from her assistant, Lillian Graves.

"You won’t believe what I just overheard."

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen. Lillian wasn’t one for dramatics, so if she was intrigued, it had to be good.

Lillian: Nathan Blackwood’s sister, Sophia, just had a screaming match with her husband, Daniel Prescott, in the middle of the Blackwood Enterprises lobby. Something about a mistress named Adriana?

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Adriana? That name rang a bell—wasn’t she the same woman Daniel had introduced as his "business associate" at last month’s gala?

Her phone buzzed again.

Lillian: And get this—Sophia stormed out, shouting that she’d expose Daniel’s entire family if he didn’t cut ties with Adriana by tonight.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a smirk. The Blackwood family drama was always delicious, but this? This was juicy.

Before she could reply, another message lit up her screen—this time from Preston Whitmore, her agent.

Preston: Emergency meeting at the studio. Harrison Montgomery’s wife, Natalie Whitaker, just filed for divorce. Rumor has it she caught him with Vanessa Sterling in their penthouse.

Evelyn’s eyebrows shot up. Harrison Montgomery—Hollywood’s golden boy—caught cheating? The media frenzy would be brutal.

She quickly typed back: On my way.

As she grabbed her coat, her phone buzzed again.

Unknown Number: You might want to check the security footage from last night’s charity event. Someone’s been keeping secrets.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Who was this? And what secrets?

She hesitated, then tapped out a reply: Who is this?

The response was instant.

Unknown Number: Let’s just say… you’re not the only one who can read minds.

A chill slithered down her spine.

Was this a threat? A joke? Or—

Her phone rang, startling her. The caller ID flashed: Nathan Blackwood.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Of course he’d call now.

She swiped to answer, her voice deliberately light. "Nathan. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

His tone was ice. "We need to talk. Now."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. Whatever was coming, it wasn’t good.

And she had a sinking feeling the real drama was just beginning.

Evelyn stared at Nathan in utter disbelief.

The room fell into stunned silence. Even as the CEO of Blackwood Enterprises, could Nathan truly wield such extensive influence overseas?

"Nathan, you're really going this far." Even the typically composed Lucas looked shocked. He can't possibly be serious about this.

Given the earlier conversation, Evelyn was certain the only information Nathan could uncover would confirm her stay at the nursing home. She wasn’t foolish enough to lie about something so easily verifiable.

This reckless move was unlike Nathan. It was impulsive—what if he couldn’t get an answer? Worse, what if the answer matched Evelyn’s claims? He’d be humiliating himself.

Since when did Nathan care so little about his own dignity?

Cassandra watched Nathan, confusion flickering in her eyes. She, too, thought his approach was rash. Wasn’t this indirectly proving Evelyn’s story?

Her mind raced, spiraling into wild speculation.

Does he truly believe Evelyn is lying? Is that why he’s treating her this way? Now he’s desperate to confirm the truth, and then…

Nathan shot her an irritated glare, as if reading her thoughts.

"Let’s wait for the call before jumping to conclusions," he said sharply, his tone laced with displeasure.

Noticing his darkening expression, Cassandra reined in her imagination.

Truthfully, he shouldn’t have resorted to such an aggressive tactic. Nathan never acted without certainty.

But Evelyn had just tried to manipulate him with her so-called deep affection, all while subtly dragging Cassandra into the mess as a comparison. If left unchecked, by the end of the night, rumors would spread—Evelyn’s undying love for Nathan, and Cassandra’s selfish rise to becoming his wife.

How could he stand by and let Evelyn target Cassandra like this?

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Evelyn hadn’t expected Nathan to doubt her to this extent. Her heart shattered.

Finally, reality crashed over her. Nathan had never loved her. And now, he wasn’t even sparing her basic courtesy.

Biting her lower lip, resentment burned inside her. Fine, let him ask. If Nathan confirms I stayed there, it’ll only prove my story further.

Tonight, Evelyn Sinclair was determined to cement her position as the pitiable victim.

The Sinclair family had retreated to their homeland, humiliated and broken. If she didn't maintain her carefully crafted image, it would reflect poorly on the entire family. A woman drowning in unrequited love always garnered more sympathy than one exposed as deceitful and manipulative.

This wasn’t just about her reputation—it was about the Sinclair family’s standing in high society.

When the time came, Nathan Blackwood would surely drown in guilt. Even if there had never been love between them, guilt could be a powerful motivator. She refused to believe she would lose to Cassandra, a woman with no pedigree, no connections, and nothing but empty charm.

Nathan’s phone rang. Though most assumed it wouldn’t change anything, curiosity still had everyone leaning in, waiting for the outcome.

Nathan switched to speakerphone without hesitation.

A customer service representative’s voice, speaking in a crisp foreign accent, filled the room.

Though it wasn’t Uprian, many in attendance understood it perfectly.

At first, Evelyn thought she wouldn’t comprehend a word—another frustrating disadvantage. But to her shock, the moment the words reached her ears, they translated effortlessly in her mind.

The thrill of understanding nearly eclipsed her excitement for the impending gossip.

For someone who had struggled with languages her entire life, this sudden fluency felt like unlocking a hidden skill.

But it was strange. Inheriting memories was one thing—inheriting language proficiency? That defied logic.

Still, gossip came first. Thanks to the original body’s unexpected gift, she now had a free language upgrade.

"Hello, Mr. Blackwood," the voice on the line began. "This is the General Services Department of Astoria’s Grace Nursing Home. How may we assist you?"

Nathan’s response was smooth, his foreign accent flawless. "I have a friend..."

The moment had arrived. Cassandra instinctively held her breath, mentally reviewing every detail to ensure nothing could go wrong.

"...who has contracted a rare illness and hopes to be admitted to your facility."

Silence.

Everyone blinked in confusion.

Wasn’t he supposed to ask if Cassandra had ever stayed there? What kind of question was this?

The staff member politely requested the patient’s details.

Nathan spun an elaborate tale about a childhood friend from his hometown.

The room watched, stunned, as he wove the lie with effortless conviction.

The crisp voice from the phone carried an unmistakable apology. "I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Blackwood, but our facility has strict policies. We exclusively serve nobility from Astoria. We cannot accommodate patients from other backgrounds."

Nathan's piercing gaze softened at once, a flicker of realization passing through his storm-gray eyes.

Among the gathered crowd, Roland—ever the sharp-eyed detective—was the first to react. His attention snapped toward Cassandra, suspicion darkening his expression.

Cassandra herself seemed to freeze, her delicate fingers tightening around her clutch. Her doe-like eyes widened, lips parting in silent horror, but it was too late to stop Nathan's next words.

His voice dropped to a dangerous timbre, laced with barely restrained fury as he addressed the staff member. "A Ms. Sinclair was a long-term resident at your institution. She personally confirmed this to me, and as far as I'm aware, she still holds our nation's citizenship. That's precisely why I sought your services for my associate. And now you claim it's impossible?" A cold chuckle. "I suggest your director provide me with an explanation—immediately."

Even elite establishments knew better than to provoke individuals of Nathan's standing—men whose influence spanned continents.

The staff member, already aware of Nathan's formidable reputation, scrambled to clarify. While patient confidentiality prevented medical disclosures, general information was fair game—especially when dealing with someone whose family name opened doors worldwide.

"Mr. Blackwood, allow me to clarify. There's no need to involve the director. Ms. Sinclair did reside with us for several years, but she wasn't a patient. She accompanied someone—a noble family member under our care. Our records show we've never treated any citizens from your country. Our policies are absolute—"

By then, the damning truth had already shattered the room.

She hadn't been a patient. She'd been a caretaker.

A murmur of disbelief rippled through the crowd.

"Good God—she lied!"

"Unbelievable! The audacity!"

"Wait—that staff said their patients are aristocrats. Since when does the Sinclair family rub shoulders with foreign nobility? What was their precious heiress doing there?"

A knowing gasp. "Oh! This reminds me of that scandal overseas—where she was tending to her fiancé's ailing mother. The rumors were vile."

"So you're saying... she was trying to marry into nobility? And that's why she played nurse?"

"Exactly! And clearly, it didn't work."

A scornful laugh. "No wonder she came crawling back—straight into Nathan's arms the moment she returned!"

The whispers crescendoed, each revelation stripping away Cassandra's carefully constructed facade.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable, but the tension in his jaw betrayed his fury. The woman he'd once loved—the one who'd claimed she'd been receiving elite treatment abroad—had been nothing more than a glorified servant.

And she'd dared to lie to him.

The game had just changed.

Evelyn clung to Nathan desperately, her fingers digging into his arms as if he were her only lifeline.

Dear readers, the truth has finally come to light!



The scandal was so explosive that the entire room erupted into chaos. Whispers turned into shouts, voices rising in shock and disbelief. Naturally, Evelyn heard every word.

Cassandra’s face turned deathly pale, her lips trembling as if she had just been struck by lightning. The moment this phone call ended, she knew—her fate was sealed.

There was no going back. No excuses left.

The damning truth about her had already spread like wildfire through the crowd, igniting a storm of judgment.

"So she was just using Nathan as a rebound? Settling for second best? Has she lost her mind?"

"If it weren’t for Nathan’s sharp instincts, he would’ve been dragged through the mud by her schemes. She’s absolutely ruthless!"

"What a performance! Cassandra really knows how to put on a show."

The most damning part? She had orchestrated everything. Had she stopped for even a second to reconsider, her true nature might never have been exposed. But now?

She had brought this upon herself.

Before Cassandra could even react, a sharp crack echoed through the room—a slap so forceful it silenced every other sound.

###Chapter 199
Whispers in the Shadows

The dim glow of Evelyn Sinclair's laptop screen cast eerie shadows across her penthouse as she scrolled through the latest gossip forum. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitating before clicking on the most recent thread—"The Blackwood Scandal: What They Don’t Want You to Know."

Her breath hitched.

The post was anonymous, but the details were too precise to ignore. It mentioned Nathan Blackwood’s late-night meetings with Victoria Hayes, his sharp-tongued secretary. Worse? It hinted at a secret deal that could dismantle Evelyn’s entire career.

"Since when does a CEO need midnight strategy sessions with his assistant?" the post taunted.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. She knew Nathan wasn’t foolish enough to risk their relationship—or his empire—for a fling. But the timing was suspicious. The Blackwood Group’s merger with Holloway Industries was days away, and Victoria had been acting strangely, her smiles a little too polished, her reports a little too flawless.

A notification popped up—Serena Whitmore, her agent.

"Evelyn, turn on Channel 7. Now."

The TV flickered to life, revealing a paparazzi shot of Nathan and Victoria leaving a boutique hotel. The headline screamed: "Power Couple in Peril?"

Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. Nathan.

She let it ring.

Outside, rain began to patter against the windows, a quiet drumroll for the storm brewing in her chest. Someone was playing games. And if they thought Evelyn Sinclair would crumble under gossip, they’d sorely underestimated her.

She grabbed her coat.

Time to pay Victoria a visit.

The slap landed with such force that Evelyn Sinclair stumbled back from her seat, her head spinning.

"Cassandra! You lied to me!" Lillian Graves' furious scream echoed through the grand hall, stunning everyone present. Just half an hour ago, these two had been inseparable allies, defending each other with fervor. Now, they stood as bitter enemies.

Born into privilege, Evelyn had never been struck before. Her porcelain cheeks flushed crimson, and she whirled around instinctively, her glare sharp enough to cut glass. The sudden surge of anger shattered her usual composure, stripping away the veneer of elegance. "How dare you hit me, Lillian? Have you completely lost your mind?"

"Lost my mind?" Lillian spat, her voice trembling with betrayal. "You're the one who's lost all sense of decency! How could you deceive me like this? I stood by you, helped you sabotage Evelyn to win back Nathan! And all this time, you were lying—your illness, your so-called relationship with Nathan—everything was a sham! You used me from the very beginning!"

Lillian was unraveling, her emotions raw and unchecked. The truth about Cassandra's manipulations had been laid bare, exposing her as nothing more than a conniving fraud. For Lillian, the revelation was unbearable. In her mind, only the flawless Cassandra deserved the equally perfect Nathan. They were supposed to be a match made in heaven.

A bitter thought twisted in Lillian's mind: If someone like Cassandra could be Nathan's girlfriend, then why not me? At least I love him unconditionally. If he chose me, I'd give up everything—my family, my future—just to be with him.

But Cassandra had fabricated her entire relationship with Nathan, leaving Lillian no room for jealousy, no hope of competing. That was why she had supported them from the start—because she believed there was no chance for her.

Now, it was all a cruel joke.

Lillian felt like she had wasted years of her life on Cassandra's lies.

Cassandra's face paled. Her reputation was already in ruins, her carefully constructed façade crumbling. Lillian's public betrayal was the final humiliation.

Now, everyone could see the truth: Cassandra had returned to steal a married man from his rightful wife.

Such scandals weren’t uncommon in high society, but they were always whispered about behind closed doors, never flaunted in public. Cassandra had been stripped of her last shred of dignity.

In that moment, for reasons she couldn’t explain, Cassandra’s gaze flickered toward Nathan.

When love turns to hate, the wounds cut deepest.

Evelyn’s voice, dripping with amusement, whispered in Nathan’s ear: This is getting more and more entertaining. Fight! Fight!

Nathan found her glee oddly endearing. But then, something else crossed his mind, and his expression darkened.

###Chapter 200 Are You Serious

Nathan had barely begun speaking when Evelyn let out a soft hum of confusion. "I understood everything," she said casually.

Nathan froze. That was odd. He distinctly remembered Evelyn insisting on tagging along during a meeting with an international client months ago—back when she couldn’t comprehend a single word. Had she secretly learned the language since then?

A flicker of suspicion crossed his mind, but he dismissed it just as quickly.

Evelyn, meanwhile, assumed the previous Nathan simply hadn’t known his wife as well as he thought. She didn’t dwell on it. Instead, she leaned back, thoroughly entertained by the chaos unfolding before her.

Across the table, Lillian had completely lost control. Her rage spiraled as she hurled vicious insults at Cassandra.

Finally, Cassandra snapped. "You’re the real snake here! Did you think I didn’t notice? The only reason you clung to me was because you’re obsessed with Nathan! You used our friendship as an excuse to see him every day." She sneered. "I’ve even caught you sniffing his jacket like some deranged stalker!"

Gasps erupted around the room. Eyes widened in shock.

Even Nathan stiffened, his face paling.

Evelyn’s head whipped toward him, her amusement fading. Wait—she’s serious? A quick mental scan confirmed it. Damn. One’s using the other as a rebound, and the other’s a full-blown creep. What a mess. She shot Nathan a pitying look. Poor guy. Needs all the prayers he can get.

Nathan, a notorious neat freak, felt his stomach churn.

Noticing his discomfort, Evelyn reached over and gave his shoulder a sympathetic pat.

The rest of the table sat in stunned silence, mentally exhausted from the never-ending drama.

A few stifled laughs broke out at the sight of Evelyn comforting Nathan.

Some things never change. The chaos just redirects.

Lillian wasn’t ashamed of her feelings for Nathan—but being exposed like this? That was a different story. Humiliation and fury collided, and before anyone could react, she lunged at Cassandra, yanking her hair.

All hell broke loose.

Screeches filled the air as Lillian rained down blows, snarling, "I’ll ruin you, you backstabbing witch!"

Cassandra, no longer the poised socialite, fought back with equal ferocity. Nails scraped, hair flew, and the elegant dinner dissolved into a full-blown brawl.

The guests gaped, then—because this was too priceless to ignore—pulled out their phones to discreetly record the spectacle.

The last time a gathering had been this chaotic was when Evelyn had attended.

Back then, though, it had just been Evelyn venting her frustrations—until Nathan stepped in and restored order.

This? This was next-level madness.

And Evelyn? She was living for it.

The scene had descended into pure chaos. Cassandra and Lila were locked in a vicious catfight, their perfectly styled hair now tangled messes as they clawed at each other's designer dresses. Insults flew sharper than their manicured nails, drawing gasps from the stunned onlookers.

It took Daniel stepping forward with Evelyn and Beatrice to finally pry the two women apart, their evening gowns torn and makeup smeared. The reunion was officially over before dessert could even be served.

Cassandra fled in humiliated tears, her dramatic exit punctuated by the slam of the hotel doors. The whispers began immediately - no way would she dare show her face in high society after this spectacle.

Life had delivered one hell of a plot twist tonight. Who could've predicted the male lead confronting his childhood sweetheart while his wife watched with popcorn-worthy amusement?

Clusters of guests lingered by the valet, buzzing with gossip as they waited for their cars. Nathan and Evelyn stood slightly apart when their tablemates approached.

Daniel broke the silence first. "I was going to announce my engagement to Amelia tonight," he said with a wry smile, "but I think the mood's thoroughly ruined. Invitations will have to do."

Nathan gave a curt nod.

Daniel's gaze flickered between Nathan and Evelyn, a knowing smirk playing on his lips as he leaned in. "So when's the big day for you two?" The penny had finally dropped about Nathan's true feelings.

Every ear in the vicinity perked up. At this point, no one cared about opinions - they just wanted to hear what the notoriously private Nathan Blackwood would say.

Though Evelyn noticed Mason, Claire, and Grayson still looked like they'd swallowed lemons.

Nathan's response never changed. He turned to Evelyn with that infuriatingly calm expression. "Her decision."

Evelyn was still mentally replaying the night's bizarre events when his words registered. "Excuse me?" The act was over, wasn't it? Why was he still playing this charade?

Nathan fought the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose. Had it genuinely not occurred to her that he might not be acting? That perhaps, just maybe, he meant every damn word?

Just as he opened his mouth to clarify, a shrill voice cut through the tension.

"Nathan! We need to talk!" Lila came charging toward them like a woman possessed.

Instinct took over. Nathan stepped back - and pulled Evelyn with him in one smooth motion.

The effect was instantaneous. Lila froze, her face draining of color at the blatant rejection. Every eye in the vicinity locked onto them.

Evelyn nearly choked trying to suppress her laughter. Seriously? He actually took a physical step back? The look on everyone's faces was absolutely priceless. This man was going to be the death of her.

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, casting delicate patterns of light across the polished marble floor. Evelyn Sinclair stood near the towering windows, her emerald-green gown flowing like liquid silk around her. The evening air carried the faint scent of roses from the gardens below, mingling with the rich aroma of champagne and expensive perfumes.

Nathan Blackwood moved through the crowd with effortless grace, his dark suit accentuating his broad shoulders. Every eye in the room followed him—some with admiration, others with envy. But his gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, a silent promise burning in his storm-gray eyes.

Victoria Hayes, standing near the champagne tower, watched the exchange with thinly veiled irritation. Her crimson lips curled into a smirk as she whispered something to the man beside her.

Evelyn felt the weight of the moment pressing against her chest. This wasn’t just another society event—it was a battlefield. The Blackwood family’s legacy, Nathan’s future, and her own heart were all at stake.

Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-loyal agent, appeared at her side, handing her a flute of champagne. "You look stunning," she murmured. "But you’re gripping that glass like you’re about to throw it at someone."

Evelyn exhaled, forcing her fingers to relax. "Wouldn’t that be a scandal?"

Serena smirked. "Oh, darling, we thrive on scandals."

Across the room, Nathan finally reached her. His fingers brushed against hers as he took the glass from her hand, his touch sending a jolt of electricity through her. "Dance with me," he said, his voice low and commanding.

Evelyn hesitated. "I thought you were avoiding me."

His lips quirked. "I was. It didn’t work."

Before she could protest, he pulled her onto the dance floor, his arm sliding around her waist. The orchestra swelled into a waltz, and suddenly, the world narrowed to just the two of them.

Victoria’s eyes burned into Evelyn’s back.

Nathan leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Ignore her. She’s not worth your attention."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Jealousy doesn’t suit you, Nathan."

He chuckled, the sound dark and rich. "Who said I was jealous?"

The music crescendoed, and Evelyn let herself be swept away—just for tonight.

But as the final notes faded, a commotion erupted near the entrance.

Margaret Blackwood, Nathan’s mother, stood frozen, her face pale as she stared at the unexpected guest who had just arrived.

A man stepped forward, his presence commanding silence.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Richard Blackwood—Nathan’s estranged father—had returned.

And the look in his eyes promised nothing but chaos.

Lily was undeniably striking. It was only her petulant attitude that gave her a somewhat harsh edge. She must have hurried to touch up her appearance earlier, because now she looked far more put-together than she had right after the altercation.

Regaining her composure, Lily seized the moment before it could slip away again. "Nathan," she declared loudly, "I love you. I truly do. I’ve loved you for ten years—ever since I first saw you during our freshman year. Cassandra misled me before. I didn’t want to ruin your happiness, so I held back. But now, I can’t stay silent any longer. I want to be with you!"

The crowd gaped at her, stunned into silence.

"Is this normal? This is insane."

"Even Cassandra tried to steal Nathan behind the scenes."

"And now, with his wife standing right there, Lily openly declares she’s going to take him? That’s beyond bold. Couldn’t she at least have been a little subtle?"

"She’s clearly lost her mind. Her mental state is terrifying."

"She was always reckless, but this is next-level."

"Seems like she’s thrown all caution to the wind tonight."

"If I were her parents, I’d be furious."

"Honestly, parents don’t raise someone like this overnight. This kind of personality takes years to cultivate."

"Speaking of which, I have to give credit to Cassandra. Somehow, she managed to keep Lily in check before."

Unsurprisingly, Lily’s shocking confession left Evelyn and Nathan momentarily speechless.

Evelyn blinked. I thought she was just a side character tonight. What’s happening? Did the minor villain just promote herself to the main antagonist? I’ve seen all kinds of love rivals, but this is a first. Strangely, her bluntness doesn’t immediately make me think of her as a shameless homewrecker. Is this what happens when someone has no shame left to hide? The audacity! I’m weirdly impressed.

Nathan had never faced a situation like this before.

Evelyn’s voice echoed in his mind. Would it count as self-defense if I stepped forward and slapped her right now? No, no. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. My hand would hurt. Even though the internet crowned me the ‘Slap Queen,’ all those scenes were staged.

Just as Evelyn was lost in her amused musings, Nathan suddenly took her hand and lifted it, placing it directly in front of Lily’s face.

"Ms. Jenner," he said coldly, "do you not see my wife standing right here?" His tone was laced with irritation, and he deliberately addressed her formally.

Tears welled in Lily’s eyes, but she held her ground—far stronger than Cassandra ever had.

She glared defiantly at Evelyn. "I’m a better match for Nathan than you are. I’m the only daughter of my family, and our entire fortune will be mine one day. The Jenner empire complements Blackwood Enterprises perfectly. If Nathan marries me, we’ll be unstoppable. If he wants it, I’ll dedicate everything—myself and my family’s wealth—to him."

Lily lifted her chin, as if looking down on Evelyn.

But the crowd only stared at her like she was a fool.

Evelyn nearly laughed. What the hell? Is this what they call a delusional romantic? Your parents must be so proud.

Before Evelyn could fire back, Lily spoke again. "Name your price. Just divorce him."

Evelyn froze. Wait—what?

Nathan’s gaze snapped to her.

"I can offer hundreds of millions—whatever you want—as long as you leave him."

Hundreds of millions? Evelyn’s eyes widened. She must mean at least two hundred million.

Nathan’s expression darkened.

Oh my god. Oh my god. I’ve only ever seen this in dramas. Someone’s actually offering me money to leave my husband! This is hilarious!

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Ms. Jenner, do you think I’m some kind of commodity to be bought and sold? My wife doesn’t need your money."

Evelyn shot him a quick glance. Of course I can’t actually negotiate this in public. Lily’s not exactly trustworthy. I can’t sell my husband so unprofessionally. Still… what a shame.

Back in her original world, she had fantasized about this exact scenario during her toughest days. She’d even rehearsed her lines.

But now that it was happening, she couldn’t say what she’d planned. Actually, I could really use that money.

She sighed wistfully—then suddenly winced as Nathan tightened his grip on her hand. Just as quickly, he loosened it.

"We’re not getting a divorce," he said abruptly, turning Evelyn to face him. His voice was low, meant only for her. "We’re not getting a divorce."

Evelyn was startled by the intensity in his expression.

Nathan’s eyes were dark, fathomless. Under the soft glow of the evening lights, they shimmered like the night sky—beautiful, mesmerizing, and dangerously easy to lose oneself in.

"The only woman I will ever call my wife is Evelyn Sinclair." Before Evelyn could react, Nathan Blackwood had already made his declaration to the entire room.

With those words, his decision was final.

His wife would always be Evelyn—no one else.

Lillian Graves stared at Nathan with wounded eyes. "Nathan, everything I've told you is the truth. As a businessman, shouldn't you understand the importance of weighing benefits against losses?"

Nathan scoffed. "Evelyn is my wife. I don’t know what values your family upholds, but in mine, we were never taught to use our wives as bargaining chips. Even if we’re talking about weighing pros and cons, you hold no value in my eyes."

His words might have offended the Graves family, but Lillian had insulted them first.

Tit for tat was only fair, and Nathan had never been one to back down.

Humiliated in front of everyone, Lillian couldn’t contain her fury. She glared at Evelyn, her voice dripping with venom. "You’re nothing but an orphan, abandoned by your own family, living off charity, and dependent on the Blackwoods for survival. How dare you compete with me for Nathan’s affection?"

The moment the words left her lips, another sharp slap landed on her already swollen cheek.

Gasps filled the room.

After enduring the night’s absurdity, Evelyn, the heroine, had finally taken action.

"You can insult me all you want, but insulting my deceased family is crossing the line," Evelyn said coolly.

Just as everyone thought it was over, she delivered another stinging slap.

"And you don’t get to disrespect my in-laws. They’ve treated me with nothing but kindness." This time, Evelyn was done.

After striking Lillian, a flicker of apprehension crossed her face. Subtly, she shifted behind Nathan, seeking refuge.

Regaining her senses, Lillian was on the verge of exploding—until she saw Nathan standing protectively in front of Evelyn. His voice was icy. "Ms. Graves, conduct yourself with dignity. And from now on, I’d prefer if you stayed out of my wife’s and my sight."

The message was clear—not just for Lillian, but for everyone present. It was a public severance of ties between Nathan and the Graves family.

The implication? No one should invite Nathan and Evelyn to any event where Lillian would be present.

The crowd was stunned. Cassandra’s past actions hadn’t warranted such a reaction, yet Lillian’s insults had led to this.

It was undeniable—Evelyn wasn’t just Nathan’s wife in name. She was his priority.

Moments later, the car arrived, and Nathan escorted Evelyn away, leaving the murmurs behind.

The sudden silence in the car snapped Evelyn out of her thoughts. The weight of the evening’s events pressed heavily on her mind, but the crisp sound of Nathan’s voice pulled her back to the present.

“I’m sorry about tonight. It all started because of me,” Nathan murmured, his tone laced with genuine remorse. His fingers tightened around the steering wheel, the leather creaking under his grip.

Evelyn glanced at the check he had handed her earlier, the numbers more than generous. A small, involuntary smile tugged at her lips. “It’s fine, really. You’ve had a rough night—your first love treating you like that, and now some secret admirer lurking in the shadows.” She chuckled, trying to lighten the mood.

Nathan’s jaw clenched. “You still don’t believe me? Cassandra isn’t my first love.”

“Oh, I believe you,” Evelyn said quickly, waving a hand. “I do. Honestly. If this is what stubbornness in love looks like, then you’re in for a wild ride. But hey, you’re a good man, Nathan. As long as you don’t end up with someone who’ll break your heart, it’s all good.”

The car fell silent again, the hum of the engine the only sound between them. Nathan kept his eyes on the road, but his mind raced. That’s it? No more questions? No reaction to anything else I did tonight?

His pulse thrummed erratically, the rhythm loud in his ears. The air between them felt charged, thick with unspoken words. He opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again, unsure of what to say.

Evelyn turned her gaze to the window, watching the city lights blur past. She could feel Nathan’s tension, the way his presence filled the space between them. But for now, she let the silence linger, the weight of the night settling over them like a heavy blanket.

###Chapter 201 I Choose You

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse windows, illuminating the steaming cup of Earl Grey in her hands. As she settled onto the plush velvet chaise, her phone buzzed with a message from her assistant, Lillian Graves.

"Miss Sinclair, the Blackwood family has just arrived at the charity gala. Nathan is wearing that navy Tom Ford suit you love."

Evelyn smirked, her fingers tapping a quick reply. "Tell me something I don’t know, Lillian."

But what she didn’t expect was the mental whisper that slithered into her mind like a serpent—Nathan Blackwood’s own thoughts.

"God, Evelyn looks breathtaking tonight. If only she knew how much I—"

Her teacup clattered against the saucer. Since when could I hear his thoughts?

Before she could process it, another voice, sharp and venomous, cut through. Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s scheming secretary, was mentally plotting. "One more slip-up from Evelyn, and I’ll make sure Nathan sees her for the gold-digger she is."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. So, not only could she hear Nathan’s private musings, but the universe had also handed her a front-row seat to her enemies’ schemes.

A wicked grin curled her lips. This was going to be fun.

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the car, a strange unease settled in her chest. Her fingers trembled slightly as she unbuckled the seatbelt, the weight of the evening's events pressing down on her. Something felt... missing. Forgotten.

Her mind raced, thoughts colliding like storm waves against a cliff. Too much had happened tonight. Too many revelations. Too many emotions.

Just as her foot touched the pavement, a warm hand encircled her wrist, stopping her mid-movement. She turned to meet Nathan's intense gaze - those dark eyes burning with unspoken words.

Apologies had been made. Debts settled. What more could he possibly want from her?

"What is it?" Evelyn asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nathan's throat worked visibly before he spoke. "Evelyn... I know you've always dreamed of a proper wedding." His grip tightened almost imperceptibly. "When you're ready... let's do it right this time."

The confession hung between them, raw and vulnerable. Nathan had never been good with emotions - especially these new, terrifying feelings that made his pulse erratic whenever Evelyn was near.

So he left the choice in her hands. He wasn't blind. The Evelyn standing before him now was a shadow of the vibrant woman from six months ago. Two years of his neglect had finally broken her spirit. The divorce papers she'd drafted were proof enough.

She didn't love him anymore. Not truly.

Perhaps she still appreciated his looks, his wealth. But the woman who'd once looked at him with stars in her eyes was gone. And it was his own damned fault.

The realization hit him like a physical blow - this bittersweet agony of finally understanding his own feelings just as hers had faded. He'd been too impatient, too arrogant to see her worth before. Now it might be too late.

His only instinct? Hold on. Tight. Because Evelyn seemed ready to vanish like morning mist. As long as she didn't say the word "divorce," there was hope. A chance to rebuild.

Irony tasted bitter on his tongue. He'd spent his entire life feeling nothing particularly strongly. Yet now? Terror froze his lungs. He couldn't breathe.

Evelyn's lips parted in shock. "A... wedding?" Her voice cracked. "You're serious?"

The pieces suddenly clicked together. They'd never had a proper ceremony before because of Cassandra. Except... Nathan had claimed there was never any real feelings there. So why...?

Her pulse hammered against her ribs. None of this made sense.

The air in the luxury car was thick with tension. Evelyn Sinclair bit her lip, lost in thought. A proper wedding? The idea was both thrilling and terrifying.

Nathan Blackwood studied her profile, his fingers tightening around the steering wheel. He couldn’t deny her logic—it would look bad for the heir of the Blackwood family to skip a grand ceremony. But that wasn’t what made his pulse race.

No silly first crush drama. No messy past. Evelyn’s inner monologue was brutally practical. My husband is wealthy, devastatingly handsome, and treats me well. His family adores me. Why would I say no?

Then came the kicker.

But will he actually sleep with me after the wedding? I refuse to live like some glorified widow!

Nathan nearly choked.

He’d expected hesitation, maybe even resistance. Not this. His cheeks burned as he glanced away, unable to meet her gaze. Swallowing hard, he forced out a whisper. "Yes. I’m willing."

Evelyn didn’t hear him. Her mind was a whirlwind.

In her past life, she’d been alone—no family, no love, no marriage. Friendships were scarce, trust scarcer. If she didn’t seize this chance, she might never have a real relationship.

If I become Mrs. Blackwood, I’ll swim in luxury. A golden spoon life beats a measly two-million monthly alimony.

Nathan exhaled in relief. Thank God for my net worth. He almost smirked, tempted to add that he also had an eight-pack. Whatever she wanted, he had it.

But doubts crept in. What if this gilded cage suffocates me? What if Nathan falls for someone else? Divorce didn’t scare her, but the aftermath did. Everyone would know I was once a Blackwood. Remarrying? Impossible.

Her chest tightened. The urge to bolt surged.

Suddenly, Nathan’s grip vanished. The car door swung open, and he was gone.

Evelyn blinked. Did I take too long?

Before she could react, he reappeared at her side, caging her against the car with his arms. His proximity stole her breath.

Nathan’s voice was rough, his breathing uneven. "Evelyn."

She stared up, wide-eyed, as he leaned in.

The world narrowed to the heat of his body, the intensity in his gaze.

And then—

He kissed her.

The golden afternoon light streamed through the car windows as Evelyn Sinclair fidgeted with the hem of her dress. The weight of Nathan Blackwood's proposal hung between them, unspoken yet undeniable.

It wouldn’t be proper for the heir of the Blackwood family to skip a real wedding, she mused.

Nathan hesitated, his fingers tightening around the steering wheel. He couldn’t argue with her logic.



Without the complications of first loves and messy breakups, this is practically a dream scenario. My husband is wealthy, devastatingly handsome, and kind. His family adores me. Why would I say no? Evelyn bit her lip. But… does this mean he’ll actually share a bed with me after the ceremony? I refuse to live like some neglected trophy wife!

Nathan nearly choked on air.

After such a long silence, her sudden, scandalous thought caught him off guard. He turned his face away, heat creeping up his neck.

Swallowing hard, he murmured, "Yes… I’m willing."

Evelyn didn’t hear him. Her mind was a whirlwind of doubts and possibilities.

If they went through with this, she’d be properly married. No take-backs.

In her past life, she’d been alone—no family, no love, no future. Making friends had been a struggle, let alone finding a partner. If she didn’t marry Nathan now, she might never have this chance again.

If I become Mrs. Blackwood, I’ll never want for anything. A life of luxury, power, security… It’s better than scraping by on alimony.

Nathan exhaled in relief. Thank God for my bank account.

He almost added that he also had a sculpted eight-pack—everything she could possibly desire. But he held his tongue.

But what if this gilded cage suffocates me? What if Nathan falls for someone else? Evelyn’s chest tightened. Another divorce wouldn’t faze me, but if we marry publicly, the whole world will know I was once his. Would anyone want me after that?

Her thoughts spiraled, her gaze distant.

Suddenly, Nathan’s grip on her wrist vanished. He flung the car door open and stepped out.

Evelyn blinked. Did I take too long?

Before she could react, he was at her side, caging her against the car with his arms. His proximity sent her pulse racing.

Nathan’s breath was uneven as he stared down at her, his voice rough. "Evelyn."

She swallowed, caught in the intensity of his gaze.

"I want you," he said, each word deliberate. "Not just as my wife. As my partner. My equal."

Her lips parted in surprise.

Nathan leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "And yes, I will share your bed."

Evelyn’s face burned.

Well then.

The decision was made.

Nathan's throat tightened, his words trapped behind an invisible barrier. It wasn't pride holding him back—it was something deeper, something raw. Every time he tried to voice his feelings, his chest constricted, his breath hitching as if his body refused to cooperate.

I might die if I say this out loud.

The realization struck him hard. He had never spoken these words to any woman before. Never allowed himself to be this vulnerable. But Evelyn's soft voice, laced with hesitation, forced him to push through.

"Evelyn," he began, his voice rougher than intended. "If you agree to this marriage, there are things I need to say first."

Her brows arched. Oh? I haven't even said yes, and he's already laying down conditions?

Nathan's gaze darkened, intense and unwavering. He leaned closer, his eyes locking onto hers with a possessiveness that made her pulse stutter. "Be my wife, and that's all. You don’t have to change. You don’t have to play a role. You can do whatever you want—or nothing at all. You’ll have your freedom. The only thing I ask is that you stay by my side, happy and unburdened. You are Evelyn first. My wife second."

Evelyn's breath caught.

What is happening? The way he’s speaking—it sounds like… a proposal?

Nathan’s lips curved, his eyes gleaming with something dangerously close to affection. "We started wrong, Evelyn. I want to begin again. I don’t have flowers. I don’t have a ring. But this is a proposal. You know that, don’t you?"

Wait—what? Her thoughts spun. A proposal? Since when is he in love with me?

Nathan ignored her silent panic. He refused to let her overthinking ruin this moment. With deliberate slowness, he closed the distance between them. Evelyn’s eyes widened as he leaned in, his lips brushing against her forehead in a kiss so tender it stole her breath.

His throat worked as he pulled back slightly, his fingers lingering on her cool skin. She smelled like vanilla and something uniquely her—intoxicating. It took every ounce of willpower not to kiss her properly.

But beneath his touch, Evelyn remained stiff, her body tense with disbelief.

Nathan studied her face, the storm of emotions in her eyes. A faint smirk tugged at his lips.

"Because I’ve fallen for you," he murmured, his voice rough with sincerity. "And I want to be with you."

###Chapter 202 Taking It Slow

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the grand ballroom, all eyes turned toward her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the room, but none of it compared to the way she carried herself—graceful, poised, and effortlessly captivating.

Nathan Blackwood watched her from across the room, his fingers tightening around his glass of whiskey. She was a vision in emerald green, the dress hugging her curves in all the right places. He had seen her in countless meetings, but tonight was different. Tonight, she wasn’t just his business rival—she was the woman who had unknowingly taken over his thoughts.

Victoria Hayes, his ever-watchful secretary, leaned in with a smirk. "She’s certainly making an entrance, isn’t she?"

Nathan didn’t respond. His gaze remained locked on Evelyn as she laughed at something Preston Whitmore, the renowned director, had said. The sound of her laughter was like music, and it irked him that he wasn’t the one causing it.

Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s sharp-witted agent, appeared beside her, whispering something that made Evelyn’s eyes flicker toward Nathan. Their gazes clashed, and for a heartbeat, the room faded away.

Then Donovan Sharpe, the event’s producer, clinked his glass for attention. "Ladies and gentlemen, before we proceed with tonight’s auction, we have a special announcement."

Evelyn’s fingers curled around her clutch. She had been waiting for this moment—the reveal of the Blackwood Foundation’s newest project. But when Donovan continued, his words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd.

"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Blackwood Foundation will be merging its resources with Sinclair Enterprises for this initiative."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. This wasn’t part of the plan.

Evelyn’s lips parted in surprise before she schooled her expression into one of polite interest. But Nathan saw the fire in her eyes. She hadn’t known either.

Victoria’s smirk widened. "Looks like you’ll be working closely with her after all."

Nathan set his glass down with deliberate calm. "This changes nothing."

But as he watched Evelyn stride toward the stage, her chin lifted in defiance, he knew one thing for certain—this was far from over.

And he wasn’t sure if he was dreading it… or anticipating it.

Falling for you, fallen for you, fallen...

Evelyn's mind went completely blank. It was uncanny how Nathan's words always seemed to echo the unspoken questions in her heart.

After his little speech, a flush of embarrassment crept up Nathan's neck. His ears turned pink, the color spreading across his chiseled features like wildfire. He swallowed hard, his gaze flickering nervously to Evelyn's face.

The truth was, he was terrified. Terrified that if he laid his heart bare, this new version of Evelyn—the one who had finally started trusting him—might retreat back into her shell.

But if they were ever going to start fresh, he had to be honest.

Nathan held his breath, watching for any flicker of reaction. He half-expected some tender confession in return, but instead, Evelyn blinked rapidly and pushed him away with both hands.

His throat tightened.

When he saw the panic flashing in her eyes, he forced a shaky laugh. "That bad, huh?"

Nathan felt the sting of rejection like a physical blow. "If you need time to think, that's fine," he said quickly, his voice rougher than he intended. "But don't just... shut me out like that. I've never felt this way about anyone before."

Evelyn stared up at him. The usual confidence in his storm-gray eyes had been replaced by something vulnerable—something raw. Her pulse skittered wildly. She'd navigated boardroom takeovers and media scandals with ease, but this? This was uncharted territory.

If this were just another business arrangement, it would be simple. Money, power, even lust—those were currencies she understood. But love? Real, messy, inconvenient love? That made her feel like a fraud, like she was stealing something precious under false pretenses.

At her core, Evelyn respected genuine emotion too much to play games with it.

Nathan's sudden confession had left her scrambling for footing.

Since when had the script flipped? Wasn't he supposed to be the untouchable CEO, the man who never let anyone close? The one who kept his heart locked away behind steel walls?

Honestly, her reaction shouldn't have surprised him.

Seeing her struggle, Nathan did the one thing she least expected—he gave her space.

"Evelyn," he said softly, stepping back, "you don't have to answer me now. Think of this as me... courting you properly. We'll take it slow. Get to know each other without the contracts and cameras. When—if—you're ever ready, you'll tell me. And then..." His lips quirked in that devastating half-smile. "Then we'll have our real wedding."

The retreat was a masterstroke. Evelyn felt the tension leave her shoulders in a rush.

He wasn't bulldozing into her life like a hurricane. Instead, he was knocking gently at the door of her heart, waiting for permission to enter.

And God knew Evelyn hated being backed into corners.

"Okay," she breathed at last. "Okay, we can... try that."

Nathan's smile could have powered cities. "Good. Because Sinclair? I plan to woo you so thoroughly, you'll forget you ever doubted this."

The promise in his voice sent shivers down her spine.

This was either going to be the best decision of her life—or the most catastrophic.

With those words, Evelyn quickly slipped away, clearly unwilling to face the situation.

"I'm exhausted. I'm going to take a nap."



Though Nathan was disappointed, he didn’t try to stop her. He simply let Evelyn retreat into the house.

When he stepped through the front door, all traces of her had vanished. Not even the faintest whisper of her presence could be heard. It seemed she had barricaded herself in the bedroom.

Yet, she had barely eaten anything at dinner. Normally by this hour, she would’ve already raided the kitchen for a midnight snack, but tonight, she was conspicuously absent. Nathan chuckled to himself and went in search of the housekeeper.

Suddenly, he realized the house was eerily quiet. Where was everyone?

Since the family gathering had ended early, the Blackwoods should’ve been lounging downstairs.

Something felt off.

As Nathan passed by a room, he heard muffled voices. It sounded like a heated discussion.

Curious, he turned and found himself staring at the security control room.

He pushed the door open.

"Evelyn isn’t head over heels for Nathan. Would she really leave him?" Genevieve asked, her voice trembling with distress.

"What do we do? I adore Evelyn! I don’t want her to leave the Blackwood family," Sophia fretted.

"Calm down! She hasn’t rejected him yet. I have faith in Nathan!" Julian declared.

"Could this be the grand pursuit of love?" Margaret mused.

"No, no, no. It’s more like realizing love too late," Richard countered.

"Aren’t they already married?" Theodore pointed out.

"I believe Ms. Evelyn still has feelings for Mr. Nathan. They just need time to sort things out," the butler offered wisely.

"Exactly! They never had a proper courtship. Maybe Ms. Evelyn wants Mr. Nathan to woo her properly," the housekeeper added.

It was a sight to behold—the entire Blackwood family huddled in the security room, watching the drama unfold live. They were utterly engrossed in the gossip.

When they’d noticed Nathan’s car parked outside for so long, curiosity had gotten the better of them. Not wanting to interrupt a private moment, they’d resorted to spying through the security feed—only to stumble upon the juiciest gossip in ages.

The Blackwoods had all noticed the gradual improvement in Nathan and Evelyn’s relationship. He’d been treating her better lately.

But hearing the words "falling in love" come out of his mouth? That had shocked them all.



They’d assumed the couple would grow closer after Nathan cleared up misunderstandings at the gathering. But no one had expected such a confession from the usually stoic Nathan.

People praised his decisiveness in business, but who knew he’d be just as bold in love?

The family was deep in debate when they suddenly sensed someone watching. All heads swiveled to find Nathan standing at the door, his expression unreadable. He’d reached peak embarrassment, frozen in place.

Being caught gossiping didn’t faze the Blackwoods, though.

Julian was the first to speak. "Don’t worry, brother. Keep your chin up. I suggest you take her on a date tomorrow. A few romantic outings, and she’ll remember how she once felt about you!"

Genevieve immediately disagreed. "No, no. She’s been avoiding us all evening. Give her space. Push too hard, and you’ll scare her off."

Julian shot her a look. "That’s your perspective, but Evelyn isn’t like you."

Genevieve scoffed. "And you’re no expert either. Given your track record with women, maybe you shouldn’t be giving advice."

Julian nearly exploded. "Oh, like you’re any better! Your dating history isn’t exactly impressive."

Seeing the siblings about to brawl, Sophia interjected, "I think—"

Twin glares silenced her. Their eyes screamed, Stay out of this.

Sophia clamped her mouth shut. Fine. Not like I have any wisdom to share anyway.

"How did our romantic genes skip these four?" Richard muttered.

"Must’ve been a genetic mutation," Margaret replied dryly.

"Good point," Richard agreed.

Nathan massaged his temples. "Please, just stay out of it. Pretend you know nothing. Otherwise, she’ll be mortified."

Evelyn loved gossip—but being the subject of it? That was another story.

The family quickly promised to keep quiet before scattering from the room.

Nathan’s siblings were stunned by his earlier confession. When had he developed these feelings? And how deep did they run?

Nathan had no answers for them. He didn’t even know himself.

Strangely, his parents didn’t seem surprised at all. Almost as if they’d seen it coming.

Nathan Blackwood had always been guarded with his emotions—a trait deeply rooted in his troubled past. As a child, he'd endured phases of extreme introversion, often withdrawing from the world for weeks at a time.

Yet beneath that icy exterior, his emotions burned fiercely.

During one of his silent spells as a boy, his family had taken him on vacation, hoping to lift his spirits. That was when they'd stayed with Evelyn Sinclair’s family.

For three days, Evelyn had shadowed Nathan relentlessly, her sunny disposition unwavering despite his silence. He hadn’t spoken a single word to her the entire time.

But when the Sinclairs left, Nathan shattered. Tears streamed down his face, so sudden and violent that his parents panicked, calling a doctor, convinced he was ill. It never occurred to them that he might have been crying for Evelyn.

Afterward, once the doctor left, Nathan sealed himself off even further, as if that outburst had drained him of all feeling.

But emotions, when suppressed too long, always find a way to erupt. Perhaps that was what had happened with Evelyn all those years ago.

Now, the situation had reversed. Evelyn’s obsession with Nathan had always been puzzling. Before her adoption, they’d barely interacted. Nearly a decade had passed without them seeing each other.

As a child, Evelyn had been radiant—warm, cheerful, effortlessly kind to everyone. So when she’d first met Nathan, her affection toward him hadn’t stood out. To the adults, it was just two children playing.

Years later, when she moved into the Blackwood estate, she became a ghost—distant, untouchable. The family assumed grief had hollowed her out after losing her parents, so they tolerated her coldness, though it made them uneasy.

Julian had never warmed to her, barely acknowledging her presence. Genevieve, younger and more timid, quickly learned not to bother her. Sophia, meanwhile, had married young and left home.

Nathan, busy with university, rarely visited. Yet somehow, Evelyn had fallen for him at first sight. Every time he returned, she was the one who sought him out, her advances growing bolder with each encounter. Nathan remained polite but detached—until their arranged marriage.

In the two years that followed, Evelyn’s fixation spiraled into something unsettling, her actions toeing the line between devotion and desperation.

It was impossible to tell whether she truly loved Nathan or simply craved the security of being his wife.

Now, the tables had turned. Nathan was the one falling for her—exactly what the family had always hoped for.

But love, especially for someone like Nathan, was never simple.
###Chapter 203 Playing It Dark

Richard set down his whiskey glass with a knowing smirk. "Winning someone's heart isn't as complicated as you think, Nathan. It's about persistence—and timing."

Margaret nodded, her eyes warm with encouragement. "You and Evelyn share something rare. Fate won't let that go to waste."

Yet for seven long days, Evelyn avoided Nathan like a storm she refused to weather.

Then, the invitation arrived.

The Hampton family's gala.

Evelyn's fingers froze around the embossed cardstock. A memory flickered—un business.

Has Violet ended things with Mason yet? Did Anders really sabotage her makeup career? She scoffed. No, Claire's married to Ethan now. She should focus on being the perfect wife instead of stirring drama.

But that wasn't the point.

The real question is—are Violet and Mason still together?

A slow, wicked smile curved her lips. I have to go. This train wreck deserves an audience.

She turned to find Nathan watching her, the invitation dangling from his fingers like a challenge.

The tension in the penthouse was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair paced the length of the marble floor, her heels clicking sharply with each step. Outside, the city lights twinkled like distant stars, but she barely noticed. Her mind was consumed by the events of the past twenty-four hours—Nathan Blackwood’s sudden disappearance, the cryptic message left on her phone, and the unsettling feeling that someone was watching her every move.

Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant, hovered nearby, clutching a tablet filled with updates. "Evelyn, we still haven’t heard from Nathan. His last known location was the Blackwood estate, but security says he left hours ago."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, raking a hand through her hair. "And no one thought to track his car?"

Lillian hesitated. "His GPS was disabled."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. Nathan never went off-grid unless it was deliberate. Something was wrong.

Her phone buzzed—an unknown number. The message was brief, but it sent her pulse racing:

"If you want to see him again, come alone. Warehouse 17. Midnight."

Lillian’s eyes widened as she read over Evelyn’s shoulder. "You can’t seriously be considering this. It’s obviously a trap."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "I don’t have a choice."

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan Blackwood stirred in a dimly lit room, his wrists bound to a chair. The last thing he remembered was leaving his office, then—nothing. A sharp pain throbbed at the base of his skull.

A shadow moved in the corner.

"Awake at last," a familiar voice drawled.

Nathan’s blood ran cold. Vincent Holloway.

The notorious playboy stepped into the light, a smirk playing on his lips. "You really should’ve stayed out of my business, Blackwood."

Nathan’s mind raced. This wasn’t just about him—Evelyn was in danger.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn slipped a small blade into her boot, her movements swift and precise. She had no intention of walking into this blind.

Lillian gripped her arm. "At least let me call Marcus Donovan. He can—"

"No," Evelyn cut in. "If they see backup, they’ll kill him."

As the clock struck eleven, Evelyn stepped into the elevator, her reflection a mask of steely determination.

The game had changed.

And she was done playing by their rules.

Nathan's father Richard sank the final ball with a smooth stroke. "Winning a woman's heart isn't complicated," he said, leaning against the pool table. "It's about persistence and..."

"You two share something special," Margaret added, swirling her cocktail. "Mark my words, you'll end up together."

Yet for seven long days, Evelyn deliberately avoided Nathan. Every call went unanswered, every text ignored.

Then the Hampton invitation arrived.

The embossed cardstock triggered Evelyn's memory.

Violet and Mason - are they still together? Did Mason really hire her as his personal makeup artist? But Claire's already married to Ethan now... Why should I care? Unless...

A wicked smile curved her lips. They haven't broken up yet! This gala just became irresistible.

She turned to find Nathan studying the invitation, his stormy gaze lifting to meet hers. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Let the games begin.

The entire week, the Blackwoods had been more restless than anyone else.

The family had eagerly anticipated Nathan’s pursuit of Evelyn, actively rooting for them to get together. But they had all underestimated Evelyn’s ability to read his intentions. There was absolutely no visible progress—after all, Nathan wasn’t the type to effortlessly charm women.

Evelyn, too, was at a loss, drowning in awkwardness. This is all his fault. I can barely look him in the eye anymore.

Unlike those soap opera CEOs who spent their days chasing women while their businesses miraculously ran themselves, Nathan was a real CEO with a grueling schedule. This left little time for in-person meetings, so most of their interactions happened through texts.

He always knew the perfect moments—sending her morning greetings just as she was likely still lounging in bed, initiating light conversation, and bidding her goodnight before turning in. Every break between meetings was another excuse to text her—his subtle way of saying I miss you without actually saying it.

Nothing overt had been done to make Evelyn nervous, yet she couldn’t shake the feeling that something between them had shifted. After all, the old Nathan would never have acted this way.

At first, Evelyn managed these digital exchanges just fine—as long as she didn’t have to face him in person. But one evening, she finally cracked. After dinner, she lingered behind, curiosity burning too fiercely to ignore. I need to know what’s going on. The gossip withdrawal was worse than the embarrassment. This is all Nathan’s fault—he’s been messing with my head so much I forgot to keep up with the drama.

That night, Audrey had set everything up—so Violet should have learned Mason’s true identity by now, right? Yet they were still together. Did the party ending early mean Violet missed the big reveal?

Meanwhile, Nathan smirked, fingers tracing the edge of an invitation. The way he’d managed to rattle Evelyn amused him to no end.

The others at the table weren’t as perceptive as Nathan, too absorbed in the fresh gossip Evelyn had just spilled. In fact, they were mildly annoyed he hadn’t shared Violet’s drama earlier—only Julian had dropped a few hints, fueling the family’s speculation.

They’d already dissected every possible angle, concluding that the two were still entangled, even after his ex-girlfriend became his sister-in-law.

Listening to Evelyn’s inner monologue now only confirmed it—but who exactly was Violet?

The name, paired with Evelyn’s mention of a makeup artist, sparked recognition in Genevieve. Having worked closely with Julian and Evelyn, she quickly pieced it together.

Though they were all seated at the dining table sipping coffee, everyone except Evelyn and Nathan instinctively reached for their phones.

Genevieve eagerly shared every juicy detail she’d uncovered.

From Evelyn’s thoughts, an absurd theory took shape.

Wait—so Violet knows? Did she find out her boyfriend, the one she’s been supporting for years under the guise of him building a startup, is actually the second son of the Hampton family? That he’s been lying about being broke this whole time? That day, she’d seen Mason flaunting his wealth—yet she hadn’t confronted him. Instead, she’d played along.

The Blackwoods collectively gasped.

Richard: Outrageous.
Margaret: What’s wrong with Mason?
Sophia: That’s despicable!
Julian: Is he toying with her? Does he still have feelings for his sister-in-law?

Genevieve was the most furious, having grown close to Violet. She’d often seen Violet endure harsh criticism from her mentor with nothing but a strained smile. Once, Genevieve had asked if Violet was okay with her boyfriend’s behavior, but Violet had brushed it off like it was nothing.

Despite the struggles, Violet had seemed genuinely happy. She truly believed the man she loved was destined for greatness—brilliant, capable, just waiting for his big break.

Now, Genevieve understood. Brilliant? Of course a Hampton heir would appear that way to an ordinary girl. But Violet valued honesty above all. What happens when she learns the truth?

Realization flickered across Evelyn’s face. Mason told Violet he had something important to say on her birthday—he meant to come clean. But that gave her hope. She waited, unsure how to react, because she’s been in love with him for two years. She’s emotionally dependent on him. Maybe she was just in denial.

The Blackwoods: She hasn’t celebrated her birthday yet? Now that Violet was working another makeup job, if they’d already had that conversation, Mason would never have let her take it.

Evelyn: What the hell. Even God must’ve been fed up. That’s why He threw a wrench in their plans—keeping them apart.

Everyone perked up. What does that mean? What did God do?

Evelyn: The birthday party ended without Mason saying a word. He didn’t even see Violet that day. Know why? Because the night before, Violet suddenly asked him for a loan of half a million. Mason was so furious he gave her the cold shoulder.

The Blackwoods: What? Why would she need half a million out of nowhere? And why would he react like that?

Nathan Blackwood hadn't been paying much attention to the gossip circulating among his social circle. His mind was preoccupied with more pressing matters—how to convince Evelyn Sinclair to accompany him to the upcoming gala, and whether he could steal her away for a private moment during the event.

But when he overheard the latest rumor about Violet Carter, his interest was piqued. His friend leaned in with a conspiratorial whisper, and Nathan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. What kind of twisted logic was this?

Evelyn: Now I understand why Violet always let Mason Hunter walk all over her.

As the middle child in her family—sandwiched between an accomplished older sister and a doted-upon younger brother—Violet had grown up starved for attention. Her parents weren’t cruel, nor were they intentionally unfair, but in families like hers, love was a finite resource, and the squeaky wheel got the grease.

The quiet ones? They learned to make themselves smaller.

Violet had spent her childhood fading into the background, her needs overlooked, her presence taken for granted. That kind of neglect left scars—deep, invisible ones that shaped the way she saw herself. So when Mason came along, clinging to her like she was his lifeline, she latched onto him with desperate gratitude.

Finally, someone who needed her.

The Blackwood family exchanged uneasy glances as they listened. It was heartbreaking, really—the way Violet had mistaken manipulation for devotion.

Mason’s so-called dependence was nothing more than a carefully constructed trap. By convincing Violet she was his entire world, he’d systematically cut her off from everyone else. No friends. No support. Just him.

And now, she was asking to borrow half a million dollars.

A sudden realization struck the Blackwoods like a lightning bolt. Wait a minute—hadn’t she just said something earlier that didn’t add up?

Just as confusion settled over them, a crucial piece of information came to light—one that changed everything.


###Chapter 204 The Entire Family Absorbed In Gossip

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the same line for the tenth time.

Why can't I focus?

Her phone buzzed—another message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Lillian: The meeting with Preston Whitmore is in two hours. Don’t forget, he’s expecting your final decision on the script.

Evelyn groaned. She had been avoiding this conversation. The role was perfect—a strong, complex lead in a major studio production. But something held her back.

Her thoughts drifted to Nathan Blackwood.

Ever since their explosive argument at the gala last week, they hadn’t spoken. His words still echoed in her mind: "You’re running away again, Evelyn. When will you stop hiding behind your career?"

A sharp knock at her door startled her.

"Evelyn? It's me."

That voice.

Her breath hitched. Nathan.

She hesitated before opening the door. He stood there, his dark eyes stormy, jaw clenched. The scent of his cologne—something woodsy and intoxicating—flooded her senses.

"We need to talk," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "About what? You made your opinion of me very clear."

Nathan stepped closer, his gaze burning into hers. "I was wrong."

Her heart stuttered. What?

Before she could respond, he continued, "I shouldn’t have said those things. But I meant what I said about you running. You’re considering turning down Preston’s film because you’re scared—not because it’s not right for you."

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. "You don’t know what you’re talking about."

Nathan smirked, that infuriating, charming smirk that always unraveled her. "Then prove me wrong. Take the role. Show me—and yourself—that you’re not afraid."

Her pulse raced.

A beat of silence stretched between them, charged with unspoken tension.

Then, her phone rang again. Preston Whitmore’s name flashed on the screen.

Nathan raised an eyebrow. "Well? Are you going to answer it?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers hovering over the screen.

This was it. A choice.

She swiped to accept the call.

Preston: Evelyn, darling. Have you made your decision?

She met Nathan’s gaze, a challenge in her eyes.

"Yes," she said, her voice steady. "I’m in."

Nathan’s lips curved into a slow, approving smile.

But as Preston’s delighted response filled her ear, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that this decision would change everything.

And not just for her career.

For them.

Evelyn Sinclair: Violet Carter's family suddenly faced a financial crisis and urgently needed funds. She tried borrowing from others but hit dead ends everywhere. With no other options left, she hesitantly approached Mason Hunter for help, secretly hoping this might mend their strained relationship—if he came through and finally told her the truth. But Mason's reaction shocked her. He accused her of lying and demanded she confess, leaving Violet utterly devastated. Even as she swore she was being honest, Mason stormed off in a rage.

The Blackwoods were speechless. He didn’t believe her? What was there not to believe? The sheer audacity of him—accusing her of deception when he was the one who had lied! Was this his guilt talking, deflecting blame onto her despite knowing he was the one at fault?

Evelyn: Mason’s an absolute fool. But that’s not even the worst part—Claire Morgan is still in the picture!

The Blackwood Family: What? What did she do?

Evelyn: After setting her initial trap, Claire expected Violet to confront Mason immediately. To her surprise, not only did Violet stay silent during the reunion, but she vanished afterward without a trace. Even more shocking? Mason announced he’d bring his girlfriend to the next family gathering. The unexpected turn left Claire unsettled. She wasn’t sure if Violet knew the truth, but she couldn’t risk it. After some digging, she discovered Violet had been desperately borrowing money. So, she went to Mason…

The Blackwoods leaned in, nerves taut. What did she say? Spill it!

Evelyn: Claire told Mason his efforts were pointless—his true identity wasn’t some well-kept secret. She insinuated Violet might already know his background and was pretending not to care about his financial struggles, all to manipulate his feelings. Worse? She hinted Violet’s "helpless" act was just a ploy to eventually extort money from him. Damn, she’s vicious!

The Blackwoods: Ugh, she knew exactly how to poison his mind!

Evelyn: At first, Mason dismissed her claims, but Claire kept needling him to "verify Violet’s true intentions." She even warned him that Violet’s sudden financial plea might be part of her scheme. Honestly, Claire’s a master at weaving traps.

The family exchanged stunned glances. Who’d have guessed that beneath Claire’s polished socialite exterior lurked such cunning?

Nathan Blackwood, who’d once been Claire’s classmate, felt a chill. His opinion of her had shattered. How could Mason fall for her manipulations so easily? Especially when he claimed to genuinely care for Violet.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Blackwoods buzzed with anticipation. What happened next?

Then came the twist.

Evelyn: Initially, Violet had borrowed money from others. When Mason found out, he remembered Claire’s warnings. Though skeptical, he questioned Violet’s motives and discreetly investigated. But—plot twist—his people found zero evidence of the Carter family seeking loans.

The Blackwoods gasped. A setup? Had Violet’s family deceived her?

Evelyn: The Mandor family was tangled in something illegal—something they dared not reveal. That’s why Violet couldn’t confide in anyone…

Why did they depend on Violet Carter, who lived miles away, to bail them out of their financial crisis? If this got reported, their situation would be catastrophic. Yet Mason Hunter remained clueless, relying solely on rumors. If Nathan Blackwood were in his place, he would’ve dug deeper—Mason deserved to stay single forever!

The Blackwoods: We see.

Nathan: Did she just sneak in a compliment about me?

Evelyn Sinclair: After his half-hearted investigation revealed the Meadows family hadn’t borrowed money, Mason immediately concluded Violet was lying. He even assumed she knew his true identity and was scheming to extort money from him. Heartbroken, he nearly ended things with her on the spot.

After catching up on a week’s worth of drama, Evelyn finally snapped. Damn it, Mason. How dare you give Violet the silent treatment? You have the audacity to even think about breaking up with her?

Though it seemed like a chain of misunderstandings, Mason’s actions were downright infuriating!

The Blackwoods gasped in unison, horrified by the emotional toll Violet had endured.

Even if Violet confessed the truth now, Evelyn was certain Mason would still suspect her of being a gold-digger. But wasn’t this his own fault? He was the one who started their relationship with lies! Go ahead, keep making a fool of yourself. Soon, you’ll realize you’re the biggest idiot of all. Because of his rejection, Violet had no choice but to accept Claire Morgan’s offer—becoming the personal makeup artist for his mother and sister-in-law.

Even the Blackwoods couldn’t stay silent. Claire is truly ruthless, isn’t she? Was the breakup not enough? Now she’s humiliating Violet like this? While no job was beneath anyone, Claire hiring Violet to serve her family was pure malice.

Evelyn: I can’t wait to see Mason’s face when he runs into Violet.

After finishing her gossip session, Evelyn glanced at the invitation in Nathan’s hand. "So… are you going?"

She’d seen him decline similar wine-tasting invitations before. If he refused, she’d have to attend alone—something she wasn’t looking forward to. "It’s at your friend’s estate. You’ll be there, right?"

Nathan’s heart skipped a beat at the hopeful glimmer in Evelyn’s eyes.

He turned to her, lips curling into a soft smile. Though he usually avoided such events, he’d gladly accompany her—he knew how much she adored them.

He hummed thoughtfully. "So, just the two of us—"

Before he could finish, Margaret Blackwood cut in, "Isn’t this a family invitation?"

Richard Blackwood nodded. "It’s been ages since we last attended a wine-tasting. I’m sure Liam Bennett would love to have us."

Sophia Blackwood piped up, "I’m free too!"

Julian Blackwood cleared his throat. "I’ve been meaning to shop for gifts to take overseas anyway."

"The wine selection from the Hampton estate seems exquisite."

"I—I've been considering that now might be the perfect time to educate myself on wine appreciation," Genevieve added, seizing the opportunity to justify her attendance at the event.

"In that case, let's all go together!"

Evelyn: Perfect! Now I won’t have to face Nathan alone anymore. Hallelujah!

Nathan was utterly speechless.

His sharp glare swept over them, prompting the entire family to lower their heads in unison, avoiding his piercing gaze. We’d love to give you space, but your relationship is moving at a snail’s pace. There’s no way we’re missing out on potential drama just to respect your privacy. Sorry, not sorry!

At that moment, not a single Blackwood was willing to sacrifice the chance to witness whatever spectacle might unfold later.

Nathan’s sorrowful, accusing stare only deepened the collective guilt weighing on the family.

The Blackwoods: Oh, come on! Worst-case scenario, we’ll entertain ourselves and leave you two alone. Stop being so dramatic!

Despite his vehement reluctance, Nathan ultimately found himself attending the Hampton family’s wine-tasting soirée—dragged along by his meddling relatives.

They arrived before any other guests, eager to catch even the slightest hint of tension.

After all, the makeup artist would surely arrive early.

They couldn’t risk missing a single unexpected development.

What would be the point of coming if they didn’t witness something juicy?

Given the Blackwoods’ status and influence, a single representative would have sufficed for such an event. The only connection between the two families was Mason’s strained relationship with Nathan.

So when the entire Blackwood clan announced their attendance, the Hamptons were visibly stunned. They scrambled to greet them with excessive enthusiasm, their warm reception almost suggesting a potential business alliance between the two families.

The Hamptons failed to notice that, despite the polite exchanges, the Blackwoods’ attention was subtly—but unmistakably—fixed on Mason and Claire. Of course, the down-to-earth older brother, Ethan, also garnered some curious glances.

###Chapter 205 Is He Waiting For Violet
Whispers of the Heart

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's bedroom as she stretched lazily beneath her silk sheets. Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand, pulling her from the remnants of sleep. With a sigh, she grabbed it, blinking at the flood of notifications lighting up the screen.

Gossip alerts. Again.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn’t resist tapping into the latest scandal. The headline blared:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Elite Club with Mystery Woman—Is Evelyn Sinclair Out of the Picture?"

Her breath hitched. A familiar ache flared in her chest, sharp and unwelcome.

Not this again.

She swiped through the grainy photos—Nathan’s tall frame unmistakable even in the dim lighting, his arm draped casually around a slender blonde. The caption speculated wildly: Could this be the end of the power couple?

Evelyn scoffed, tossing her phone onto the bed.

"Pathetic," she muttered, though her fingers twitched with the urge to pick it back up.

A knock at her door startled her.

"Evelyn?" Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, peeked in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "You have a fitting in an hour. Preston Whitmore wants to discuss the final edits on your script afterward."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thanks, Lillian. I’ll be ready."

As the door clicked shut, she exhaled sharply, pressing her palms to her temples.

Why does this still bother me?

She and Nathan had been over for months. Officially, at least. Yet every tabloid mention of him sent her spiraling.

Her phone buzzed again. A text from her agent, Serena Whitmore:

"Don’t react. We’ll handle it."

Evelyn groaned. Serena’s version of "handling it" usually meant a carefully crafted PR statement—cold, polished, and utterly devoid of the messy truth.

She snatched her phone, thumb hovering over Nathan’s contact.

No. Absolutely not.

But the memory of his low laugh, the way his fingers had traced idle patterns on her skin—

"Ugh!" She flopped back onto the pillows, glaring at the ceiling.

A sudden realization struck her.

The blonde in the photo? She recognized her.

Victoria Hayes. Nathan’s scheming ex-secretary.

Evelyn sat bolt upright, heart pounding.

This isn’t just gossip. This is a setup.

And if Victoria was making a move…

Evelyn’s lips curled into a slow, dangerous smile.

Game on.

The elders from both families took turns introducing their younger relatives. Ethan Carter, the eldest son of the Hampton family and tonight's host, naturally took charge of entertaining the guests.

His words carried refined sophistication, his every movement exuding effortless grace. Though not as strikingly handsome as Mason Hunter, his presence was undeniably magnetic. Among the younger generation, his talents might not rival Nathan Blackwood’s, but he was still exceptional in his own right.

No wonder the Hamptons had chosen him as their heir without hesitation.

Claire, that lunatic, already has such an incredible man, yet she’s still unsatisfied. Talk about insatiable greed.

Some members of the Blackwood family were meeting Ethan for the first time, but their first impression of him was flawless. Hearing Evelyn’s silent judgment, they couldn’t help but nod in agreement.

Ethan was clearly extraordinary in every way, yet Claire remained ungrateful.

Remembering the chaos Claire had caused for Mason, their gazes softened with sympathy as they looked at Ethan.

As Ethan exchanged pleasantries, an inexplicable chill ran down his spine, making him shudder.

"The ballroom for the wine tasting is ready. Please forgive any oversights—there are still a few finishing touches left. How about Mason escorts everyone inside first?"

Given Nathan and Mason’s close friendship, it was only natural for Ethan to want Mason to take care of his guest.

But when he turned, he found Mason lost in thought. Rumors swirled about his fight with his girlfriend. Though Ethan didn’t know the details, he couldn’t let Mason’s mood ruin tonight’s event.

Ethan clapped Mason on the back with a chuckle. "Mason, don’t just stand there. Go take care of your friend."

Dark circles shadowed Mason’s eyes, his energy drained. He looked like a man tormented by love.

Snapping back to reality, Mason forced himself to straighten up and led the Blackwood family toward the ballroom.

Liam Bennett and Grace Collins stayed behind with Richard and Margaret, while Ethan continued overseeing preparations.

"Darling, I still need to finish my makeup. I’ll be in the dressing room," Claire murmured, lingering close to Ethan.

Ethan gave a brief nod.

Noticing Claire wasn't walking with them and appeared only half-ready, Evelyn instantly caught on.

Oh my stars, I nearly missed the juicy drama unfolding!

The Blackwood family members, strolling into the ballroom together, immediately perked up their ears, eager to catch Evelyn's thoughts.

Violet had already arrived, but Mason had been brooding in a corner all evening, completely unaware of her presence. Perfect timing! With Violet here already, we're stuck in the opening act, it seems.

The Blackwoods exchanged startled glances.

As they stepped into the ballroom, it felt like entering an enchanted realm. Crystal chandeliers cast shimmering light over artfully arranged wine displays—each bottle, glass, and decanter placed with meticulous care. At every tasting station, a dedicated server stood ready to pour.

In one corner, musical instruments waited silently for the band to arrive and set the mood.

The Blackwoods couldn't hide their surprise, though the Bennetts misinterpreted it as awe at the venue's grandeur.

Liam and Grace swelled with pride.

Grace smiled warmly. "Ethan and Claire planned every detail themselves."

Though the decor hadn't stunned the Blackwoods, they offered polite compliments after Grace's remark. The setup was impressive, after all.

"This is our first wine-tasting event," Liam said cheerfully. "There might be hiccups, but we hope our guests enjoy themselves."

"The arrangement is exquisite," Richard remarked honestly.

"As long as it leaves an impression, that's what matters!" Liam laughed heartily.

Oh, poor Mr. Bennett. This is supposed to be the Hampton family's passion project, but their daughter-in-law is using it to humiliate their youngest son's girlfriend. Tsk, tsk, tsk. If this backfires, it'll definitely leave a lasting impression—just not the kind they want.

Hearing Evelyn's sarcastic musing, the Blackwoods turned sympathetic eyes toward Liam and Grace, who still beamed with oblivious pride. A man might hope for a virtuous wife, but Liam and Grace had no choice but to endure a daughter-in-law like Claire.

Confused by the Blackwoods' odd expressions, Liam and Grace wondered if something was amiss with the arrangements.

Once seated, Mason took the spot beside Nathan but showed none of his usual enthusiasm upon seeing his best friend. Instead, he kept glancing distractedly at his phone.

Is he waiting for Violet to text him?

The room fell into an awkward silence as Evelyn's thoughts echoed in everyone's minds. All eyes darted toward Mason, who sat stiffly in his chair.


Mason's stormy expression said it all. Three days of icy silence toward Violet, yet she hadn't made a single attempt to contact him. What did that mean?

Is she avoiding me out of guilt? Or is this some twisted game? If she cared even a little, wouldn't she at least try to explain?

The more Mason dwelled on it, the tighter his jaw clenched. The wine tasting event suddenly felt suffocating. He nearly bolted from his seat to confront Violet right then—if not for his damn pride holding him back.

Noticing Evelyn practically vibrating with curiosity beside Nathan, the man decided to indulge his wife's gossip cravings. Turning to Mason with feigned concern, Nathan asked, "You seem distracted tonight. Everything alright?"

Mason opened his mouth to vent when he caught Evelyn practically molded against Nathan's shoulder. Though pretending disinterest, her eager posture screamed spill the tea! His words died instantly.

Besides, with all the family elders present, airing dirty laundry was out of the question. "It's nothing."

That's it? Evelyn's disappointed thought rang clear. Ugh, men and their emotional constipation.

Nathan shot her an amused glance, secretly relishing her weight against him. The floral notes of her perfume made him lean closer, unwilling to disrupt their contact—until Evelyn abruptly straightened.

It's happening! Claire's talking to Violet about relationships! Is this the setup? I need to witness this drama firsthand! Her mind raced. How do I get to the second-floor powder room? What excuse would work...

The Blackwood family exchanged glances, equally invested but struggling to find plausible reasons to intrude.

Nathan's fingers twitched. Watching Evelyn's scheming expression, something flickered in his gaze. Before she could devise a plan, his thumb brushed her lower lip.

The familiar touch startled her. What's he—

"Your lipstick," Nathan murmured, wiping nonexistent smudges. Then louder, addressing Mason: "Is there somewhere my wife could freshen up?"

The perfect escape route—delivered by the man who knew exactly what game she was playing.
###Chapter 206: The Art of Strategic Separation

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting a golden glow over the sleek modern furnishings. She stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers wrapped around a steaming cup of coffee, her mind racing with the events of the past few days.

Nathan Blackwood had been unusually distant.

Ever since their explosive argument at the gala—where accusations had flown like daggers—he had retreated into his usual cold, impenetrable demeanor. But Evelyn knew better. She had seen the flicker of vulnerability in his storm-gray eyes before he shut her out completely.

Her phone buzzed on the marble countertop. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant:

"The Blackwood Group just scheduled an emergency board meeting. No details yet, but whispers suggest it’s about the merger."

Evelyn’s grip on her cup tightened. The merger. The very thing that had driven a wedge between her and Nathan.

She exhaled sharply, setting the coffee down. If Nathan thought he could cut her out of this decision, he was sorely mistaken.

Across the city, in the towering Blackwood Enterprises headquarters, Nathan sat at the head of the conference table, his expression unreadable. The board members shifted uncomfortably under his piercing gaze.

"We proceed with the acquisition," he stated, his voice leaving no room for argument.

"But, Mr. Blackwood," one of the older directors ventured cautiously, "without Ms. Sinclair’s final approval—"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "This is my company. My decision."

A tense silence settled over the room.

Then, the doors swung open.

Evelyn stood there, her emerald-green dress a stark contrast to the sea of black suits. Her chin was lifted, her gaze locked onto Nathan’s.

"You forgot to invite me to the party," she said coolly.

Nathan’s eyes darkened. "This isn’t your concern."

"Isn’t it?" She stepped forward, the click of her heels echoing in the hushed room. "Last I checked, I still own twenty percent of this company. Or did you plan to steamroll over that too?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Nathan leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled. "Sit down, Evelyn."

She didn’t move. "Not until you explain why you’re rushing this deal without consulting me."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "Because I don’t need your permission."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a humorless smile. "No. But you do need my shares."

The room held its breath.

Nathan’s expression hardened. "Fine. You want to play this game? Let’s play." He stood abruptly, his towering frame dwarfing hers. "But don’t expect me to hold back."

Evelyn met his challenge head-on. "I wouldn’t dream of it."

The battle lines had been drawn.

And neither of them was backing down.

The moment Nathan spoke those words, a spark of realization ignited in Evelyn's mind.

Wait a second... Is this fate intervening? Even my lipstick seems to know I need an excuse to slip away. Nathan, you absolute gem—you really are my lucky charm!

Without hesitation, Evelyn turned toward Mason with hopeful eyes.

Mason could have easily witnessed Nathan’s discreet maneuver had he been paying attention. But his distraction cost him the moment, and by the time he processed the situation, he was already halfway out of his seat to escort her.

Evelyn quickly waved him off. "No need! Just point me in the right direction. I can manage on my own."

I can’t let Mason come with me. Whether Violet is here to confront him or not, I won’t interfere with destiny. But that doesn’t mean I can’t indulge in a little gossip—just not the kind I start. A professional gossiper has standards, after all.

"Huh?" Mason blinked, caught off guard.

"Don’t worry, Claire’s still in the makeup room. She’ll take care of you if you need anything," Ethan chimed in, having overheard. He flashed Evelyn a warm smile. "It’s the first door on the second floor—can’t miss it. And feel free to explore the house. The garden and rooftop terrace are particularly stunning this time of day."

Evelyn could tell he sensed their boredom. With the other guests yet to arrive and the party not officially underway, the Hampton siblings weren’t exactly the most entertaining company.

Once again, she found herself admiring Ethan. Coming from such a prestigious family, he had every reason to be aloof, yet he remained effortlessly gracious. His respect for Nathan clearly extended to his wife—a courtesy his own wife and younger brother sorely lacked.

She shot him another sympathetic glance. Why does someone this decent have to deal with such a mess? He deserves better.

Eager to seize the moment, Evelyn stood abruptly—so quickly that she didn’t notice Nathan rising as well, trailing after her like a shadow.

Before leaving, Nathan could practically feel the weight of his family’s silent resentment.

Tough luck. He couldn’t exactly drag them all along, even if they wished he would.

And though they knew it was impossible, they could only sit there, silently willing Evelyn’s thoughts to reach them like a live broadcast of the juiciest gossip.

Mason, however, was momentarily stunned as he watched Nathan follow Evelyn without hesitation.

I still can’t wrap my head around this. Since when did Nathan become so... different? What kind of magic does Evelyn possess to change him in just six months?

Julian smirked at Mason, his tone dripping with amusement. "The power of love, obviously. They're married—what do you expect? They’re practically glued together. What about you? Don’t tell me you and your girlfriend are the independent type?"

Mason stiffened, his expression darkening. The comment struck a nerve, and he chose silence over a retort.

From across the room, Genevieve chimed in, her voice light but probing. "Mason, where is your girlfriend? Didn’t she come tonight?"

Another blow. Mason clenched his jaw before forcing out, "She’s busy."

Sophia, lounging nearby, arched a brow. "Wait, you have a girlfriend? Since when?"

Mason nearly groaned.

Did they all have to gang up on him?

Truthfully, only his inner circle knew about his relationship—he’d never made it public. Given his reputation as the Hampton family’s reckless second son, most dismissed it as another fleeting fling. Even his own family barely batted an eye, assuming it wasn’t serious.

After all, they’d heard rumors before—only for Mason to break things off before they even learned the girl’s name.

The Hamptons had long stopped caring.

Just then, guests began arriving in waves. Ethan, ever the dutiful eldest son, nudged Mason toward the entrance to greet them.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had reached the edge of the battlefield—though the real hiccup wasn’t Nathan trailing behind her.

At first, she’d been baffled by his presence, but before she could dwell on it, voices spilled from the half-open door of the makeup room. Clear. Unfiltered.

"You expect me to believe hiring me twice was a coincidence? And at this price? What’s your game? I’m not stupid. I know my so-called boyfriend is the Hampton family’s second son."

Evelyn blinked.

Well. That door wasn’t even shut. And here she’d been planning to eavesdrop like some stealthy spy.

A light tug on her wrist stopped her.

She turned to find Nathan giving her a pointed look—against the wall. Now.

Evelyn nearly laughed.

So the great Nathan Blackwood was a gossip too. Not that she blamed him. Who wouldn’t want to listen in on this conversation?

Ever generous with intel, she pulled out her phone and typed:

[Violet Carter’s inside.]

Nathan’s brows lifted in silent surprise.

Game on.

Evelyn felt a sudden surge of energy and quickly texted Nathan: So your friend pretended to be broke just to win Violet over!

Nathan frowned, his displeasure evident at Mason’s deceit.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. At least they were on the same page—this was entirely Mason’s fault.

If texting weren’t so cumbersome, she would’ve launched into a full-blown discussion with Nathan right then and there.

Inside the room, the conversation continued.

"You knew all along, yet you stayed with him. Of course, a woman like you wouldn’t let go of a Hampton heir. But Mason is just as guilty for lying to you. I apologize on his behalf."

Damn, even an Oscar-winning actress couldn’t pull off this performance! Evelyn thought, itching to see Claire’s expression.

Just then, her phone was snatched from her hands.

She blinked in surprise as Nathan swiftly opened an app, flipped the camera, adjusted the angle, and zoomed in—revealing the scene inside the makeup room on her screen.

Claire stood face-to-face with Violet.

Evelyn gaped at Nathan’s smooth, practiced movements before shooting him an impressed look.

This man is unreal. Since when did he master paparazzi-level stealth?

Nathan’s hand twitched slightly, nearly ruining the shot. His lips curved wryly. It’s just basic physics, really.

Evelyn was thrilled—now she had both audio and visuals of the confrontation.

Heh, can’t blame us for spying when they left the door wide open—Wait. Why didn’t they close it? Are they trying to get caught?

Meanwhile, the Blackwoods, eavesdropping from the floor below, noticed the Hampton women whispering to Grace. Seated nearby, they caught snippets of the exchange.

"Is your hair fixed? Need to go upstairs for touch-ups?"

"No, it’s fine."

"Then I’ll skip mine and mingle with the guests."

Is she— Oh, she totally is! Evelyn realized. Claire was banking on the Hampton women heading upstairs for touch-ups—ensuring they’d witness Violet and Mason’s relationship firsthand. A staged breakup, cutting off any chance of reconciliation.

She’s already Mason’s sister-in-law and ex. Why can’t she stand him moving on?

Claire was playing the long game, deploying every trick to keep them apart.

"I hope you won't hold it against him," Victoria Hayes murmured, her voice laced with quiet desperation. "He never intended to act like this. There are... complications."

Evelyn Sinclair exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around the edge of the polished mahogany desk. The afternoon sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows did little to soften the tension coiling in the air.

"Complications?" Evelyn repeated, her tone edged with skepticism. "That’s what we’re calling it now?"

Victoria hesitated, her perfectly manicured nails tapping an erratic rhythm against her designer handbag. "Nathan isn’t himself lately. You know how he gets when—"

"When he’s backed into a corner?" Evelyn  for her, arching a brow. "Oh, I’m well aware."

A heavy silence settled between them, punctuated only by the distant hum of the city below. Evelyn turned her gaze toward the skyline, her mind racing. She had seen the signs—Nathan’s sudden distance, the clipped responses, the way he’d all but vanished from her life overnight.

Victoria cleared her throat delicately. "He’s trying to protect you."

Evelyn scoffed. "From what? Himself?"

The secretary’s lips thinned. "From things you don’t understand."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn. "Funny. That’s exactly what he said before he walked out."

Victoria’s expression flickered with something unreadable—guilt? Sympathy? Evelyn couldn’t tell, and she wasn’t sure she cared.

"Just give him time," Victoria urged. "He’ll come around."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists at her sides. Time. How much more of it was she expected to give?

She turned back to Victoria, her voice low but unwavering. "Tell Nathan if he wants to explain himself, he can do it to my face. Otherwise, he shouldn’t bother coming back at all."

Victoria opened her mouth to respond, but Evelyn was already striding toward the door, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Behind her, Victoria sighed, pulling out her phone. A single message flashed on the screen:

"She’s not backing down."

A pause. Then the reply came through:

"Then we’ll have to try harder."

###Chapter 207: Mind Games and Whispered Secrets

The morning sunlight streamed through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she absentmindedly stirred her coffee. Her phone buzzed with yet another notification from the celebrity gossip app she'd been obsessively checking all week.

"Another scandal?" Nathan Blackwood's deep voice startled her as he emerged from their walk-in closet, adjusting his cufflinks.

Evelyn quickly locked her screen. "Just checking the weather," she lied smoothly, though her racing pulse betrayed her.

Nathan's knowing smirk told her he wasn't fooled. "The weather in Seraphina Delacroix's love life, perhaps?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned. She'd been caught red-handed indulging in her guilty pleasure - reading the juiciest Hollywood gossip through her unique ability to hear people's thoughts when they were within fifty feet.

"Don't judge," she muttered, taking a defiant sip of coffee. "It's research for my next script."

Nathan leaned against the kitchen island, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. "Tell me, darling, what fascinating tidbits has your... research uncovered today?"

Evelyn hesitated. The latest mental whispers she'd overheard at yesterday's charity gala involved Sebastian Hart's secret reconciliation with his ex-manager Isabelle Laurent - a scandal that would rock the entertainment industry if made public.

"Nothing important," she said finally, though her fingers itched to text her agent Preston Whitmore with the scoop.

Nathan's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Marcus Donovan. As he stepped away to answer it, Evelyn unlocked her phone again, scrolling through the latest blind items.

Her breath caught. There it was - a thinly veiled reference to Sebastian's betrayal of his current girlfriend Seraphina. The poster clearly had inside information.

Evelyn's mind raced. She'd been the only one within mind-reading distance when Sebastian had that private conversation yesterday. Unless...

Unless someone else at that party shared her ability.

The thought sent a chill down her spine. For years, she'd believed her gift was unique. But if there was another mind-reader in Hollywood - one who clearly had no qualms about exposing secrets - then no one's private thoughts were safe.

Least of all hers.

Nathan returned, his expression grim. "We need to talk."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Had he somehow discovered her secret? Or worse - had this mysterious other mind-reader already uncovered her ability and exposed it?

She forced a smile. "What about?"

Nathan's next words would change everything. But before he could speak, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a notification that made her blood run cold:

"Rumor has it one of Hollywood's sweethearts isn't who she appears to be. Stay tuned for tomorrow's explosive reveal about a certain actress with... unusual abilities."

The coffee cup slipped from Evelyn's fingers, shattering on the marble floor.

When Claire's words reached the ears of Evelyn and Nathan, who were eavesdropping nearby, both froze in shock.

They all knew the truth. By all logic, Claire should have been the last person to dare speak it aloud—especially within the walls of the Hampton estate. What game was she playing?

Inside the room, Violet Carter stiffened. At first, she assumed Claire had come to dissuade her on behalf of the Hampton family—a predictable move among the elite. But now, she was utterly baffled by Claire's cryptic words.

"What?" Violet had long stopped caring about reasons or excuses. Yet Claire's audacity left her speechless.

A resigned glimmer flickered in Claire's eyes as she sighed. "The truth is… it's because of his ex. She chose a marriage that would secure her family's future, abandoning the love they once shared. She hurt him, yet he never stopped loving her. His pain runs so deep that now, he distrusts any woman who comes near him—convinced they only want his wealth. That's why he deceived you for so long."

Violet's face darkened, her expression stormier than before.

How dare she say it out loud? Is she insane?

Then it struck her—no one knew about her secret relationship with Mason. If any Hamptons overheard this, they'd never connect the dots to Claire. The sheer audacity! Claire wasn't afraid to wield this truth like a blade, but how could she be certain it would wound Violet?

Nathan frowned, his thoughts mirroring Evelyn's.

At first, Violet had dismissed it as some cruel prank by spoiled heirs.

Now, she realized the real reason for her suffering—another woman's shadow.

Which was worse? The deception, or knowing she was just collateral damage in someone else's love story?

Is this some twisted power play? Evelyn wondered. Claire must be banking on Violet being a hopeless romantic, clinging to Mason despite everything. The best way to break her? Strike at the heart of her devotion.

Just as Evelyn predicted, Violet's devastation was palpable even through the phone screen.

For Violet, this wasn't just betrayal—it was a mockery of everything she'd believed in.

Tsk. Mason is done for.

Violet had agreed to come tonight, but her mind was already made up. Now, with the truth laid bare, Mason had no hope left.

Though Mason was Nathan's closest friend, all he could do was mourn silently for him.

And if Violet discovered Claire was Mason's ex? The disgust would be irreversible.

Nathan doubted Claire would be reckless enough to reveal that. After all, who knew what chaos the truth might unleash?

Violet Carter’s face twisted with anguish as she watched the screen, her fingers digging into the armrest. "He’s just... tormenting himself and hurting everyone around him..."

Claire Morgan’s voice dripped with familial concern, but beneath it lay something darker—a sorrow so personal it seemed to seep from her very bones.

Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood exchanged knowing glances, their expressions unreadable. They knew the truth, and it left no room for sympathy.

Violet, ever perceptive, immediately caught the odd inflection in Claire’s tone—especially when it came to Mason Hunter. Her head snapped up, confusion knitting her brows together.

Claire’s fingers fluttered to the delicate necklace resting against her collarbone, her eyes shadowed with unspoken grief.

The necklace was new. Violet hadn’t noticed it before, but now, under the dim lighting, its intricate design gleamed ominously.

Her breath hitched.

"That necklace is—" Violet’s voice cracked, raw with disbelief.

Claire stiffened, as if realizing her mistake. She averted her gaze, feigning nonchalance. "It—it was a gift from a family member. Does it bother you, Ms. Carter? I’m afraid it’s one of a kind. The materials were... rare. There was only enough for this piece. The scraps might make a bracelet, but I don’t know where it ended up. Otherwise, I’d offer it to you—as an apology for Mason’s deception."

Evelyn frowned.

Why was Violet suddenly fixated on the necklace? And why did Claire react like that—as if it had come from Mason? But how would Violet even know?

Beside her, Nathan shifted. His elbow brushed against Evelyn’s shoulder, startling her. She turned, only to find him staring intently at her wrist—where a delicate bracelet rested.

His fingers closed around her wrist, his touch featherlight as he gestured toward Violet on the screen.

Evelyn blinked, still lost.

Then, the soft strains of a violin drifted up from below—the band had begun their soundcheck.

Nathan leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Violet’s bracelet."

Evelyn’s thoughts stuttered.

It wasn’t the words that derailed her. It was his voice—low, velvety, and laced with something dangerously intimate. The warmth of his breath sent a shiver down her spine, and for a fleeting second, her knees threatened to buckle.

Nathan’s voice was usually cool, detached—beautiful, but devoid of heat.

Not now.

Now, it was the voice of an incubus—dark, seductive, and impossible to resist.

Holy heavens! That voice could make a nun reconsider her vows! Since when did Nathan Blackwood possess such a dangerously alluring tone? It was as if he'd suddenly morphed into some mythical siren, weaving spells with every syllable. I never imagined my husband had this... particular talent hidden up his sleeve.

At that precise moment, Nathan—who had merely intended to relay vital information to ease his wife's burden—found his ears burning a deeper shade of crimson than Evelyn's flushed cheeks. A cocktail of exasperation and self-consciousness twisted inside him. His sharp gaze flicked toward Evelyn, but words failed him. Silence became his reluctant ally.

Downstairs, the Blackwood clan was having a field day with the impromptu drama. Though Evelyn's fragmented mental monologue made deciphering the full context like assembling a puzzle blindfolded, the unexpected revelation about Nathan's... vocal abilities left them utterly gobsmacked. This was not the intel they'd signed up for.

So this is how far he's willing to go to woo his wife? Sophia Blackwood mouthed to her husband, Daniel, eyes wide with scandalized delight. Unleashing his inner incubus?

The family's collective focus on the original gossip derailed spectacularly.

Thankfully, Evelyn was a seasoned professional when it came to mental espionage. Though momentarily derailed by Nathan's sinful voice, she swiftly wrestled her thoughts back on track.

Wait—what did Nathan just say? That bracelet belonged to Violet Carter—the one from when we helped her gather her belongings? But Claire Morgan mentioned it too. Why would she bring that up randomly? Unless... Oh. Oh no. Is this what I think it is?

###Chapter 208 Not Good Enough For You

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tightening around her coffee mug. The city below buzzed with life, but her mind was elsewhere—entirely consumed by the man who had stormed into her world and refused to leave.

Nathan Blackwood.

Just the thought of him sent a shiver down her spine.

Her phone buzzed on the marble countertop, pulling her from her thoughts. Lillian Graves’ name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn, you need to see this," Lillian’s voice was urgent.

Evelyn frowned, tapping the screen to open the link Lillian had sent. The headline blared in bold letters:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Mystery Woman—Is Evelyn Sinclair Out of the Picture?"

Her breath hitched. The accompanying photo showed Nathan exiting an upscale restaurant, his arm draped casually around a stunning brunette. The woman—someone Evelyn didn’t recognize—leaned into him, her lips curved in a smug smile.

A sharp pang twisted in Evelyn’s chest.

She shouldn’t care. She didn’t care.

Except she did.

Her fingers trembled as she set the phone down.

"Damn it," she muttered under her breath.

Before she could spiral further, another notification popped up—this time from Preston Whitmore.

"Emergency meeting. Studio in 30. Be there."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Work. Right. That was what she needed—a distraction.

But as she grabbed her coat and headed for the door, one thought refused to leave her mind:

Who the hell was that woman?

Nathan Blackwood leaned back in his leather chair, his expression unreadable as he scrolled through the same article on his tablet. Across from him, Marcus Donovan—his brother Julian’s agent—watched him with raised brows.

"You’re playing with fire," Marcus remarked.

Nathan smirked, though his eyes remained cold. "She needs a push."

Marcus shook his head. "Or a damn good explanation. Because if Evelyn sees this—"

"She already has," Nathan cut in smoothly.

Marcus groaned. "You’re insane."

Nathan’s phone buzzed. A message from Sophia, his sister:

"What the hell are you doing? Call me."

He ignored it.

This was part of the plan.

Evelyn Sinclair thought she could walk away?

Not a chance.

He’d make sure of it.

At the studio, Evelyn strode into the conference room, her posture rigid. Preston Whitmore and Donovan Sharpe were already there, their expressions grim.

"We have a problem," Preston said without preamble.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What now?"

Donovan slid a tablet toward her. "Mirabelle Diaz—or rather, Seraphina Delacroix—just announced she’s joining the cast of our film. As your co-star."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Seraphina Delacroix—the woman from the photo with Nathan.

Her nails dug into her palms.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

It was a game.

And Nathan Blackwood had just made his move.

At the grand entrance of the Hampton estate, Mason Hunter greeted the arriving guests with practiced ease—first Marcus Prescott and Vivian Grant, followed by Grayson Hart and Gwendolyn Brooks. Then, his gaze landed on Daniel Wright, who stepped out of his car alone.

A ripple of curiosity passed through the gathered crowd.

Vivian tilted her head, her voice laced with playful suspicion. "Aren’t you two supposed to be planning a wedding? Where’s your fiancée? Too good for our little gathering now?"

Daniel’s expression softened, though his tone remained firm. "She’s been struggling with morning sickness. The doctor advised minimal movement, so I didn’t want to risk it."

Marcus smirked, nudging Daniel’s shoulder. "As long as she doesn’t bail on you at the altar, right?"

Laughter bubbled up around them, but Mason’s stiff posture didn’t go unnoticed. Just as Grayson opened his mouth to comment, the hum of an approaching engine cut through the chatter.

Beatrice Holloway and Lucas Thornton stepped out of the same car—an unusual sight, given their complicated family ties.

Grayson whistled. "Well, well. What’s this? A united front?"

Lucas shrugged. "Her cousin’s tied up with the new entertainment venture. I was at Aunt Eleanor’s, so we carpooled."

Beatrice barely acknowledged the teasing. Instead, her sharp eyes zeroed in on Daniel. "Your ring’s . Swing by the boutique whenever you’re free."

Daniel nodded, a rare smile touching his lips.

Vivian clapped her hands together. "Hold on—does this mean Nathan’s the only one who hasn’t commissioned Beatrice for a custom piece yet?"

Lucas groaned. "Must you remind everyone I’m single?"

Marcus barked out a laugh. "Got plans to change that anytime soon?"

Before Lucas could retort, Beatrice cut in, her voice cool. "Actually, Nathan placed an order last week. An engagement ring."

Silence. Then, chaos.

Everyone leaned in, demanding details, but Beatrice—never one for gossip—merely arched a brow. "He wanted something ‘investment-grade.’ The most expensive materials. The highest possible value."

Daniel’s smile faltered. He’d just finalized his own ring design—a sentimental piece, crafted with deliberate symbolism. Cost had never crossed his mind.

And as the group dissolved into speculation, Mason’s grip tightened around his glass, his gaze distant.

Something was wrong.

And it wasn’t just the absence of a certain blonde-haired, sharp-tongued designer at his side.

"Honestly, some people have zero emotional intelligence," Vivian Grant remarked with an exasperated sigh, swirling her wine glass.

Marcus Prescott chuckled in agreement. "I've told him the same thing." Their friend Beatrice Holloway, the renowned jewelry designer, could only shake her head at Nathan Blackwood's rather ostentatious request. "But he insisted Evelyn Sinclair prefers it this way."

The group exchanged skeptical glances, though they didn't press the matter further. The mere fact that Nathan was commissioning an engagement ring was shocking enough. This confirmed what they'd all suspected - his feelings for Evelyn were genuine. The Nathan they knew would have simply bought something off-the-shelf rather than going through the trouble of a custom design.

The whole idea of Beatrice designing jewelry for their partners had started as a drunken joke during their university days. That Nathan actually remembered and honored this pact was both amusing and touching.

"Well, with Daniel and Nathan both engaged, that makes three couples in our group. We're safe now," Vivian said with a playful wink.

"Huh?" Daniel Wright looked up from his drink, confused.

Marcus laughed. "Don't you remember? Both Grayson Hart and Mason Hunter commissioned pieces from Beatrice before? And look how those relationships ended. My darling here is superstitious."

Beatrice shot Vivian an exasperated look while Vivian stuck out her tongue childishly. This earned her a glare from Grayson, who clearly didn't appreciate anyone bringing up his past relationships.

Nearby, Gwendolyn Brooks pretended not to listen, though the conversation reminded her of when Grayson used to make her wear specific earrings during their... arrangements. Now she understood why.

As for Mason Hunter, who'd been unusually quiet all evening, he suddenly stiffened as if remembering something painful. He too had once approached Beatrice about a necklace - meant for Claire Morgan. It would have been their public declaration when she wore it.

But before the necklace was completed, Claire became his sister-in-law instead. When the  piece finally arrived, Mason had been so furious he nearly destroyed it. Coincidentally, it arrived on Claire's birthday. Though he'd planned to ignore the occasion, family pressure forced him to gift it to her - partly out of spite. He wanted her to regret choosing money over him, thinking her discomfort would bring him satisfaction.

Yet the whole incident had affected him more than he cared to admit, making him overlook something crucial...

What a complete jerk! If Mason claimed to truly care about Violet Carter now, no one would believe him. If he really loved her, why would he treat her so...

Upstairs, Evelyn Sinclair was secretly reveling in the gossip, but her anger was boiling over. She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms as she fought the urge to scream.

Downstairs, the Blackwoods were stunned into silence by Evelyn’s outburst. They had all assumed Nathan was pretending to be broke to leech off his girlfriend, but now they wondered—had something even more outrageous happened?

The bracelet Violet Carter cherished so deeply? It was nothing more than scraps from a gift meant for Claire Morgan. Not even a fraction of the original necklace’s worth. And they were dating at the time! Sure, they had just gotten together, but dating meant feelings were involved, right? How could Mason be so cruel, testing her like this? And then giving her that pathetic bracelet as if it were some grand gesture?

Nathan felt a pang of guilt. When he first saw the bracelet, he’d found it odd that a makeup artist would own something made of such rare material. Even if it was a complimentary gift, it was still custom-made.

Now that he knew Violet was Mason’s girlfriend, the pieces should have clicked. But with everything happening at once, he hadn’t connected the dots.

Do you seriously think forgetting your girlfriend’s birthday because you were in a bad mood is excusable? Evelyn’s voice seethed in her mind. You didn’t even bother getting her a proper gift—just dug out some leftover trinket from your car and called it a birthday present. How does that not haunt you?

Nathan exhaled sharply. Honestly, it might have been better if Mason had given Violet nothing at all.

He couldn’t fathom Mason’s twisted logic. Did the man even realize how demeaning and insulting his actions were?

No, wait—of course he doesn’t. Evelyn’s thoughts raged on. You don’t even feel guilty. You actually believe Violet was lucky to receive something so cheap. You lied to her, telling her it was only worth a thousand dollars because you were afraid she’d get greedy and question your fake identity. In your eyes, she’s only worthy of bargain-bin jewelry. Newsflash, Mason—if she weren’t wasting her money supporting a parasite like you, she could buy herself ten of those bracelets without blinking!

Nathan sighed. He was starting to doubt Mason’s so-called affection too.

And the worst part? Evelyn’s fury burned hotter. You made Violet feel sorry for you. She thought you scrimped and saved, taking odd jobs just to afford that worthless bracelet. She treasured it like it was priceless. You’re a damn monster. How did someone like you end up with someone as kind as Violet? What did she do in her past life to deserve this?

Every time Evelyn remembered how Violet had cradled that bracelet like it was the most precious thing in the world, her vision blurred with rage.

You spoiled Claire rotten when you were together, but with Violet, you’re suddenly a miser? Clearly, you think she’s beneath you. So why don’t you go crawling back to Claire? She’s been dropping hints left and right, flaunting your past relationship in Violet’s face. How can you let her down like this? You two deserve each other—shameless, heartless snakes!

Worried Evelyn might combust from sheer fury, Nathan reached out and gently smoothed a hand over her hair, trying to calm her. Internally, he shook his head at Mason and Claire’s disgusting behavior.

Some people didn’t deserve love at all.

Evelyn Sinclair hesitated before daring to glance at her phone screen again. A sharp pang of sympathy twisted in her chest. Violet Carter wasn't just reeling from the shocking revelation about the bracelet—she was also forced to confront the ugly truth about Mason Hunter and Claire Morgan.

Violet staggered backward, her legs threatening to give out beneath her. Her wide, disbelieving eyes locked onto Claire as if seeing her for the first time.

"You… You two…"

Her voice cracked, the words dissolving into stunned silence. The weight of betrayal pressed down on her, making it impossible to breathe.

Evelyn clenched her fists, torn between stepping forward and giving Violet space. The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to suffocate.

Claire, ever composed, merely lifted her chin, her expression unreadable. But Evelyn knew better—she saw the flicker of guilt in Claire’s eyes before she masked it.

Mason, however, looked like a man caught in a storm, his face pale, his usual confidence shattered.

Violet’s lips trembled. "All this time… you lied to me."

Evelyn’s heart ached. She knew what it was like to be deceived, to have trust ripped away in an instant.

Mason reached out, his voice rough. "Violet, let me explain—"

"Explain?" Violet let out a bitter laugh, tears spilling down her cheeks. "What’s left to explain?"

The room fell into a suffocating silence, the kind that made Evelyn’s skin prickle. She knew this wasn’t just about the bracelet anymore—it was about broken promises, hidden affairs, and the kind of betrayal that left scars.

And as Violet turned and fled, Evelyn realized one thing with chilling certainty:

This wasn’t over. Not even close.
###Chapter 209: A Marriage Alliance
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across her marble countertop. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, savoring the quiet before the storm of the day. But her peace was short-lived—her mind-reading ability, an inconvenient gift she'd long struggled with, buzzed to life like an unwelcome alarm.

Across the room, her assistant Lillian Graves fidgeted with a stack of contracts, her thoughts a chaotic whirlwind. "Oh my god, did Preston Whitmore really fire Seraphina Delacroix from the film? And after she publicly gushed about their 'creative synergy' last week? The tabloids are going to feast on this..."

Evelyn nearly choked on her tea. Seraphina Delacroix—the notoriously dramatic actress—had been dropped from Preston's upcoming project? That explained the frantic texts she'd ignored from her agent, Serena Whitmore.

Lillian's mental monologue continued, juicy details unfurling like a scandalous scroll. "Rumor has it Sebastian Hart threatened to quit if they kept her. Guess their breakup wasn't as amicable as she claimed. And now she's clinging to Adrian Cross for PR rehab—pathetic."

A smirk tugged at Evelyn's lips. The entertainment industry was a viper's nest, and she had front-row seats to its most salacious secrets.

Then, unbidden, Nathan Blackwood's face flashed in her mind—his sharp jawline, those infuriatingly perceptive eyes. She hadn't seen him since their explosive argument at the charity gala. But Lillian's next thought froze her mid-sip:

"Mr. Blackwood's assistant just called. He's rescheduling the merger meeting... again. Third time this month. Either he's avoiding Evelyn, or that 'business trip' to Monaco is really a cover for—"

The elevator pinged, cutting off the thought. Speak of the devil.

Nathan strode in, his charcoal suit tailored to perfection, a leather folio tucked under his arm. His gaze locked onto Evelyn, unreadable as ever. "We need to talk," he said, voice low. "Alone."

Lillian's eyes widened, her mind screaming: "Oh. My. God. This is about the pregnancy rumor, isn't it?!"

Evelyn's teacup clattered against the saucer.

Pregnancy rumor?!

Violet Carter would never admit anything. She quickly cut in, "Ms. Morgan, what's gotten into you? There's no need to be so emotional."

Even as she spoke, her stiff expression and guilty demeanor betrayed her.

What could possibly be wrong with Claire? She's been wounded by snakes like you! Evelyn Sinclair watched Violet's performance on the screen, utterly dumbfounded.

If things had gone as Violet initially planned, the Hampton family relatives would have pieced together the truth about Claire and Mason Hunter's past from their conversation. Without seeing their expressions, they would have only heard about Mason's heartbreak—never suspecting that the ex-girlfriend Violet referred to was actually herself.

Nathan Blackwood let out a cold chuckle. Flawless logic. But a truly intelligent person wouldn’t have even mentioned an ex to Claire in the first place. It seems jealousy has clouded Violet’s judgment, making her reckless.

"You… You people are despicable!" Claire could no longer hold back her scathing words.

Violet’s expression darkened slightly, her tone laced with warning. "Ms. Morgan, insulting your employer isn’t very professional, is it? After all, I did help you when you were in need. Shouldn’t you be thanking me instead?"

Claire trembled with fury, her glare sharp enough to cut glass. "If you called me here to do your makeup, then don’t drag me into your petty drama. I have zero interest in your disgusting affairs!"

With that, she turned her back on Violet, swiftly packing her makeup kit. She refused to waste another second on this conversation, preserving her dignity through her work.

The phone screen showed Claire’s silent tears—her pride the only thing keeping her from breaking down completely.

Violet smirked, finally dropping the act as she sneered, "Honestly, it doesn’t matter if you’re only with Mason for the money. He’s just using you to get over me, anyway. But let me make one thing clear—don’t get greedy. Even if he’s promised you the world, it’s only out of spite. The reason I invited you here today? To show you the vast gap between you and this family."

Wow. The audacity. Evelyn’s jaw nearly dropped. Is she seriously deluding herself into thinking Mason’s every move revolves around her? If she’s so confident, why torment Claire? Poor girl, stuck between two lunatics.

Nathan’s expression darkened. So Violet’s doing all this because she’s noticed Mason’s growing feelings for Claire. She doesn’t want him, but she can’t stand the thought of anyone else having him either. Pathetic.

Claire had clearly decided these people weren’t worth another word. She stayed silent, her back rigid.

Satisfied, Violet didn’t press further. "Oh, and since we’re done here, my cousin will be arriving soon for her makeup. I suggest you prepare yourself."

Someone else is coming?

Evelyn and Nathan locked eyes, trying to communicate through subtle glances. The situation was delicate—neither wanted to be caught in this compromising position.

Nathan signaled for a retreat.

Evelyn hesitated briefly, but the sound of Claire’s approaching footsteps forced her decision. She’s coming out. Guess the drama ends here.

The two swiftly slipped away from the scene.

Once safely back in the first-floor lobby, Evelyn scanned the room for the Blackwoods when Nathan suddenly pulled her into a secluded corner.

Her pulse quickened as she noticed Nathan’s intense gaze, his fingers lightly brushing his own lips.

For a moment, her mind blanked. What is he trying to say?

He tapped his lips again.

Slowly, realization dawned—and with it, a flush of embarrassment.

Wait… does he want me to kiss him?

Nathan froze.

Nearby, the Blackwoods—still reeling from witnessing Violet being humiliated by Mason and Claire—were jolted by Evelyn’s accidental thought.

Huh? What? Since when did Nathan become so bold? That’s… unexpected progress!

But shouldn’t there be some buildup? Just straight to a kiss?

Should we sneak a peek? They’re right around the corner…

No, no, we can’t intrude on something like this!

They mentally cursed Evelyn for making them so invested in gossip that they were now tempted to spy on intimate moments.

So… did they kiss yet?

Evelyn’s inner voice cut through their thoughts: Oh! Now I get it—my lipstick. He’s reminding me I haven’t fixed the excuse I used to come upstairs earlier. Ugh, what was I thinking? Why did my mind jump to kissing?

Nathan’s cheeks burned. Ever since I confessed, she’s been so jumpy.

The eavesdropping Blackwoods collectively sighed in disappointment.

Of course it wouldn’t happen that easily.

Evelyn pulled out her compact mirror, quickly wiping and reapplying her lipstick. Then, with a composed smile, she and Nathan rejoined the wine-tasting party.

The moment Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the venue, all eyes turned toward them.

Nathan had always been the center of attention—his striking looks and formidable status ensured that. But this time, Evelyn was no longer an unknown. Her recent appearance on the hit reality show had skyrocketed her fame. Even without a grand wedding announcement, people instantly recognized her.

The crowd quickly put the pieces together. So this is why the actress who caused such a stir in the entertainment industry was under the protection of the Blackwood family’s third son. She’s his wife.

No wonder… Some of them had tried—and failed—to interfere in certain matters before, unable to break through no matter how many connections they pulled. But now it made sense. She’s married into one of the most powerful families. Of course no one could touch her.

Whispers spread like wildfire.

Did you hear? At that last gathering, they say the couple completely shut down some homewrecker trying to break them apart.

I admit defeat. But honestly, is this "Justice Upholder" thing real? Does she actually know metaphysics, or is it just a gimmick?

People were naturally curious, itching to ask questions—if only they were close enough.

Evelyn and Nathan, long accustomed to the weight of countless gazes, ignored the murmurs and made their way to where the Blackwoods were seated.

Surprisingly, Liam Bennett and Grace Collins were still there, clearly eager to maintain good relations with the Blackwoods.

Not that the Blackwoods needed the attention. They would’ve preferred to gossip about their hosts in private, but with the Bennetts hovering, they had to keep their thoughts to themselves.

Just as the couple was about to sit down, a group at a nearby table waved them over—Nathan’s close friends.

They headed over, only to realize Mason Hunter wasn’t among them.

Evelyn’s curiosity spiked. She was genuinely intrigued—would Mason and her cross paths tonight?

Then, as if on cue, she spotted him trudging toward them, his expression weary. A young woman, full of energy, clung to his arm, trying to loop hers through his. But then her phone rang. After a brief conversation, she hurried off.

Before Evelyn could even begin to speculate, Mason dropped into a seat.

Grayson Hart smirked. "So, both Blackwood brothers are marrying into the same family now? Isn’t she Claire Morgan’s cousin?"

A marriage alliance? Between Mason and Claire’s cousin?

The air thickened with unspoken implications.


###Chapter 210

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She stood by the window, her fingers wrapped tightly around a steaming cup of coffee, her mind racing with the events of last night.

Nathan Blackwood had kissed her.

Not just any kiss—it was the kind that left her breathless, her pulse erratic, her body humming with an unfamiliar heat. The memory of his lips against hers sent a shiver down her spine.

What the hell was that?

She exhaled sharply, forcing herself to focus. She had a meeting with Preston Whitmore in an hour, and she couldn’t afford to be distracted. Not when her career was on the line.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Lillian Graves, her assistant:

"Preston just called. He wants to discuss the script changes before the meeting. Also, Victoria Hayes has been asking about you. Again."

Evelyn’s grip on her coffee cup tightened. Victoria Hayes—Nathan’s scheming secretary—was like a persistent shadow, always lurking, always watching.

She typed back: "Tell Preston I’ll be there early. And ignore Victoria."

But even as she sent the message, unease settled in her stomach. Victoria wasn’t the type to be ignored.

Nathan Blackwood sat in his office, staring at the contract in front of him. The merger with Holloway Industries was supposed to be his top priority, but his thoughts kept drifting back to Evelyn.

The way she had melted into him last night. The way her breath hitched when he pulled her closer.

He clenched his jaw. This was dangerous.

A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts.

"Come in," he said, his voice clipped.

Victoria Hayes stepped inside, her heels clicking against the hardwood. "Mr. Blackwood, the board is waiting for your decision on the Holloway deal."

Nathan leaned back in his chair, studying her. Victoria was efficient, ruthless—and far too interested in his personal life.

"Tell them I’ll make my decision by the end of the day," he said.

Victoria hesitated. "There’s… something else."

Nathan arched a brow. "What?"

She handed him a tablet. On the screen was a photo—Evelyn, leaving his penthouse at dawn, her hair disheveled, her lips slightly swollen.

Nathan’s blood ran cold.

"Where did you get this?" he demanded.

Victoria smiled, slow and knowing. "Does it matter? The press will have it by noon."

Nathan stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. "You’re playing a dangerous game."

Victoria tilted her head. "Or maybe I’m just ensuring you don’t forget where your priorities lie."

Nathan’s phone buzzed. A message from Julian, his brother:

"We need to talk. Now."

Nathan exhaled sharply. Whatever Julian wanted, it couldn’t be good.

And with Evelyn’s photo about to hit the tabloids, the storm was only beginning.

Evelyn stepped into the studio, her heels clicking against the polished floor. Preston Whitmore was already there, flipping through the revised script.

"Evelyn," he greeted, his expression unreadable. "We have a problem."

Her stomach dropped. "What kind of problem?"

Preston handed her a tablet. On the screen was a headline:

"Blackwood’s New Muse? Actress Evelyn Sinclair Spotted Leaving His Penthouse at Dawn."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

The photo beneath it was damning.

Preston sighed. "The studio is concerned. This kind of publicity—"

"Is none of their business," Evelyn snapped.

Preston’s gaze hardened. "It is when it affects the film’s image."

Evelyn clenched her fists. She had worked too hard for this role. She wouldn’t let Nathan—or Victoria—ruin it for her.

But as she stared at the photo, one thought echoed in her mind:

Game on.
###Chapter 211 I Can't Believe That Bastard Has Feelings for Violet

Violet wasn’t alone. Luna had dragged her along.

Violet looked pale, visibly uncomfortable as Luna forcibly pulled her into a circle of young women. Claire was there too, poised to introduce a makeup artist to the group.

Violet kept her gaze down, her entire body tense. She could barely hold herself together.

Damn it, the audacity never ends, Claire. Are you really playing with fire like this? Aren’t you afraid everything will collapse? Do you really want to force this confrontation and burn every bridge? How petty can you be?

Aside from Evelyn, the Blackwoods—who knew the full truth—watched the scene unfold with growing confusion. They waited anxiously to see how this would play out.

Violet refused to go downstairs to face Mason, not just because she didn’t want to cause a scene at someone else’s important event, but because the truth disgusted her. She didn’t want to see him at all. Even though she knew he was here—that he might have already spotted her—she still refused to acknowledge him. But what could she do when they were forcing her hand?

"Mason, who are you staring at? Claire or her cousin?" Grayson asked, intrigued.

After all, everyone expected Mason to clash with Evelyn and Nathan. But instead, he’d frozen mid-argument, his attention snagged by something—or someone. Given Mason’s usual temperament, this was unusual.

"Wait, that makeup artist…" Gwendolyn, standing beside Grayson, suddenly spoke up.

Caught off guard, she momentarily forgot to play the innocent act. Grayson should have warned her—he hated when rebounds acted as opinionated as his first love.

Hearing that, Evelyn’s curiosity flared. She turned to Gwendolyn. "You know her?"

The moment her idol addressed her, Gwendolyn ignored her boss’s warning. "Yes! At the last reunion, she was at that hotel. I ran into her in the restroom. Some of her makeup had your autograph, so we started talking. She was working as a makeup artist there that day."

Gwendolyn spoke fast, her words tumbling out eagerly. Within seconds, she’d laid everything out.

Since Violet hadn’t looked over, Mason hesitated, unsure how to react. But Gwendolyn’s words stunned him. His brows furrowed in disbelief. "She was there that day?"

Oh-ho-ho, I bet he’s starting to wonder if that was the day his little secret got exposed.

"What a coincidence," Lucas muttered, frowning.

"Is she a well-known makeup artist in the industry?" Vivian asked. Having been abroad for so long, she wasn’t sure.

Beatrice, however, shook her head. "Never heard of her."

On the other side of the table, Daniel turned to Evelyn with a knowing smirk. "An autograph? So she's your fan? Earlier, you mentioned knowing her—was that true?"

The detective was sharp, no doubt about it.

When Daniel brought it up, Mason immediately whipped his head toward Evelyn. "You know her too?" A creeping unease settled over him. Anything involving Evelyn Sinclair never boded well—he'd learned that the hard way.

But when Evelyn met his gaze, the icy glint in her eyes sent a shiver down his spine.

He could’ve sworn there was something mocking in her stare.

And he wasn’t wrong.

Evelyn had just cursed him out in her head. Only now did it click for her.

This bastard claims to be into Violet? Please. He’s a walking red flag with zero self-awareness.

"Oh, we’ve met," Evelyn said, her lips curling into a playful smile. "She was part of the makeup team for Julian and me during that reality show a few months back. Funny coincidence, huh?"

Nathan caught on instantly, his eyes widening before he turned to Mason in disbelief.

Mason looked like he’d been slapped.

Still acting shocked? Evelyn scoffed internally. How could he not know Violet and I worked together for two whole months? Even if he doesn’t follow gossip, that show was everywhere. They lived together—did she never mention it? Or did he just not care enough to remember? Pathetic.

At this point, the Blackwoods—who had been unintentionally eavesdropping on Evelyn’s mental tirade—exchanged glances.

Julian and Genevieve were especially speechless. Partners of crew members usually knew exactly who they were working with, especially on a hit show. The fact that Mason had no clue was absurd—so absurd that no one had even considered it before.

Looking back now, "speechless" didn’t even begin to cover it.

Seeing Mason still oblivious to his own awfulness, Evelyn’s irritation flared.

Without hesitation, she dropped the bomb. "Violet’s a sweetheart. Talented, hardworking, and tough as nails. Shame her luck with money and men is absolute trash."

"Why do you say that?" Vivian Grant piped up immediately, proving that curiosity was humanity’s universal weakness.

Mason shot her a sharp look, his expression a mix of suspicion and wariness. Was Violet badmouthing him behind his back? Did she secretly resent supporting him? Was she just putting up with him because of his status, then venting to others when he wasn’t around?

He refused to acknowledge the earlier jabs Evelyn and Nathan had thrown at him.

Evelyn leaned in, ready to spill the tea. The entire table leaned with her, hanging onto her every word.

"During our previous collaboration, she once borrowed money from her mentor," Serena Whitmore explained, her voice laced with concern. "The reason? Her boyfriend got into a car accident with a luxury car owner. And instead of handling it like a responsible adult, he escalated the situation—typical hot-headed behavior. She ended up shouldering tens of thousands in debt. Since she didn’t have much savings, she had no choice but to ask her mentor for help. After that, she worked herself to the bone, taking on back-to-back jobs just to pay it off. She was so exhausted she nearly collapsed on set."

Nathan Blackwood’s expression darkened as if a long-buried memory had resurfaced.

With his temper, conflicts were just conflicts. He had assumed Violet Carter was well-off—after all, she never complained. It never crossed his mind to calculate how much she had actually paid, or whether her salary could even cover it.

"What kind of man shoves his responsibilities onto his girlfriend?" Vivian Grant scoffed, crossing her arms.

Beatrice Holloway shook her head in disapproval. "The worst kind. All bravado, zero accountability."

"And she stayed with him?" Lucas Thornton let out a disbelieving laugh. "She must have the patience of a saint."

Each word struck Nathan like a physical blow. His lips trembled, his skin prickling with discomfort. He had never imagined that what he considered a minor incident could be twisted into something so damning in the eyes of others.

Grayson Hart and Daniel Wright exchanged uneasy glances. Something about this story felt eerily familiar.

After the accident, Nathan had ranted to them about the "nouveau riche" driver, dismissing the whole thing as insignificant.

But Serena wasn’t done. "Recently, she’s been struggling with some financial issues again. She tried borrowing from multiple sources—even reached out to her boyfriend—but he just… disappeared on her."

Nathan’s stomach twisted.

###Chapter 212 Your Plan Really Had Me Mentally Drained

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek modern furnishings. She stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absently. The city below was already alive with movement, but her mind was elsewhere—on the man who had occupied her thoughts far too often lately.

Nathan Blackwood.

Just the thought of his name sent a shiver down her spine.

Her phone buzzed on the marble countertop, snapping her out of her reverie. It was a message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

"Meeting with Preston Whitmore in an hour. He wants to discuss the script changes for the new project. Also, don’t forget—dinner with the investors tonight."

Evelyn sighed. The relentless pace of her career left little room for personal distractions, yet Nathan had somehow carved out a space in her mind that refused to be ignored.

She set her cup down and strode toward her closet, her fingers brushing over designer dresses before settling on a fitted navy-blue dress that accentuated her curves. If she had to face another day of negotiations and power plays, she might as well look the part.

Across town, Nathan sat in his office, his gaze fixed on the financial reports in front of him. But the numbers blurred as his thoughts drifted back to Evelyn—her sharp wit, the way her eyes darkened when she was annoyed, the rare, unguarded laughter that slipped out when she thought no one was listening.

A knock at the door interrupted his musings.

"Come in," he called, straightening in his chair.

Marcus Donovan stepped inside, his expression unreadable. "We have a problem."

Nathan arched a brow. "What now?"

"Victoria Hayes is making moves behind the scenes. She’s been in contact with Donovan Sharpe, trying to sway him to her side before the board meeting next week."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Victoria had always been a thorn in his side, but this was a direct challenge. If she succeeded in turning key players against him, the entire merger could collapse.

"Set up a meeting with Sharpe," Nathan said, his voice low and controlled. "I’ll handle this myself."

Marcus nodded and turned to leave, but hesitated at the door. "And Evelyn Sinclair?"

Nathan’s fingers stilled on the desk. "What about her?"

"Rumors are circulating that she might be considering an offer from Holloway Media. If she signs with them, it could complicate things for us."

A muscle ticked in Nathan’s jaw. The thought of Evelyn aligning with Vincent Holloway—a man with a reputation as ruthless as his own—sent a surge of possessiveness through him.

"I’ll deal with it," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Marcus left, and Nathan exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. The game was getting more complicated, and Evelyn was at the center of it all.

He reached for his phone, scrolling through his contacts before stopping at her name. His thumb hovered over the screen.

Then, with a decisive tap, he sent the message.

"We need to talk. Tonight."

Evelyn’s phone lit up with the notification as she stepped out of her meeting with Preston. She read Nathan’s message, her pulse quickening.

She shouldn’t respond. She knew she shouldn’t.

But her fingers moved before she could stop them.

"Where?"

The reply came instantly.

"My penthouse. 8 PM."

Evelyn bit her lip. This was dangerous. Every interaction with Nathan was like playing with fire—exhilarating, intoxicating, and bound to leave her burned.

Yet she couldn’t bring herself to refuse.

"Fine."

She slipped her phone back into her purse, her mind already racing with possibilities. Whatever Nathan wanted, it wouldn’t be simple.

And she was ready for the challenge.

The bizarre incident naturally provoked a mix of disgusted gasps and astonished whispers around the table.

Evelyn Sinclair spoke with such animated enthusiasm that she effortlessly commanded everyone’s attention.

Oddly enough, Daniel Wright and Grayson Hart kept shifting uncomfortably in their seats, their eyes darting toward Mason Hunter. Hadn’t Mason mentioned something about borrowing money earlier? Could this really be just a coincidence?

By now, Mason was drowning in unease. It wasn’t that he thought Evelyn was deliberately mocking him—no, something far worse gnawed at him. If Evelyn had heard about Violet Carter borrowing money despite not being close to her… then could it actually be true?

"I heard she landed a major client today, which saved her from a desperate situation. This must be the place," Evelyn mused before turning to Mason with feigned innocence. "Oh, did your sister-in-law specifically request her? Did she happen to watch my show, admire my makeup, and approve of Violet’s skills? Well, I really owe her one."

Evelyn wasn’t one to play favorites. If she was going to expose Mason, she’d drag Claire Morgan down with him.

Mason’s face cycled through a spectrum of colors, his expression twisting like a storm.

Right. Claire sought Violet out, and now Violet’s at this gathering. Could everything really be this coincidental? His gut churned with suspicion.

"Yes, Claire probably brought Violet here to introduce her to more connections," Evelyn continued sweetly. "Her husband’s useless, so she has to rely on her own efforts to make money."

"I’ll go introduce myself later," Vivian Grant chimed in eagerly. "I’ll keep the poor girl busy so she can forget about that leech."

Beatrice Holloway nodded in agreement, already planning to cozy up to Violet.

Mason’s fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white, humiliation burning through him.

Finally, curiosity got the better of Daniel. "Do you know her?"

Grayson’s brows shot up. "Your face just went through five emotions. Don’t tell me Violet is actually your girlfriend."

The table fell dead silent.

All eyes locked onto Mason as his gaze flickered—yet he didn’t deny it. Slowly, realization dawned on everyone, their expressions morphing into shock.

The air thickened with awkward tension. Those who had just been trashing the "freeloader" now glanced at Evelyn, unsure how to react.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her lips, barely suppressing a laugh before widening her eyes in mock surprise.

"It’s you? No wonder everyone’s been saying Violet’s boyfriend is a parasite. So it’s been you all along—pretending to be broke to test her while living off her, huh?"

Her words struck like lightning. What had seemed like a harmless test now felt like a brutal exposure. And at this table? Loyalties ran deep—everyone naturally sided with their own.

The moment both parties recognized each other, the entire dynamic shifted. Every pair of eyes at the table burned with silent judgment as they stared at Mason Hunter.

Violet Carter's arrival had shattered the fragile peace.

Mason's face turned ghostly pale, his lips pressed into a tight line. His gaze remained locked onto Violet's retreating figure, as if trying to decipher some hidden message in her posture.

The tension grew so thick that Lucas Thornton cleared his throat loudly, desperately attempting to redirect the conversation.

"Wait—does Claire know Violet too? What's her role in all this?"

His clumsy intervention only made things worse.

An uncomfortable silence descended over the group. Vivian Grant was the only one still unaware of the complicated history between Claire Morgan and Mason.

Marcus Prescott, prioritizing honesty over loyalty, leaned toward Vivian and whispered the explosive truth.

Vivian's shocked gasp nearly turned into a scream.

"Are we certain Violet was invited here as a genuine recommendation?" Beatrice Holloway asked coolly. Such arrangements weren't unusual among elite circles—but coming from a supposed friend? That stung differently.

Before anyone could respond, the approaching footsteps made heads turn.

Violet was being escorted directly toward their table.

Murmurs broke out among the group.

In the charged silence, an anonymous voice cut through:

"Mason, are you absolutely sure Violet recognizes you? If you're wrong about this, the moment she reaches this table—"

Mason hadn't taken his eyes off Violet, but she kept her head stubbornly lowered, denying him even a glimpse of her expression.

His mind raced with possibilities. If Violet knew his identity yet came anyway... was this deliberate? Had she orchestrated this encounter?

But that taunting voice shattered his hopeful theories. A sudden, visceral fear gripped him—the sensation of stepping off a cliff's edge with no safety net.

Before he could compose himself, Violet finally looked up.

Their eyes met.

Mason's breath caught, his entire body tensing. But Violet's gaze slid away as quickly as it had found him, dismissing him entirely.

The group's attention volleyed between them, the air crackling with unspoken questions. Whispers erupted like wildfire.

"Did she notice you? Yet she didn't even flinch. She must've been expecting this."
"I thought she'd make a scene right then and there."
"Were you just going to stand there like a spectator at some cheap drama?"

The whispers died as Violet Carter approached their circle.

Mason Hunter's glare could've burned holes through Violet, who refused to meet his gaze. His fingers twitched around his champagne flute, the simmering irritation threatening to boil over.

Questions churned in his mind like a storm: Why had she borrowed money from his family? Why show up at his parents' estate only to ignore his existence? That deliberate avoidance—was it silent reproach or some twisted game?

The frustration gnawing at him stemmed from something deeper, something he couldn't—wouldn't—name.

Across the room, Evelyn Sinclair studied Claire Morgan with barely concealed disgust. The woman's twisted logic never failed to astound.

So this was the grand plan—forcing Violet and Mason into some awkward reunion? Judging by Violet's rigid posture, any reconciliation seemed unlikely.

Just as Evelyn pieced together the scheme, Claire's saccharine voice cut through her thoughts.

"Evelyn! How lovely you could join us." Claire's smile didn't reach her eyes. "I heard Violet here used to be your personal makeup artist. We thought you might... verify her credentials."

What?

Violet had regained some composure, though her smile remained strained. "Ms. Sinclair," she greeted, fingers tightening around her clutch. The title tasted foreign—too intimate for their current dynamic.

Evelyn's mind raced. Why would Claire announce Violet's former employment to these vultures? The implication hung heavy—they doubted Violet's qualifications. But why?

With practiced ease, Evelyn's lips curved into a dazzling smile. "Violet! No wonder Claire's contour looks semi-decent today—I should've known you were behind it."

The crowd blinked in unison. Had Evelyn Sinclair just... complimented Claire Morgan?

Even Claire faltered, wondering if the champagne had impaired her hearing.

Nearby, the Blackwoods nearly choked on their drinks.

As tensions mounted, Richard and Margaret remained diplomatically distant, but the younger guests had no such reservations. Wineglasses in hand, they inched closer—human vultures circling impending carnage.

Violet Carter remained unfazed by the venomous glare Mason Hunter directed at her. Turning to her circle of friends, she remarked with a smirk, "See? Every penny was well spent."

Yet, the expressions among her companions varied—some skeptical, others calculating.

Luna Morgan suddenly spoke up, her voice dripping with feigned concern. "I still find the charges outrageous. Just because we're wealthy doesn't mean we're fools. Mrs. Carter, how much does she charge you for makeup?"

The question instantly drained the color from Violet’s face.

Evelyn Sinclair, caught off guard by the sudden turn of events, quickly consulted her system.

Good grief, my brain feels like it’s shrunk to a raisin. Your little scheme has left me utterly drained.

The Blackwoods: What? She’s just asking about the price. How is that mentally exhausting? Even an assistant makeup artist earns over ten grand per episode, right?

So Claire Morgan had already informed Luna about Violet’s identity. Since Luna was infatuated with Mason, she wouldn’t tolerate their relationship continuing. She was even more ruthless than Claire in forcing them apart. Naturally, she wanted to publicly humiliate Violet and tarnish her reputation—hence this two-faced act. Even though Evelyn had hired Violet at an exorbitant rate of two hundred thousand to help her through financial struggles, they were now weaponizing that price against her. If Evelyn revealed the standard rate, everyone would assume Violet was exploiting the wealthy, treating them like cash cows. They’d brand her as unethical, driven solely by greed. Once this scandal went public, the Hunters would never accept her.

The Blackwoods: No wonder they insisted on Violet coming down. This was a damn trap all along.

A muscle twitched in Nathan Blackwood’s jaw. Honestly, if this kind of scheme were used to secure Ethan Carter’s business empire…

Perhaps their main goal was to embarrass Violet in front of the Hunters, but if they succeeded, they’d also destroy her reputation in the makeup industry. Word would spread, and no wealthy client—no matter how desperate—would hire her again. Even her work with A-list celebrities would be jeopardized. This could annihilate her entire career. They were downright vicious.

The Blackwoods: Vicious? They’re not just vicious—they don’t even see Violet as human. What did she ever do to deserve this? She’s the victim here!

Nathan let out a cold chuckle. His gaze flickered to Evelyn, concern flickering in his eyes—only to find her lips curving into a sly smile.

Don’t blame me. If you’re using me to hurt others, I’ll bite back.

Nathan: My wife is absolutely adorable.

"Can you ask around if you’re unsure?" Luna snapped, clearly impatient with Evelyn’s silence. She wanted this resolved—fast.

Violet’s face had paled further. She understood exactly what was happening, but she was powerless. The charges were real. At this moment, she should have turned to Mason for help—but she didn’t. She didn’t even think of him.

Mason had been watching Violet the entire time. Though he didn’t grasp the full picture, he sensed her distress. He expected her to seek his help. Even if it was just a silent plea—

The tension in the room was palpable. If Violet had just looked at Mason with those pleading eyes of hers, he would have caved instantly—offering her an escape route without hesitation.

Yet, the entire time, Violet stubbornly avoided his gaze.

A soft, knowing chuckle broke the silence.

"Oh, now I remember—it was three hundred thousand per episode," Seraphina remarked casually, her lips curving into a sly smile.

The statement sent shockwaves through the group.

Violet’s head snapped toward her, only to find Seraphina smirking at her with an air of triumph.

Their friends exchanged bewildered glances. Had they misheard? Misunderstood?

"Wait… are rates really that high now?" one of them blurted out.

"So two hundred thousand is considered normal here?" another muttered in disbelief.

"Damn, has my makeup artist been severely undercharging me all this time?"

The rest of the table remained blissfully oblivious, completely missing the underlying tension of the conversation.

###Chapter 213 Who Says I'm Not Entitled

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the latest revisions. The role was challenging—a period drama set in 19th-century England—and she needed to perfect the nuances of her character’s aristocratic accent.

Her phone buzzed, breaking her concentration. A message from Nathan Blackwood flashed on the screen:

"Dinner tonight? I have something to discuss."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathan had been unusually distant lately, ever since that explosive argument at his sister Sophia’s engagement party. She typed a quick reply before she could overthink it.

"Sure. Your place or mine?"

His response was immediate.

"Mine. 8 PM."

She exhaled sharply. That was Nathan—terse, to the point, impossible to read.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan stood in his office, staring at the legal documents spread across his desk. His father, Richard Blackwood, had just dropped a bombshell—the family company was facing a hostile takeover, and Nathan’s inheritance was at stake.

His assistant, Victoria Hayes, knocked lightly on the door. "Sir, your sister is here to see you."

Nathan barely had time to react before Sophia stormed in, her emerald-green eyes blazing. "You’ve been avoiding my calls," she accused.

"I’ve been busy," he said flatly.

"Too busy for family?" Sophia crossed her arms. "Dad told me about the takeover. You’re not handling this alone."

Nathan clenched his jaw. "I don’t need a babysitter."

Sophia’s expression softened. "You need allies. And Evelyn—does she know?"

The mention of Evelyn’s name made his chest tighten. "Not yet."

That evening, Evelyn arrived at Nathan’s penthouse, dressed in a sleek black dress that hugged her curves. The moment he opened the door, the tension between them was palpable.

"You look stunning," he murmured, stepping aside to let her in.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Flattery won’t make me forget you’ve been ghosting me for weeks."

Nathan poured them both a glass of wine before meeting her gaze. "I’ve been dealing with… complications."

"Care to elaborate?"

He hesitated, then handed her a folder. "This is why I’ve been distant."

Evelyn flipped it open, her breath catching as she scanned the contents. "A takeover? Nathan, this is serious."

"I know." His voice was rough. "And I need your help."

Her heart pounded. "What do you mean?"

Nathan stepped closer, his dark eyes intense. "I need you to play the role of my fiancée—publicly. It’s the only way to secure investor confidence and stop the takeover."

Evelyn nearly dropped her glass. "You’re joking."

"Dead serious."

She stared at him, torn between outrage and something dangerously close to hope. "And if I say no?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Then I lose everything."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Evelyn took a slow sip of wine, buying time. Finally, she set the glass down with deliberate calm.

"Fine. But this is strictly business."

Nathan’s lips curved into a smirk. "Of course."

But the way his gaze lingered on her mouth told a different story.

Evelyn Sinclair snapped back to reality under the weight of numerous questioning stares. For a fleeting moment, her carefully constructed mask nearly slipped.

By now, she was absolutely certain Violet Carter had intentionally made those humiliating comments just to provoke her.

A bitter taste filled her mouth. Why did Violet always have to make things difficult? Given Nathan Blackwood's close friendship circle, Violet should naturally align with them. How could she possibly side with outsiders against her?

Hmm? What's with that accusatory look? Is she seriously blaming me? Good grief. The audacity. Is Claire Morgan actually faulting me for not joining her petty bullying campaign?

Evelyn suppressed a shudder of disgust.

As the heated discussion grew louder, Ethan Carter intervened with practiced ease. "Everything alright here?" he asked with his trademark charming smile.

"Just introducing the ladies to a talented makeup artist," Claire forced out through clenched teeth, her smile brittle. "Though Violet's celebrity status apparently commands higher rates than ours. We were merely... discussing the discrepancy."

Ethan smoothly turned to Violet. "Ms. Carter, you've been working hard tonight. Please feel free to sample our wine selection. If any catch your fancy, we'd be delighted to send you home with a bottle."

His words were gracious, yet Violet's responding gaze held something unreadable.

She recognized their shared predicament, yet the gulf between their social standings made any solidarity impossible. The Hampton family's eldest son hardly needed her sympathy.

"You're too generous, thank you." Violet seized the lifeline Ethan offered, eager to diffuse the tension. She refused to let petty drama ruin someone else's important event—or worse, create professional complications for herself.

She made to leave, acutely aware of the hostile undercurrents. These vipers had made their intentions clear, and she wasn't about to remain their punching bag. The makeup room offered safer refuge until this wretched gala ended.

Yet before departing, Violet locked eyes with Evelyn, silently conveying profound gratitude. Notably, she didn't spare Mason Hunter—her own boyfriend standing mere feet away—so much as a glance.

The deliberate snub sent Mason spiraling. The old Violet would've orbited around him like a lovesick moon, her entire world reduced to his presence. This cold indifference? Unbearable. His chest constricted as if gripped by invisible talons.

"Just where do you think you're going?" Mason finally snapped as Violet turned to leave. "Sit. Down."

The command cracked through the air like a whip, drawing every eye in the vicinity.

Oh here we go, Evelyn thought, resisting the urge to facepalm. The classic temper tantrum from Hampton's entitled second son. Could he be any more obvious? He didn't even specify who he was ordering around.

###Chapter 214: Savoring Juicy Gossip in Her Mind

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across her polished mahogany desk. With a steaming cup of Earl Grey in hand, she scrolled through her phone, her lips curling into a mischievous smirk as she devoured the latest celebrity scandal.

"Seraphina Delacroix caught in a love triangle with Sebastian Hart and Adrian Cross?" Evelyn murmured, her fingers tapping rhythmically against the porcelain cup. "Now that's entertainment before breakfast."

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, breezed in with a tablet balanced precariously on a stack of contracts. "You've seen the headlines, I presume?"

"Seen them? I'm already drafting the sequel in my head," Evelyn quipped, swiveling her chair toward the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Manhattan. "Sebastian's manager Isabelle must be having kittens right now. Three years of carefully crafted 'bad boy redeemed' PR down the drain because he couldn't resist texting his ex at 2 AM."

Lillian arched an eyebrow. "The Daily Mail claims Adrian stormed out of Seraphina's birthday party when Sebastian showed up uninvited."

"With orchids," Evelyn added gleefully. "Her favorite. The man's either a genius at emotional warfare or—" Her phone buzzed with an alert. "Oh! And now Harrison Montgomery's wife Natalie has unfollowed Vanessa Sterling on Instagram. The plot thickens!"

Downstairs in the lobby, Nathan Blackwood stepped out of the elevator, his Italian leather shoes clicking against the marble floors. His assistant Marcus Donovan kept pace, rattling off his schedule. "...and your sister Sophia called six times about the charity gala seating chart."

Nathan barely registered the words, his attention snagged by the sight of Evelyn through the glass-walled conference room. She was gesturing animatedly to Lillian, no doubt dissecting some new gossip with the precision of a surgeon. The way her emerald eyes sparkled with mischief made his meeting about quarterly earnings suddenly feel unbearably dull.

Upstairs, Evelyn gasped dramatically. "Wait—scroll back! Is that who I think it is in the background of Seraphina's party photos?" She zoomed in on a blurred figure near the champagne fountain. "That's definitely Preston Whitmore's signature fedora. What's a director doing at an actress's—"

The door swung open.

"Plotting someone's demise or just their social ruin?" Nathan leaned against the doorframe, his tailored suit doing nothing to hide the amusement in his stance.

Evelyn didn't miss a beat. "Why choose when you can multitask?" She spun her phone toward him. "Tell me you wouldn't pay good money to see Sebastian's face when Adrian—"

"Actually," Nathan interrupted, sliding a manila folder onto her desk, "I came to discuss your script revisions. But by all means, prioritize the downfall of C-list celebrities."

Lillian discreetly exited as Evelyn flipped open the folder. "Please. Seraphina's at least a solid B-lister after that perfume commercial." She skimmed Nathan's notes, her playful demeanor shifting into professional focus. "You cut the entire museum heist sequence?"

"It's derivative." Nathan rounded the desk, close enough that Evelyn caught hints of his sandalwood cologne. "But this subplot about the art forger's daughter blackmailing the protagonist? Now that has potential."

Evelyn tapped her pen against her chin, mentally rearranging scenes. Outside, the city hummed with possibilities—both for her screenplay and the real-life drama unfolding across tabloids. Some stories wrote themselves; others needed a more... creative touch.

And Evelyn Sinclair excelled at both.

"What just happened? Did I hear that right? Mr. Mason has been living off her?"

"Shouldn’t it be the other way around?"

"Are they really together?"

The murmurs spread like wildfire as Mason remained silent, his jaw clenched. The tension in the air was palpable, thick enough to slice with a knife.

All bark and no bite, huh?

Nathan watched the scene unfold, his fingers tightening around his glass. This was the first time Violet had ever treated Mason with such icy detachment, and it clearly rattled him.

Violet’s frosty gaze locked onto Mason, who flinched under its weight. He opened his mouth, then closed it again, as if the words had abandoned him.

Then, Luna—Audrey’s scheming cousin—saw her chance.

With a sickly sweet smile, she sidled up to Violet, invading her personal space. Too close.

"Ms. Carter, are you Mason’s girlfriend? Why didn’t you tell us sooner?"

Her voice dripped with false concern, her eyes gleaming with something far more sinister.

Violet took a deliberate step back, her instincts screaming. What is she planning?

"There’s nothing to tell."

But Luna wasn’t done. She pouted, leaning in again—too close, too fast—and Violet’s pulse spiked.

Because behind her, barely an inch away, stood an eight-tier tower of crystal wine glasses.

One wrong move, and—

"Watch out!"

Evelyn’s warning came too late. From her seat, she could only watch in horror as Luna’s shoulder accidentally brushed against Violet’s.

Nathan lunged forward, but he was too far.

Violet, in her heels, teetered on the edge of the steps—

Then the world tilted.

A blur of movement.

The deafening crash of shattering glass.

And a woman’s scream—piercing, raw—ripped through the room.

Chaos erupted.

But whose scream was it?

Violet’s?

Or Luna’s?

"Luna!" Claire gasped, her voice laced with shock. Her furious gaze then snapped to Violet, who stood unharmed.

Violet was just as stunned. She turned to see who had yanked her to safety at the last second.

Damn, I thought some white knight had come to my rescue, but it's just you, Julian! Where the hell did you even come from?

Julian smirked. How is this not heroic?

It had all started with Evelyn’s desperate plea. The three siblings had been mere spectators to the unfolding drama, but when they saw Violet about to take a nasty fall, they’d acted on instinct—pulling her back just in time.

Ironically, Luna, now without her support, ended up being the one to crash spectacularly.

"Everyone, step back!" Ethan barked, rushing over to assess the damage. Amid the shattered glass and spilled champagne, Luna lay in a pitiful heap, sobbing uncontrollably. Thankfully, her fall had sent her clear of the worst of the broken shards, though the tower of glasses hadn’t been so lucky. Had she landed directly on them, she’d have been seriously injured. As it was, she was merely drenched and humiliated.

And that was more than enough.

"Claire, take Luna to clean up," Ethan ordered sharply.

With no other choice, Claire reluctantly helped her reckless cousin to her feet.

"What were you thinking? Have you lost your mind?" Claire hissed under her breath.

"I—I heard you say you wanted to embarrass her at this banquet. That way, the Carters would have to cut ties with them, right?"

"Tsk, you didn’t need to interfere."

Realization dawned on Luna—Claire had already planned something.

With them gone, the crowd began to disperse.

Just as Violet  thanking Julian, Mason had already closed the distance between them. His fingers wrapped around her wrist, pulling her firmly away from Julian.

He’d just learned that Violet had been working closely with Julian for the past two months. Seeing him play the hero now was beyond irritating.

When he tugged her, Violet tried to wrench free.

After handling the mess, Ethan noticed his younger brother acting up again. He strode over and demanded, "Mason, what are you doing with Ms. Carter?"

Annoyed, Mason shot Violet a glare before turning to his brother. "She’s my girlfriend. Is it a crime to want her to meet my friends at my table?"

Even Ethan was taken aback. "Girlfriend?"

"Yes." Mason’s tone was firm, as if expecting Violet to greet Ethan properly.

But Violet remained stubbornly uncooperative.
###Chapter 215 | Unworthy of This

Ethan Carter had no patience for the romantic entanglements of the younger generation. He got straight to the point. "Just treat her right. No more drama. After the wine tasting, introduce your girlfriend to Mom and Dad."

With an apologetic smile to the group, Ethan excused himself to attend to his social obligations.

Violet Carter couldn’t make a scene with Mason Hunter in public, so she reluctantly let him lead her to their table.

An uneasy silence settled over the group—not because they were particularly reserved, but because they were all too eager to witness the brewing storm. Nearby, the three Blackwood siblings lingered by the bar, ears perked for any juicy details.

Mason guided Violet into her seat, and for a moment, neither spoke, as if giving the whirlwind of emotions a chance to settle.

But Violet was already restless. Being near Mason in his current state made her skin crawl.

"Let go of me," she muttered, pulling her wrist free. "I’m still working."

Mason’s temper flared instantly. "Are you deliberately trying to provoke me? There’s a limit to how much attitude I’ll tolerate."

Hopeless.

Nathan Blackwood and his siblings shared the same thought.

Richard and Margaret, too far to hear the conversation but sensing the tension, exchanged glances. What? Who’s hopeless?

Violet turned sharply to Mason, locking eyes with him. "I signed a contract with your sister-in-law for two hundred thousand. I have to prep for today’s event and do the makeup. I don’t have time to sit here drinking and chatting."

Mason wasn’t foolish enough to ask if it was a scam again.

"Did you know who I was before this?" Mason asked, genuinely perplexed. The situation was too tangled—he needed clarity.

"I did," Violet replied with a cold smirk. "Your beloved sister-in-law hired me to work on the day of your class reunion. I saw you there, Mr. Hunter."

Mason missed the sarcasm lacing her words. Instead, he was stunned. "Then why didn’t you confront me? Why ask me for money instead?"

Violet let out a bitter laugh. "I didn’t want to owe you anything before we settled things between us. But I had no choice. I thought even if you were lying to me, you still cared enough to help when I was desperate. But you didn’t."

Mason paled. The memory of rejecting her—the look on her face—choked him. He hadn’t meant for it to happen. There had been nothing when he checked.

"It was a misunderstanding," he said quickly. "I’ll give you the money now. You don’t have to work anymore."

But Violet was already standing. "Too late."

The words hung between them, sharp as a blade.

And with that, she walked away.

The air between them grew thick with tension as Violet Carter finally spoke the words she'd been holding back. "It's too late. I've already received my payment, and I've saved enough money. I don't need your help anymore, Mason. I don't need you."

Mason Hunter froze, his expression darkening. "What the hell are you saying?"

"You asked why I didn't confront you sooner?" Violet's voice was steady, though her fingers trembled slightly. "I was waiting for you to come clean. That was the last chance I was giving you."

Last chance? The confession he'd planned for her birthday—now it meant nothing.

"What do you mean, last chance?" Mason's voice cracked, his composure unraveling. His hands clenched into fists at his sides.

"I wanted to do this privately," Violet continued, her gaze unwavering. "But since the man I thought I was dating never really existed, it's like I was never in love at all. So, Mr. Hunter, stop pretending you're my boyfriend. You never were."

The words hit Mason like a physical blow. His chest tightened, a storm of disbelief and anger brewing beneath the surface.

"What do you mean I don’t exist? I’m right here! Shouldn’t you be—"

"You can't seriously believe that after two years of lying to me—pretending to be broke when you're filthy rich—I'd just celebrate the truth?" Violet's laugh was sharp, bitter. "Did you think I'd throw myself into your arms and thank you?"

Mason's face paled. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. His voice dropped to a near whisper, rough with emotion. "I just wanted you to have a better life."

"Mr. Hunter, I do want love. But not the kind you're offering—not built on lies." She straightened, her resolve hardening. "And I will have a better life. Just not with you. So consider this goodbye. Don’t contact me again."

With that, she reached into her bag and pulled out a delicate silver bracelet—one Mason had given her months ago. She set it down on the table between them with deliberate finality. "I don’t deserve this. It’s yours."

The moment the bracelet touched the surface, Beatrice Holloway—Deborah—gasped, recognition flashing in her eyes. "Is that—?"

Lucas Thornton, standing beside her, quickly gripped her arm, silencing her. He knew exactly what that bracelet was—a prize, something Deborah had designed for a high-profile auction.

Lucas shot Mason a disbelieving look. You treated her like a trophy, and now you're acting heartbroken?

Just as Violet turned to leave, a commotion erupted from the staircase. A panicked voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

"Someone stole Claire’s necklace! Where’s the makeup artist? She hasn’t left, has she?"

###Chapter 216 Flirt With Me
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her velvet chaise, sipping her matcha latte, when an unexpected wave of thoughts crashed into her mind.

"Oh my god, did you hear? Nathan Blackwood was seen leaving Seraphina Delacroix’s penthouse at 3 AM last night!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. That voice—sharp, gossipy, unmistakably belonging to Lillian Graves, her ever-dramatic assistant. But Lillian wasn’t even in the room.

Then another voice, hushed but dripping with excitement: "I bet Vanessa Sterling is fuming. She’s been trying to claw her way into Nathan’s orbit for months."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her cup. Since when could she hear people’s private thoughts? And why were they all about him?

A third voice chimed in, this one smug. "Please, Harrison Montgomery’s wife, Natalie, is the real victim here. Rumor has it she’s planning to leak Seraphina’s old scandal to the press as payback."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. This wasn’t just idle chatter—it was a full-blown celebrity war, and somehow, she’d been thrust into the middle of it.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Preston Whitmore, her director: "Emergency meeting. Studio in 30. Wear something that says ‘I’m above the drama.’"

Too late for that.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, tossing her phone aside. If she could hear these thoughts, who else’s secrets were floating around? And more importantly—could she use them to her advantage?

A slow smirk curled her lips. Hollywood’s elite had no idea what was coming.

In mere moments, whispers spread like wildfire through the crowd. The missing item—a million-dollar birthday gift from Mason to Claire—had become the center of attention.

At the mention of the necklace, both Violet and Mason’s expressions darkened.

Bolstered by Claire’s silent approval, Luna stepped forward, her voice dripping with accusation. "If you’ve got nothing to hide, why not let us check your bag? Something’s not right here."

Mason’s jaw clenched as he shot back, "Are you deaf? I said no. She’s my girlfriend. If she wanted something, I’d give it to her. Why would she steal a damn necklace?"

Violet crossed her arms, her tone icy. "Why am I the first suspect the moment something goes missing? Since when do I have to prove my innocence based on baseless accusations?"

A knot of unease twisted in Violet’s stomach. She knew all too well how Claire and Luna operated—their hostility wasn’t new.

Then, Luna’s sharp gasp cut through the tension. "Wait—this bracelet!" She snatched it off the table, holding it up like evidence. "It matches Claire’s necklace! Whose is this? Yours, isn’t it?"

Violet’s fingers curled into fists. "I just returned it to Mason."

"So it was yours," Luna crowed triumphantly.

Claire’s lips curved into a faux-sympathetic smile. "I remember now. Mason gave me the necklace—and this bracelet was part of the set. Is this the same one?"

The room erupted.

Murmurs swirled into a single, damning verdict: "He gave the main piece to Claire and the cheap match to his girlfriend? No wonder he keeps her hidden. She’s just a placeholder."

The words hit Violet like a slap. Even though she’d ended things with Mason, the humiliation burned fresh. That bracelet—once treasured—now felt like a brand of shame.

Mason stiffened, guilt clawing at his chest. He’d never meant for it to go this far. His gaze darted to Violet, but he couldn’t meet her eyes. Instead, he glared at Claire and Luna, fury simmering beneath the surface.

"If you were upset with Mason, you could’ve just told me," Claire purred, playing the wounded innocent.

"She’s still a thief," Luna snapped. "Probably took the necklace out of spite—thinking he didn’t value her enough."

The air thickened with tension, the unspoken truth hovering just out of reach.

The tension in the room thickened after Violet Carter's bold declaration. Even if she was Mason Hunter's girlfriend, her alleged theft suddenly seemed almost forgivable—or at least, that was the impression she wanted to give.

"Both of you, shut up!" Mason snapped, his temper flaring. But before he could say another word, Liam Bennett and Grace Collins cut him off sharply.

"How dare you speak to Claire like that!" Liam defended Claire Morgan, his tone icy.

Grace, her eyes flashing with disapproval, added, "If your girlfriend took it, just return it. We won’t make a scene about it."

Liam and Grace knew Mason well. His outburst only confirmed their suspicions—he was embarrassed, likely because Violet had stolen something. What else could make him react so defensively? A lovers' quarrel was one thing, but ruining their wine-tasting evening was another.

Violet’s eyes welled with tears. "Dad, Mom, don’t you believe—"

Before she could finish, Luna Morgan lunged forward, snatching Violet’s bag. With practiced ease, she upended it, sending its contents scattering across the floor. Lipsticks, receipts, and a compact mirror tumbled out—and then, with a soft clink, a dazzling necklace landed at their feet.

The room fell silent.

The necklace gleamed under the chandelier, its craftsmanship unmistakably matching the bracelet Claire had been wearing earlier.

Mason stared at it, stunned, before turning to Violet with a mix of confusion and betrayal.

Violet’s breath hitched. She had braced herself for this moment, but panic still clawed at her throat. "It wasn’t me," she insisted, voice trembling. "Someone framed me!" Then, her gaze snapped to Claire. "You did this!"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. But Violet’s accusation only made her look more desperate. Who would believe Claire would plant her own jewelry just to set Violet up? The idea was absurd.

Claire sighed, feigning hurt. "I don’t blame you for taking the necklace to pick a fight with Mason. But accusing me when you’re caught? That’s low."

Violet’s restraint shattered. "You planted it! You slipped it into my bag when I wasn’t looking—because you—!"

Evelyn Sinclair, watching from the sidelines, nearly bounced on her toes. Yes! Say it! Blow this whole thing wide open! If everything went down in flames, so be it—at least no one would walk away unscathed.

But Violet didn’t finish. Instead, she turned to Mason, her voice breaking. "She framed me. Do you believe me?"

Evelyn groaned internally. No! Why ask him to choose sides now? Weren’t you done playing the lovesick fool?

To everyone else, it looked like a plea for her boyfriend’s trust.

But Nathan Blackwood saw something else entirely.

Violet Carter knew the stakes were high. If she dared expose the scandalous affair between Mason Hunter and Claire Morgan, she needed irrefutable proof. Without it, she’d be crucified—accused of fabricating the connection between the necklace and bracelet just to save her own skin.

But proof? She had none. Unless Mason himself stepped forward and admitted his past with Claire, this could very well be Claire’s elaborate trap.

Yet, if Mason did that, he’d shatter the fragile peace of the Hampton family. And Violet had long stopped trusting him. She wasn’t foolish enough to gamble on his loyalty—not when she couldn’t even vouch for herself.

The incident had happened in the makeup room, a place with no cameras, no witnesses. Even if she screamed her innocence, claiming she’d been framed, it wouldn’t matter. In the court of public opinion, she was already guilty.

The simplest setups were the hardest to escape.

Despair settled over her like a suffocating fog. Her only lifeline? Mason. So she did what she did best—adapted. She turned to him directly, her voice trembling with desperation.

"Do you believe me?"

If he said yes, it meant he doubted Claire’s actions. That alone could save her. But if he didn’t… well, then there was no point in explanations.

Nathan Blackwood watched the scene unfold with detached amusement, his fingers tapping idly on his phone. He already knew the answer.

Mason, however, froze at Violet’s question. His gaze flicked to Claire, who stood there with red-rimmed eyes, her lips quivering as if holding back tears.

The truth? He didn’t know. His resentment toward Claire stemmed from his secrets being exposed—not because he thought her capable of something like this.

Violet was outright accusing Claire of being a criminal. And Mason was torn. The woman he’d once loved couldn’t possibly be a villain in his mind. Instinctively, he wanted to believe Claire.

But he also trusted Violet. There had to be a misunderstanding. Maybe the necklace had fallen in accidentally? Or—his eyes narrowed—maybe it was Luna Morgan’s doing. Yes, Luna. She’d been acting suspiciously from the start.

Instead of answering Violet, he turned on Luna.

"Did you do this?" His voice was sharp, accusatory. "You found the necklace too easily. Were you the one who planted it? You were in the makeup room—it had to be you."

His deflection spoke volumes. He trusted Claire. He trusted Violet. And in doing so, he’d just sealed Violet’s fate.

The moment Mason spoke, not only did Luna throw a tantrum, but Violet let out a sharp, icy laugh. "Fine, let's call the police then. I'd love to prove my innocence to them."

The crowd gasped, stunned by the escalating tension. Was she truly innocent, or just stubbornly refusing to admit guilt?

Daniel cleared his throat, ready to step in. As an officer on duty, he found the situation intriguing.

But Violet’s suggestion was swiftly shut down. Liam and Grace intervened, saying, "There’s no need for the police. We won’t press charges. The necklace has been found—that’s all that matters. Mason, talk some sense into your girlfriend."

Mason hesitated. Dragging family drama into a police station was undignified. Spotting Daniel about to rise, he gripped his shoulder, stopping him. Finally, he turned to Violet with a frustrated sigh. "Enough. I believe you. Let’s drop this. We’ll explain everything to my parents—they’ll believe you too."

Tears welled in Violet’s eyes. "So, everyone here will believe I’m innocent? Can you guarantee that if rumors spread, my reputation won’t be ruined?"

Mason’s expression darkened. "Isn’t my trust enough? I’ll make sure you’re taken care of. But if you keep pushing, can you really prove yourself? Don’t dig your own grave."

His concern was clear—if Violet failed to prove her innocence, she’d be branded a criminal. Better to let it go.

Evelyn watched, disgusted. How noble of you—sacrificing the weakest link for the sake of peace. In your eyes, Violet is disposable. Pathetic. And Daniel—aren’t you a cop? Do something! The rest? All Mason’s friends, bound by family ties and loyalty. No one’s going to betray him for a stranger.

Violet’s tears spilled over.

She knew if this was swept under the rug, her name would be dragged through the mud. No one’s going to help me. A miracle won’t just fall from the sky.

She didn’t know anyone here. Then, an image flashed in her mind—Evelyn, champion of female artists, the woman who’d helped her before.

But doubt crept in. Would Ms. Sinclair even bother? There’s no way out of this.

Evelyn’s heart sank. Her status kept her from intervening—without proof, she was powerless.

She shot Nathan a glance, but asking him to expose his own friend was unfair. Besides, exposure wouldn’t solve anything.

Nathan caught her look. "What’s wrong?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, irritation simmering.

Nathan's lips curled into a playful smirk as his fingers brushed against Evelyn's chin, tilting her face upward. The sudden contact sent a jolt through her, her breath hitching in surprise.

Evelyn blinked, her heart pounding against her ribs. Is he seriously flirting with me right now?

Nathan hesitated for a split second before his expression softened. With a teasing pinch, he turned her head toward the massive screen at the far end of the room.

The display, which had been looping promotional clips of rare vintage wines, flickered abruptly. A deep, resonant voice filled the space.

"What is this necklace?"

Every head in the room swiveled toward the screen, conversations dying mid-sentence.

###Chapter 217: Savoring Juicy Gossip in Her Mind

The morning sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden patterns across her marble floors. As she sipped her lavender-infused tea, her phone buzzed incessantly with notifications from her exclusive celebrity gossip group chat. A wicked smile curled her lips as she scrolled through the latest scandal involving Seraphina Delacroix and Sebastian Hart.

"Tsk, tsk," Evelyn murmured to herself, her manicured nails tapping against the porcelain cup. "Seraphina really thought she could keep her affair with Adrian Cross under wraps?" The irony was delicious—Seraphina had publicly denounced cheating just last month during her interview with Glamour Elite.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, entered with a tablet balanced precariously on a stack of contracts. "You’re going to love this," Lillian said, her eyes twinkling with mischief. "Vanessa Sterling was spotted leaving Harrison Montgomery’s penthouse at 3 AM last night. Natalie Whitaker’s PR team is already scrambling."

Evelyn’s laughter rang out like wind chimes. "Oh, this is gold." She leaned forward, her silk robe slipping off one shoulder. "Tell Preston Whitmore to leak those photos to Star Stalker—anonymously, of course. Let’s see how Harrison spins this one."

Lillian hesitated. "But what if—"

"Darling," Evelyn interrupted, swirling her tea, "in this industry, the only currency better than money is leverage. And right now?" She smirked. "We’re rich."

As Lillian hurried off, Evelyn’s gaze drifted to the framed photo on her desk—her and Nathan Blackwood at last year’s Met Gala, his arm possessively around her waist. A flicker of something unreadable passed through her eyes before she schooled her features into cool detachment.

"Speaking of secrets," she muttered, opening a hidden folder on her phone. The screen illuminated with a candid shot of Nathan and Victoria Hayes at a secluded café. The timestamp? Two days after he’d canceled their anniversary dinner, claiming a "business emergency."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. Oh, she’d let him dig his grave a little deeper. And when the time was right? She’d bury him in it.

Her phone pinged again—a breaking alert from Celeb Insider: "Mirabelle’s Ex Drops Bombshell: Sebastian Hart Claims She Faked Pregnancy for Role."

Evelyn’s grin turned feline. "Popcorn, anyone?"

The video recording had been entirely accidental. When Nathan pulled out his phone, he'd been operating it one-handed. Just as he raised it, Evelyn's teasing remark about his "paparazzi skills" made his fingers slip, pressing directly against the screen. Only when he tucked the phone away did he realize the footage had automatically saved.

Perhaps influenced by his family's casual attitude toward such things, he didn’t delete it immediately. If his relatives wanted to see it, he could always send it to the group chat later.

Initially, he’d hoped to capture something useful—anything that might serve as leverage. Instead, he’d caught this.

Now, with the situation spiraling beyond control, Nathan forwarded the video to Julian, instructing him to handle it discreetly. Given their public ties and shared interests, direct intervention wasn’t an option. But behind the scenes? That was a different story.

On the large screen, the clandestine recording played—a confrontation outside the door, voices laced with tension, words heavy with implication.

The shock in the room was palpable. No one moved to stop the footage.

When Claire laid bare the truth—why Mason had pretended to be poor—his entire body stiffened.

Even if he was stubborn, he wasn’t stupid. If Violet ever discovered he’d been testing her, manipulating her, all because of his ex-girlfriend? It would be catastrophic.

A cold dread slithered down Mason’s spine. Only now did he truly grasp that Violet’s talk of breaking up wasn’t just an empty threat.

Certain details in the exchange made Ethan snap his head toward Claire, his eyes widening in horrified realization.

The moment the video mentioned the necklace, Claire’s exaggerated reaction was impossible to miss. She hadn’t admitted anything outright, but her expressions and body language told the whole story.

"Oh my god—is this what I think it is?"

"Pretty sure we’re all thinking the same thing."

"This is insane."

"So Claire and Mason were classmates?"

"Wait—the ex-girlfriend they’re talking about is actually Ethan’s wife?"

"Claire left Mason for Ethan because he was the better prospect."

"Seriously? The Hampton family is okay with this? Two brothers sharing the same woman? That’s disgusting."

The evidence was undeniable. Claire had been subtly sabotaging Mason and Violet’s relationship from the start.

And now, everyone knew.

The whispers in the room grew louder, sharp enough to cut through the tension.

"Maybe they never really got over each other. Sneaking around behind Ethan’s back all this time."

"So Claire was cheating on Ethan?"

"What about the stolen necklace then?"

"This was just petty jealousy. She went out of her way to ruin someone else’s life."

"Talk about wanting it all. The Hampton family praised Claire like she was perfect, and look how she turned out."

Ethan’s expression darkened, his icy glare sweeping over Mason and Claire.

Mason stood frozen, staring at Violet, his face drained of color.

Meanwhile, Violet watched the screen in stunned silence. She had no idea who had recorded the footage, but it felt like divine intervention.

Claire seemed to snap out of her daze, her voice shrill as she shouted, "Who played this? Turn it off! Someone turn it off now!"

Everyone assumed her panic was guilt over her affair with Mason.

Then, gasps erupted through the crowd.

"It really was a setup."

Claire felt like lightning had struck her.

The video showed the moment clearly—after their conversation ended, Violet turned away, and Claire smoothly slipped her own necklace into Violet’s bag.

Every second of the crime was captured. The malice was undeniable.

Claire’s mouth opened, but no words came out. She had no defense.

Her world was crumbling around her.

She knew—it was over.

Her eyes burned as she stared at the screen, unable to comprehend how everything had unraveled.

"Claire?" Grace’s voice trembled with disbelief. She grabbed Claire’s arm, shaking her slightly.

Liam looked ready to explode with fury.

Both the scandalous affair and the public exposure of her scheme would make the Hamptons the laughingstock of high society.

Arthur and Violet Morris, Claire’s parents, stood among the crowd. They knew about Claire’s past with Mason but had dismissed him as a spoiled, worthless heir. They had pushed her to marry Ethan instead.

They never expected their usually cunning daughter to be exposed like this.

The room buzzed with judgment, whispers slicing through the air like knives.

Claire’s perfect façade had shattered.

And there was no coming back from this.
###Chapter 218: A Stolen Kiss

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Liam Bennett and Grace Collins were seething, their faces flushed with fury. The looping video on the screen left no room for excuses—only humiliation. Arthur and Violet Morris, sensing the storm brewing, stepped forward with weak, trembling voices. "This is all just a misunderstanding—surely, a misunderstanding!"

But their words were hollow, drowned out by the damning evidence.

Mason Hunter and Claire Morgan stood frozen, their minds racing for an escape that didn’t exist. The expressions on Ethan Carter’s face—disbelief, betrayal, disgust—only fueled their panic. When others reached out, trying to diffuse the situation with false familiarity, they were shoved away violently.

The video played again, nearing its end. Claire’s face burned with shame, her blood roaring in her ears. She had never felt so exposed, so violated. Every whisper in the room was a knife twisting deeper.

If only I could faint. If only this nightmare would end.

But her body refused to grant her that mercy.

She was a spectacle now, stripped bare before the crowd. The same whispers she had once reveled in—when they were directed at Violet Carter—now clawed at her skin.

How ironic.

She had stolen the spotlight from Violet, but not in the way she’d wanted.

"The more I look at her, the more disgusting she becomes."

"A calculated performance from start to finish. And she played her part so well."

"She’s beautiful, but her heart is rotten."

"She tried to frame an innocent makeup artist. If she’d succeeded, Violet would’ve been ruined."

"The Hamptons must be blind. Bringing a viper like her into their family—what were they thinking?"

"She broke Mason’s heart and tricked Ethan into marriage."

"Mason’s a fool too. How could he let his ex marry his brother? Was he that desperate to play the victim?"

"Honestly, the only victims here are Ethan and Violet. They never stood a chance against these two."

Even Ethan, usually unshakable, looked like the ground had been ripped from beneath him.

His wife. His brother.

The betrayal was too much.

For Violet, though—the truth was a relief. The weight of their lies had nearly crushed her, but now? Now she could finally breathe. Watching the people who had tried to destroy her squirm under the spotlight?

Poetic justice.

Meanwhile, the rest of the room sat in stunned silence.

The game was over.

And Claire had lost.

"They what?" Vivian Grant gasped, her eyes widening in shock. She'd been completely unaware of the situation until now.

"I can't believe it's really Claire Morgan. How did things come to this?" Beatrice Holloway murmured, equally stunned.

The atmosphere in the room grew heavy. Everyone wore somber expressions, witnessing the downfall of someone they once knew.

"Seems like my presence isn't necessary anymore," Daniel Wright hesitated before adding, "I wonder who leaked this video..."

His voice trailed off as his gaze involuntarily shifted toward Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair. There was no obvious evidence pointing to them, but the timing was too perfect—who else would risk angering the Hampton family just to clear the name of a mere makeup artist?

Daniel had only ever seen such bold yet satisfying justice from one particular person.

His suspicions were confirmed when he caught the faint smirk curling at the corner of Nathan’s lips. Meanwhile, Evelyn stood frozen, staring at the screen in disbelief.

Then, realization struck her.

Evelyn whirled toward Nathan, her eyes alight with sudden understanding just as he opened his mouth to speak.

A rush of exhilaration surged through her. Without hesitation, she flung herself into his arms, pressing a fierce kiss to his cheek.

"Nathan! You're incredible!"

###Chapter 219: Three Days to Settle the Debt

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting a golden glow over the sleek marble countertops. She sipped her espresso, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp autumn air. Her phone buzzed—another notification from Gossip Insider.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a smirk as she scrolled through the latest headline:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Elite Hotel with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

The accompanying photo was grainy but unmistakable. Nathan, dressed in his signature tailored suit, his dark hair slightly tousled, held the door open for a statuesque blonde. Evelyn’s pulse quickened, though she refused to admit why.

"Pathetic," she muttered to herself, tossing the phone onto the couch. "Since when do I care about his late-night escapades?"

But her mind betrayed her. Fragments of memories surfaced—Nathan’s deep laugh at that charity gala, the way his fingers had brushed against hers when passing her a glass of champagne. No. She shook her head sharply. He’s just another rich playboy. Nothing special.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, breezed in, balancing a tablet and a caramel macchiato. "Morning, Evelyn. You’ve got a script review at eleven, lunch with Preston Whitmore, and—"

"Cancel the lunch," Evelyn interrupted, her tone sharper than intended.

Lillian blinked. "But it’s about the lead role in Midnight Whispers—"

"I said cancel it." Evelyn stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. "I need to… clear my head."

Lillian hesitated, then nodded. "Of course. Should I reschedule?"

"No." Evelyn grabbed her coat, her mind already racing. There was only one place she could go to drown out the noise.

The Velvet Lounge was nearly empty at this hour, its plush booths and dim lighting a sanctuary for the city’s elite who preferred discretion. Evelyn slid into her usual corner, ordering a martini—extra dry, two olives.

She barely noticed when the seat across from her was occupied.

"Rough morning?"

Evelyn’s gaze snapped up. Nathan Blackwood lounged casually, his emerald-green tie slightly loosened, a smirk playing on his lips.

Her fingers tightened around her glass. "What are you doing here?"

"Same as you, I imagine." He signaled the bartender. "Scotch. Neat." Then, leaning forward, his voice dropped to a murmur. "Though I doubt you’re here because of a certain misleading headline."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. He knew she’d seen it.

"That woman," he continued, swirling his drink, "was my sister, Sophia. She flew in from Paris last night."

Evelyn scoffed. "You expect me to believe that?"

Nathan’s smirk faded. His eyes—usually alight with mischief—turned serious. "I don’t care what you believe, Evelyn. But I do care that you’re letting gossip dictate your opinion of me."

The air between them crackled. Evelyn opened her mouth to retort—

Then her phone buzzed again.

Breaking: Harrison Montgomery’s Secret Affair Exposed—Photos Inside!

Nathan’s brow arched. "Seems like you’re not the only one with drama today."

Evelyn groaned. Not Harrison again.

But before she could react, Nathan snatched her phone, his grin returning. "Tell you what. Let’s grab lunch. I’ll fill you in on Harrison’s real scandal… and you can stop pretending you hate me."

Evelyn’s heart stuttered. Damn him.

"Fine," she said, snatching her phone back. "But you’re paying."

Nathan’s laughter followed her out the door, warm and infuriatingly familiar.

For any married woman, being publicly disowned by her husband and sent back to her parents was the ultimate humiliation.

Evelyn Sinclair clutched at her last shred of dignity, but what she hadn’t anticipated were the brutal words that followed from Ethan Carter. Her breath hitched as terror seized her. How had he uncovered her carefully buried secrets?

Unlike Mason Hunter, Ethan wasn’t so easily fooled.

Evelyn’s face drained of all color, turning a sickly shade of white—paler than a corpse left in the morgue for days. Tears streamed down her cheeks, but no sound escaped her lips. She couldn’t even breathe properly.

And then—she collapsed.

Chaos erupted instantly.

Did she really faint, or is this another act?
She actually passed out!
Some people can’t handle the consequences of their own schemes. How dare they hurt others so carelessly?

The Blackwood family exchanged glances, shaking their heads in silent judgment. Karma’s a bitch.

Arthur and Violet Morris rushed to their daughter’s side, crying out in panic. Desperate, they turned to Ethan for help—but one look at his icy indifference told them everything. There was no saving this marriage.

Meanwhile, Liam Bennett and Grace Collins were still reeling from the shocking revelations. Exhausted and humiliated, they had no energy left to salvage their family’s reputation. They certainly didn’t want anything more to do with the daughter-in-law who had dragged their name through the mud.

As for Mason? He was too busy drowning in his own mess to care about anyone else.

In the end, Arthur and Violet left the Hampton estate in disgrace, carrying their unconscious daughter between them.

Everyone knew the divorce papers would be signed the moment they stepped outside.

Just like that, the wine-tasting event was ruined. But Ethan, ever the composed host, smoothly ushered the guests out, gifting each a bottle of premium wine as an apology for the scandalous scene.

Though the Hamptons had been thoroughly embarrassed, Ethan’s handling of the situation earned reluctant respect. With a man like him at the helm, the family’s reputation would survive—even if they were the talk of high society for weeks.

As the Blackwoods prepared to leave, Ethan approached them, holding out a bottle.

"May I ask why?"

The question hung heavy in the air. While others might not have known, Ethan wasn’t blind. A simple investigation would reveal the Blackwoods had orchestrated the leaked video.

Nathan Blackwood opened his mouth to respond—but Evelyn cut in first.

"It was me," she admitted, lifting her chin. "Violet Carter and I are friends. Besides… someone had to expose the truth before things got worse."

The Blackwood family stood firmly behind Evelyn. If Mason dared to cause trouble, they were prepared to cut all ties with him without hesitation. Their stubbornness knew no bounds.

Nathan found himself stealing glances at Evelyn, who stood protectively in front of him as if ready to shield him from any harm. The way she braced herself to bear any burden for him made a smirk tug at the corners of his lips.

Most of Mason’s interactions with Nathan had been strictly business. This was the first time he had witnessed this softer side of the usually unshakable man. Noticing the faint imprint of lipstick on Nathan’s cheek, a flicker of envy flashed in Mason’s eyes. Now he understood.

His initial question had been genuine curiosity. In elite circles, who would be so tactless as to expose something so blatantly? Most would feign ignorance to avoid offense, casually sacrificing the interests of someone insignificant.

Yet the Blackwoods were making things unnecessarily complicated—truly an eccentric family. Still, doing business with people like them meant one could always sleep soundly at night.

Seeing Evelyn’s slight tension, Mason chuckled. "Justice Upholder, you really are something."

Huh? Was that sarcasm? But his expression didn’t seem mocking.

After exchanging a firm handshake with Nathan, Mason excused himself to attend to other guests.

As the family stepped outside, they spotted Nathan’s group of friends. Daniel appeared to be deep in discussion about wedding plans, casually waiting for Nathan’s input.

Before they could join them, a sharp slap echoed across the lawn.

Before anyone could react, the Blackwoods heard Evelyn’s excited inner monologue:

Perfect! I thought I’d miss seeing him grovel. Oh wait—he’s already been reduced to ashes, hasn’t he?

The earlier chaos had been overwhelming, and at some point, Violet had vanished.

Now, she stood frozen, having just been intercepted by Mason.

The force of her slap had left his face stinging—an unprecedented humiliation for the rebellious young heir. Stunned, Mason turned to her, disbelief coloring his voice.

"You hit me?"

Violet flicked her wrist dismissively, her tone icy. "You deserved it."

Her attitude toward him had shifted so drastically that Mason could barely process it. Was this the same woman who had once tiptoed around him, her heart brimming with hope for his affection?

The sight of her turning away ignited a spark of fury. He had always held the upper hand in their relationship. Yet when she moved to leave, panic surged through him, and he reached out, his voice uncharacteristically pleading.

"Wait—"

Is this what they call taking things for granted? How utterly pathetic.

Violet Carter stood frozen in place, her expression unreadable. The Blackwood family watched with thinly veiled contempt as Mason Hunter groveled before her. Even Grayson Hart, a man known for his composure, couldn't hide his disgust.

Yet, Mason seemed genuinely terrified of losing Violet. So much so that he didn’t care about the humiliation of being watched by acquaintances.

He blocked her path, desperation lacing his voice. "You can't seriously be ending things like this."

Violet scoffed.

"No, listen—you love me. You must know that. I love you too. I want to marry you. Everything before... it was my fault. I was just scared—scared that if I admitted my feelings, I’d get hurt again. I know I messed up. But you can’t blame me entirely, can you? You spoiled me. You made me think I could do anything and you’d never leave. You can’t just walk away now that I’ve gotten used to it. Let me make it up to you—for those two years of lies. Violet, I love you. Please... give me another chance." Tears streamed down his face.

Ugh. His lines were so cliché. Was he seriously playing the victim now? "I misbehaved because you were too good to me?" What kind of twisted logic was that? With all his sobbing, though, would Violet actually waver?

If not for Evelyn Sinclair’s biting commentary, the Blackwood family might have actually pitied Mason’s dramatic confession. But with her sharp remarks, they found the whole scene more amusing than tragic.

The real question was—how would Violet react?

She stood there, lost in thought, her expression unreadable.

Mistaking her silence for hesitation, Mason pressed on. "As for her... that’s all in the past. It was just pride, nothing more. I haven’t had feelings for her in ages. She’s my sister-in-law—there’s no way anything could happen between us. It was all one-sided."

Wow. What a piece of work. His words were so manipulative. "Getting upset means you still care?" Sure, he hadn’t acted on anything, but the emotional games? The lingering glances at the reunion? Please.

"Let’s start over. If you say yes, I’ll convince my family to arrange our engagement right away. I lo—" He reached for her hand.

Violet sidestepped him. When she finally met his gaze, all he saw was cold indifference.

"I’ll send you the bill later."

Mason blinked. "What?"

The onlookers, who had been enjoying the spectacle, froze. It took them a second to process what had just happened.

Oh, this was going to be good.

The air between them crackled with tension as Evelyn Sinclair crossed her arms, her emerald eyes flashing with resolve. Across from her, Nathan Blackwood stood frozen, his usual composed demeanor shattered by her words.

"For the past two years," Evelyn began, her voice steady but edged with steel, "every cent I've spent on you, every transaction made—I've kept records of it all." She reached into her purse and pulled out a sleek tablet, her fingers flying across the screen. "I'm sending you the breakdown now. Consider it an invoice."

Nathan's jaw tightened as his phone buzzed in his pocket. He didn’t need to check it to know the number would be staggering. Evelyn had never been one to spare expenses when it came to him—luxury suits, five-star dinners, even that absurdly overpriced watch he’d casually mentioned liking once.

"You can't be serious," he said, his voice low.

"Deadly serious," she countered, tilting her chin up. "I want every penny returned. And you have exactly three days to do it."

A beat of silence stretched between them. Nathan’s mind raced—liquidating assets, calling in favors—but the sum would still leave a dent.

Evelyn watched the calculations flicker behind his stormy gaze and allowed herself a small, satisfied smile. This wasn’t just about the money. It was about making him feel the weight of what he’d taken for granted.

"Three days, Nathan," she repeated softly, turning on her heel. "Don’t make me come after you."

The click of her heels against the marble floor echoed like a countdown.

And for the first time in his life, Nathan Blackwood felt the cold grip of debt closing around him.

###Chapter 220 You're The One In Charge

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the glittering ballroom, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with the scent of expensive perfume and hushed murmurs, a symphony of secrets waiting to be uncovered.

Nathan Blackwood stood across the room, his piercing gaze locked onto her as if she were the only woman in the world. The way his tailored suit clung to his broad shoulders sent an involuntary shiver down her spine. Damn him.

Victoria Hayes, ever the serpent in silk, slithered up beside her with a saccharine smile. "Evelyn, darling, you look... interesting tonight."

Evelyn forced a laugh, her fingers tightening around her champagne flute. "Victoria, always a pleasure. Though I must say, your choice of accessories is... bold." She flicked a glance at the gaudy emerald necklace hanging around Victoria’s throat—a gift, no doubt, from some desperate admirer.

Victoria’s smile faltered for a split second before she recovered. "Oh, this old thing? Just a little trinket from an old friend."

Evelyn’s mind raced. Old friend? More like another poor soul she’s wrapped around her finger.

Before she could retort, Serena Whitmore materialized at her side, her agent’s sharp eyes scanning the room like a hawk. "We have a problem," she murmured under her breath.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What now?"

Serena discreetly nodded toward the balcony, where Marcus Donovan—Christopher’s ever-scheming agent—was deep in conversation with none other than Vincent Holloway, the notorious playboy with a reputation for leaving broken hearts in his wake.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. What are those two plotting?

Nathan chose that moment to close the distance between them, his presence radiating dominance. "Enjoying the party?" His voice was smooth, but there was an edge to it—one that told her he knew exactly what she was thinking.

She tilted her chin up. "Immensely. Though I can’t help but wonder why certain people seem so... cozy all of a sudden."

Nathan’s lips curved into a smirk. "Jealous?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Hardly."

But as she glanced back at the balcony, she caught Vincent slipping something into Marcus’s pocket—a flash of white that could only be an envelope.

Her stomach twisted. This isn’t just gossip. This is trouble.

And if there was one thing Evelyn Sinclair knew how to handle, it was trouble.

Her words struck like a bolt of lightning from a clear sky.

.

For over two years, aside from that single instance when she had borrowed money, Violet Carter had never asked Mason Hunter for a single cent.

At this moment, Mason stood utterly speechless.

Well done! That’s exactly how it should be!

While the others remained bewildered, Evelyn Sinclair was silently cheering. In her eyes, Violet had always been hopelessly devoted—who would’ve thought that once awakened, she’d suddenly know how to stand her ground?

"Y-You're demanding money from me?" Mason stammered, visibly shaken.

Hey, watch your wording, alright? She’s not demanding—she’s reclaiming what’s rightfully hers!

"Why shouldn’t I? You’re the one who swindled it from me in the first place. Morally and legally, I have every right to take it back. I’m not trying to exploit you or covet your wealth, but don’t think for a second you can keep taking advantage of me. I won’t accept a penny more than what’s mine," Violet stated calmly.

Ugh, why not ask for more? Emotional damages, at least! You deserve it!

Evelyn was practically vibrating with excitement. Amused, Nathan Blackwood gently patted her back, silently urging her to settle down. Unconsciously, Evelyn had grown so accustomed to his touch that she didn’t even register the gesture anymore.

Nathan understood Violet’s approach perfectly. She wasn’t demanding excessive compensation—just what she was owed. It was her way of reclaiming the dignity she’d sacrificed in that hollow relationship.

Naturally, Mason’s expression soured. Thanks to Claire Morgan’s warped influence on his perception of love, he’d convinced himself that a girl willing to spend money on him must truly adore him. He’d basked in her sacrifices—only for her to now demand repayment, as if erasing every trace of affection she’d ever shown him.

"All of that is trivial. I can give you so much more. My entire fortune could be yours if we just go back to how things were. You wouldn’t have to slave away as a makeup artist—you could stay home as my wife. I’d cherish you, love you, take care of you. I—"

"Mason, even now, you’re still looking down on me from your pedestal." Violet’s voice was sharp with realization. "I remember now. All those years I struggled as a makeup assistant, complaining about bad clients—not once did you use your connections to help me. So many people around you knew the truth. Was it really so hard to throw me a bone? To make my life a little easier? You wanted to test me, but all you did was watch me suffer while enjoying the benefits. You never once considered lifting a finger to help. Hah. Mason, you lied. You never loved me. Not even a little."

The realization hit her abruptly, like a minor detail suddenly thrown into glaring focus.

And with it came a wave of crushing disappointment.

For the past two years, Violet Carter had been nothing but the butt of jokes.

Testing someone's love by pretending to be poor was never right. But if Mason Hunter had truly cared, he could have used his influence to arrange small miracles for Violet whenever she struggled. That would have proven his love—a simple case of learning from past mistakes.

Given Violet’s romantic heart, even after everything, if she had discovered Mason had secretly helped her, she might have forgiven him with a sincere apology.

But Mason did nothing. He let life batter her down, even becoming one of the obstacles himself. Was that love?

Or was it just his own twisted way of punishing her?

No excuses could justify his so-called "test."

Mason seemed to realize it too, his face paling as he stared at Violet.

With a cold smirk, she said, "So all those sweet promises—spoiling me, loving me, taking care of me, telling me to quit my job and just be your wife—were nothing but charity from someone with power. I don’t need your pity. Those bills weren’t small to me. All I want now is to settle everything and never see you again. Don’t come looking for me."

It was as if she had ripped open his deepest thoughts—ones he hadn’t even admitted to himself. Mason’s expression went blank.

Holy hell. The hopeless romantic has finally woken up. Violet, you’re the queen.

"Ms. Carter, don’t worry." Ethan Carter’s voice cut through the tension. He had  dealing with other guests and now approached them. "If my idiot brother doesn’t return your money, I’ll reimburse you myself."

He gave Violet an apologetic nod. "I’m sorry. Whether it’s my brother or my wife, they’ve both caused you pain. Our family will make it right."

Violet opened her mouth to protest, but Ethan continued smoothly. "You want to cut ties with Mason, right? It’s only fair you’d want all debts settled. The Hamptons don’t owe anyone, and I’ll make sure he never bothers you again. You have my word."

At this point, Violet had nothing left to say.

"Mason—" The man in question snapped out of his daze, desperate to salvage things. He didn’t want his brother ruining his last chance.

But before he could speak, Ethan backhanded him across the face. The force sent Mason stumbling back, landing hard on the grass.

Well, that settles it. I’m satisfied.

The Quirk family members nearly burst into laughter in the middle of the tense moment.

Some things never change. Mason was always destined for that slap.

Mason Hunter froze, his expression twisting with indignation. "Ethan, I swear I never laid a finger on your wife! I had no clue about the secrets she kept—I didn’t—"

He wanted to add that he had never betrayed his older brother, not once.

But Ethan Carter’s jaw clenched so tightly it looked painful. "Then why stay silent? From the very beginning… why didn’t you say a damn thing?"

Mason faltered. Truthfully, he didn’t have an answer. Back when Claire Morgan had chosen Ethan with such finality, Mason had wanted to see if she could truly sever her heart from her past. He had waited, watching, wondering if being with Ethan would bring her happiness—or regret.

He had wanted her to regret it. So he had said nothing.

Now, realization crashed over him like a wave. His silence had shattered more than just Claire’s facade—it had torn through Ethan’s family like a storm.

All he could do was bow his head, murmuring apologies.

Yet his gaze flickered toward Violet Carter, stubborn reluctance burning in his eyes. He wasn’t ready to let go.

Ethan’s outburst seemed more like an exhausted release of pent-up frustration than genuine anger.

With the tension thick enough to choke on, the guests quickly dispersed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair eagerly offered Violet a ride home.

Inside the car, Genevieve Blackwood—the one closest to Violet—couldn’t hold back. "Violet, you should’ve demanded triple the compensation from Mason. Letting that bastard off so easily? Unacceptable. He deserves worse."

"Absolutely," Evelyn agreed. "The money you wasted on him could’ve earned interest in the bank. What a colossal waste."

Violet, still reserved around the Blackwood family, hesitated. "Mr. Ethan said he’d handle—"

"They framed you. Ruined your reputation. The compensation Ethan’s giving you is separate from what that scumbag owes you," Evelyn cut in sharply.

Their fierce defense made Violet laugh despite herself. "Interest? Please. I’ll just consider it payment for dating a ridiculously handsome man. Honestly, I got the better deal."

The moment the words left her mouth, she stiffened. The elders were right there. Heat flooded her cheeks. Nerves had made her reckless.

Truthfully, she just couldn’t admit how much time, money, and heart she’d wasted on him.

Evelyn patted her shoulder approvingly. "Good mindset. When you first fell for him—a man with zero redeeming qualities—it was his looks that hooked you, wasn’t it?"

Violet winced but nodded. Mason’s face was unfairly perfect.

Yet when everyone remembered how swollen Mason’s cheeks had been when they left, they couldn’t help but—

Violet couldn't help but burst into laughter, shaking her head in disbelief.

"Let's pray this is truly the end of it," she mused, recalling Mason's shameless, never-ending tantrums before he finally stormed off. It had felt like the drama would drag on forever.

"It will end," Evelyn stated firmly.

Violet merely smiled, assuming Evelyn was just trying to comfort her. She had no idea that Evelyn wasn’t offering empty reassurance—she was stating a cold, inevitable fact.

Because it had to end.

Ethan was about to start cleaning house.

Mason? Claire?

None of them would escape what was coming.

And as for the rest...

Well.

Let’s just say the Blackwood family was watching closely, intrigued by how Ethan intended to handle the situation.

Meanwhile, back at the Hampton estate, Ethan refrained from laying another hand on Mason.

But Liam Bennett?

Oh, he had no such reservations.

A cane in hand, he made sure Mason understood the consequences of his actions.

Only after Liam had vented his fury, and Grace had cried herself hoarse, did Ethan finally reveal his decision regarding Claire and Mason’s fates.

###Chapter 221 The Mark of Vengeance

The morning sun filtered through the curtains of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across her polished mahogany desk. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, the delicate porcelain cup warming her fingertips, as she scrolled through the latest entertainment headlines on her tablet.

A smirk curled her lips as she stumbled upon a particularly juicy piece of gossip—Seraphina Delacroix Spotted Canoodling with Sebastian Hart at Midnight! The article was accompanied by grainy photos of the second-tier actress locked in a passionate embrace with her notorious ex, Maverick Sutton’s former manager, Isabelle Laurent, nowhere in sight.

Evelyn’s mind buzzed with amusement. Oh, Seraphina, you never learn.

Just then, her assistant, Lillian Graves, hurried into the room, clutching a stack of freshly printed scripts. "Ms. Sinclair, Preston Whitmore’s team just sent over the final revisions for your next project. They’re insisting on a table read by Friday."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Tell Donovan Sharpe if he wants me to consider it, he’ll have to push it to next week. I have a charity gala to attend tonight, and I refuse to be rushed."

Lillian nodded, but her gaze flickered to the tablet screen before she could stop herself. Evelyn caught the glance and arched a brow. "Something caught your eye?"

Lillian hesitated, then leaned in conspiratorially. "You’ve seen the Seraphina scandal, haven’t you? Rumor has it Isabelle is furious. She’s already pulled Sebastian from three upcoming projects."

Evelyn’s smirk deepened. "Isabelle always did have a temper. But honestly, Sebastian should’ve known better than to sneak around with Seraphina. That woman leaves a trail of broken hearts—and contracts—wherever she goes."

Lillian giggled, then quickly schooled her expression. "Should I draft a statement in case the press asks for your comment?"

Evelyn set down her tea with a soft clink. "No need. Let them speculate. Besides, I have my own drama to focus on."

Her phone buzzed—a text from Nathan Blackwood.

Dinner tonight? I’ll pick you up at eight.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened, but she schooled her features into indifference. As if I don’t have plans. Still, she typed back:

Only if you’re prepared to explain why you were seen having lunch with Vanessa Sterling yesterday.

She hit send, then leaned back, savoring the anticipation. Nathan’s reply would be telling.

Across the city, in his sleek downtown office, Nathan stared at his phone, his jaw tightening. Damn it. He hadn’t expected Evelyn to find out about that meeting so soon.

Victoria Hayes, his ever-watchful secretary, cleared her throat. "Problem, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan pocketed his phone with a forced smile. "Nothing I can’t handle."

But as he turned back to his paperwork, his mind raced. How much does Evelyn actually know?

And more importantly—what was she planning to do with that information?

The Morgan household was in chaos. Luna had always been the golden child, doted on by her parents, and now they were furious that Claire had manipulated their naive daughter. They demanded answers from Arthur and Violet.

Meanwhile, Claire’s parents were seething, their anger barely contained.

"If it weren’t for your foolish daughter, none of this would have happened!" Violet snapped.

"That’s rich, coming from you!" Arthur shot back. "Your daughter is the one who played Mason, married Ethan while carrying another man’s child, and made a mockery of our family. No wonder her husband’s family threw her out!"

The argument escalated so violently that other relatives had to intervene before fists started flying.

Just then, the phone rang. To everyone’s shock, it was Ethan’s assistant on the line.

Arthur’s face paled as the cold, professional voice delivered the message:

"On behalf of Mr. Ethan Carter, I am formally notifying Ms. Claire Morgan. Divorce proceedings begin tomorrow. She will leave with nothing. If she fails to appear or causes any further trouble, we will pursue legal action for damages. Consider this carefully."

The line went dead before Arthur could respond.

Before he could even process the blow, his personal phone buzzed—a call from his company.

"Mr. Morris, we have a crisis. Hampton Group just backed out of our contract. Xaven Project has frozen all collaboration. Even our suppliers are pulling out. Word is, Hampton Group has blacklisted anyone who works with us. Our entire supply chain is collapsing. What the hell is happening? Are they trying to bury us?"

Arthur felt the walls closing in. The Morris empire was crumbling in real time. His vision blurred, and then—darkness. He collapsed.

News of Ethan’s ruthless retaliation spread like wildfire. No one had expected him to move so swiftly, so mercilessly. Claire, still reeling from humiliation, was dragged from her hiding place and forced to her knees, begging for forgiveness.

But Ethan was unreachable. When she tried calling Liam or Grace, she was met with venomous insults. Desperate, she turned on her own family, screaming accusations until the Morris residence became a spectacle—ambulances and police cars arriving in quick succession.

Meanwhile, Ethan stood over Mason’s unconscious form, his expression ice-cold. He turned to Liam and Grace.

"Have him sent abroad tonight. Permanently. Unless it’s life or death, he doesn’t step foot back here."

Though guilt gnawed at them for their eldest son, their hearts ached for their second. Exiling Mason felt like losing him all over again.

But Ethan’s mind was already elsewhere. Justice had been served.

And he wasn’t done yet.

"Um..."

"Do you really want the entire world to remember our family's disgrace when Mason shows his face in public?"

Silence fell between them.

To prevent any reckless behavior, his assets would be frozen immediately. He would receive only a basic monthly allowance, and I expect neither of you to secretly fund him."

"Isn't this too extreme? Mason has never lived a day without luxury."

"Does living modestly mean suffering? It's not that bad. Didn't he claim money ruined his relationship? Let him see if he can survive on love alone. I'm giving him the chance to prove himself."

Ethan was convinced Mason was a fool. Did he really think women were drawn to him for his personality and not his wealth?

"Mom, Dad," he said firmly. "His stupidity could have destroyed our family. This punishment is justified."

Had Mason spoken up sooner, they would never have allowed Ethan to marry Claire, avoiding this entire scandal.

Seeing his parents' reluctant acceptance, Ethan exhaled in relief. He wasn't completely heartless. "But don't worry," he added. "If he ever redeems himself and makes people forget his mistakes, I'll allow him back."

Liam and Grace knew better than to argue. They could only watch, stunned, as their still-unconscious son was whisked away to another country before dawn.

When Mason finally woke, he found himself powerless—unable to chase after Violet, unable to return home. All he could do was seethe with regret.

Of course, Violet had no idea she'd never have to face that hypocrite again. All she'd receive from now on were repayments and legal settlements.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood family had likely heard Ethan's ruthless resolution through Evelyn's thoughts.

It was satisfying, yes—but there was also unease as they glanced at Nathan.

Though Mason and Claire were despicable, one had been Nathan's close friend, the other a longtime acquaintance. To see them fall so low...

Nathan's brows knitted briefly before he sighed, his gaze steady.

In the end, karma had played its part.

Wait... What is that on Nathan's cheek?

Evelyn's inner voice suddenly cut through the tension. After learning of Ethan's plans, she couldn't help but worry—would Nathan ever grovel over that leaked video in the future?

When Evelyn dared a furtive glance toward Nathan, the dim interior lighting revealed something peculiar on his usually immaculate cheek—a faint smudge that stood out against his fair skin.

The others couldn't help but notice Evelyn's sudden shift in demeanor.

Julian, seated closest to Nathan, couldn't contain his curiosity. "Nathan," he blurted out, "is that... lipstick on your face?"

The words tumbled out before he could stop himself. The sheer absurdity of the idea—his notoriously reserved brother sporting a lipstick mark—made his brain short-circuit. If it was true, then...

Oh no. Evelyn's stomach dropped. Did I really just kiss him? I was so distracted by the video earlier that I didn’t even realize— Her face burned. Julian, you and your sharp eyes! And your even sharper mouth!

Though she gritted her teeth in mortification, the damage was done.

All eyes locked onto Nathan’s cheek, even Violet Carter, the outsider in the car, blinked in stunned silence.

The Blackwoods collectively thought: They kissed?! Right in front of us?! How did we miss that?!

Violet tilted her head. Now that I think about it… I did see Ms. Sinclair suddenly throw her arms around Mr. Blackwood earlier. But why…? She frowned, lost in thought.

Nathan responded to Julian’s question with deliberate ambiguity, but his chest swelled with quiet satisfaction. His gaze flickered toward Evelyn, only to find her suddenly engrossed in her phone, pretending she hadn’t heard a thing.

The Blackwood siblings internally combusted, though none dared voice their thoughts aloud.

Ever the considerate one, Julian fished out a wet wipe from the car’s compartment.

After all, it wouldn’t do for a CEO to parade around with a lipstick stain on his face. The mental image of Nathan walking through Hampton Manor, oblivious to the mark while dozens of guests stared, was enough to make them cringe on his behalf.

But Nathan merely shot them a frosty glare, making no move to take the wipe.

Just then, his phone buzzed violently in his hand.

Richard thought: Have you lost your mind?

Margaret added: No wonder you're still single.

Sophia mused: Should he even wipe it off?

Genevieve chimed in: This is a milestone in their relationship!

Julian rolled his eyes. Might as well get it tattooed on his face at this point.
###Chapter 222 Joining The Gossip Group Chat

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, casting delicate patterns of light across the marble floors. Evelyn Sinclair stood near the towering windows, her emerald-green gown flowing like liquid silk around her. She clutched her champagne flute, her fingers trembling slightly.

Nathan Blackwood watched her from across the room, his dark eyes unreadable. He had been avoiding her all evening, and the tension between them was palpable.

Victoria Hayes, his sharp-tongued secretary, sidled up to him with a smirk. "You should go talk to her," she murmured, her voice laced with amusement. "She looks like she’s about to bolt."

Nathan exhaled sharply but didn’t move. "She knows why I’m angry."

Victoria rolled her eyes. "Oh, please. You’re being dramatic. It was one little misunderstanding."

"It wasn’t little," he gritted out.

Evelyn felt the weight of his gaze and turned, their eyes locking. A jolt of electricity shot through her. She swallowed hard, then made a decision.

Setting her glass down, she strode toward him, her heels clicking against the floor. The crowd seemed to part for her, whispers following in her wake.

Nathan tensed as she stopped before him. "Evelyn—"

"I’m not apologizing," she cut in, lifting her chin. "Because I didn’t do anything wrong."

His jaw tightened. "You lied to me."

"No, I withheld information. There’s a difference."

Victoria snorted. "Oh, this is rich."

Nathan shot her a glare before refocusing on Evelyn. "You knew Serena was planning to leave the agency. You knew, and you didn’t tell me."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Because it wasn’t my place. It was her decision, not mine."

The air between them crackled. Then, abruptly, Nathan grabbed her wrist and pulled her toward the terrace. The cool night air hit them as the doors swung shut behind them, muffling the sounds of the party.

"Let go of me," Evelyn hissed, trying to wrench free.

Nathan released her but didn’t step back. "You keep secrets from me. That’s the problem."

"And you don’t?" she shot back. "What about your little arrangement with Vanessa Sterling?"

His expression darkened. "That’s business."

"Right. Business." She scoffed. "Just like how Harrison Montgomery’s business nearly ruined Natalie’s life?"

Nathan’s patience snapped. "This isn’t about them. This is about us."

Evelyn faltered. The raw emotion in his voice caught her off guard.

Before she could respond, the doors burst open. Marcus Donovan, Julian’s agent, rushed out, his face pale. "Nathan—you need to see this."

Nathan frowned. "What is it?"

Marcus hesitated, then held out his phone. The screen displayed a breaking news headline:

"Scandal Erupts: Sophia Blackwood’s Husband Caught in Affair—Photos Leaked."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Nathan snatched the phone, his grip tightening as he scanned the article.

Then, his gaze lifted—icy and furious.

"This," he said slowly, "changes everything."

As the heated discussion continued, Nathan Blackwood silently observed Evelyn Sinclair with a whirlwind of thoughts clouding his mind.

Watching her act so evasively, he initially assumed she might be feeling shy, embarrassed, or even remorseful. But before long, he caught the faintest sigh of regret slipping past her lips.

Ah, my instincts really failed me back there. Why did I just hug him and kiss his cheek in the heat of the moment? Why didn’t I seize the opportunity to press my lips against his? Under those circumstances, I wouldn’t even have to take responsibility! Ugh, why am I so timid?

Nathan’s reaction was delayed by a fraction of a second before his face burned crimson.

Inside the dimly lit car, the extent of his blush was nearly indiscernible. Yet, his lowered lashes fluttered incessantly, and his lips—soft, tempting—pursed slightly, making him look utterly irresistible.

If you want to kiss me, you can do it anytime. No strings attached. And no, it’s not terrible at all.

The Blackwood family exchanged knowing glances. Go on, Evelyn! Be bold! Do whatever you want—we won’t hold you back!

Their excitement was palpable, fingers practically burning through their phone screens as they silently cheered her on. Then, abruptly, they felt the weight of a gaze—Nathan’s.

He seemed… displeased.

The Blackwoods immediately understood. Oh, right. We messed up. Why did we even share a car with them just to gossip? We’re totally in the way now.

Violet Carter, the unfortunate third wheel, blinked in confusion. Why does the air feel so charged when the car is dead silent?

Of course, leaving now was impossible—the moment had already passed. Evelyn had already moved on, her attention shifting elsewhere.

She had been on the phone earlier, and now she turned to Violet with a warm smile. "Violet, I spoke with Isabelle. Our studio is looking for a long-term makeup artist. If you're interested, you can contact her to sign a contract."

Violet, who had been drained of energy moments ago, suddenly brightened. Sure, Ethan Carter might offer generous compensation, but what truly thrilled her was the chance to advance her career.

Genuinely moved, she expressed her gratitude.

Soon, Violet reached her destination. Stepping out of the car, she watched as it drove away, a strong premonition settling over her. That video… it had to be Evelyn’s doing.

Her mind wandered back to the stolen kiss on the cheek, and she couldn’t help but recall Evelyn’s infamous title—Justice.

In truth, Violet Carter wasn’t the only one with such thoughts. Many guests who had left the Hampton estate that evening were buzzing with speculation.

By nightfall, the scandalous gossip about the Hampton family had spread like wildfire through elite circles, igniting imaginations everywhere.

High society thrived on parties, but nothing fueled conversation like juicy drama.

After all, the last time something this explosive had happened was during the Blackwood family’s grand reception, when the Cowell twins’ shocking revelation had sent shockwaves through the upper crust.

Though this was a Hampton-hosted event, the Blackwoods’ presence—combined with Evelyn Sinclair’s recent upheaval in the entertainment industry—felt far too coincidental.

What truly raised eyebrows was the fact that the incriminating video, the one that had blown the scandal wide open, still hadn’t been traced back to its source.

Of course, whispers of suspicion lingered in the air.

When the elite gossip trickled onto the internet, it didn’t trend like celebrity news, but it still sparked a frenzy among netizens.

Journalists who had attended the wine tasting event dared not report the full story, but leaked party photos only fueled the public’s appetite for clues.

Among the online sleuths, a significant portion belonged to Evelyn’s devoted fanbase.

Netizen: Wait… did I just spot Evelyn in the background?
Netizen: Is she actually there?
Netizen: I always suspected she had high-society ties.
Netizen: Who knows? But where there’s drama, Evelyn’s never far behind!
Netizen: Hah! Is the "Justice Bringer" now moonlighting as the "Gossip Queen"?

Some had predicted this outcome, though at the time, it had been dismissed as mere rumor.

The next day, Evelyn scrolled through the internet, baffled by the sudden spotlight on her name.

At least Violet Carter’s name remained untouched—small mercies meant no disruptions to daily life.

Isabelle Laurent had already reached out, and Violet had come by to finalize the contract.

That afternoon, as the family accompanied Theodore to his competition, Evelyn received a new update.

PIL: After Ethan Carter’s warning, Claire Morgan finally caved. Bandaged and broken, she filed for divorce, sobbing as she begged Ethan to take her back. But he didn’t even glance her way. Sigh. Claire, you knew the risks. If only you’d kept quiet, your secrets would’ve stayed buried.

The Blackwood family couldn't help but sigh—yesterday had been nothing short of a battlefield.

Nathan, currently at work, had also received word about the explosive fallout between the Morris and Hampton families.

Their university group chat had erupted into chaos, but Mason remained silent, and Claire had left the chat entirely. Suddenly remembering something, Nathan spoke up in the chat before adding Evelyn into the conversation.

By now, everyone’s perception of Evelyn had shifted dramatically, and their responses to her were brimming with enthusiasm.

Evelyn was instantly intrigued. She turned to Nathan in a private message: Why on earth did you suddenly add me to your group?

Nathan replied: It’s a goldmine of gossip here. Though he never participated in—or even enjoyed—such discussions, he knew this group thrived on them whenever they gathered.

Evelyn had half-expected him to say something about her needing to connect with his friends as his wife. But his response made her lips curve into an involuntary smile, warmth flooding her chest.

Then, with barely contained excitement, she dove into the chat to enjoy the drama.

Clearly, the group had already spent hours dissecting Mason and Claire’s messy situation. Now, they’d moved on to the topic of Daniel’s upcoming wedding.

Grayson texted: Daniel, I’m dying to know—how did your family finally agree to you marrying her?

Marcus chimed in: Had to be the baby.

Daniel didn’t deny it. Truth is, my father gave his blessing a while ago. It was my mother who held out. This time, Amelia’s pregnancy changed her mind. Not that I care—I’d have married her regardless. But Amelia… she’s always been cautious. She wanted their approval first. Even after getting pregnant, she panicked a few times, debating whether to keep it. I failed her—I didn’t make her feel secure enough.

The group’s reactions ranged from teasing to admiration, all agreeing the two would be happy together.

Evelyn had already pieced together their love story from Daniel’s perspective—a genuine redemption arc.

High school sweethearts. He, the fiercely protective leader; she, the orphaned girl who’d endured relentless bullying.

Now, years later, they were finally getting their happy ending.

Evelyn couldn’t help but smile. Some love stories were worth the wait.

The Blackwood family couldn't help but sigh—yesterday had been quite the battlefield.

At work, Nathan received the explosive news about the complete fallout between the Morgan and Morris families.

Their university group chat was buzzing with activity, but Mason remained silent, and Claire had already left the chat. Suddenly remembering something, Nathan spoke up in the group, then added Evelyn into the conversation.

Everyone’s perception of Evelyn had shifted dramatically, so their responses were overwhelmingly warm.

Evelyn, intrigued, immediately messaged Nathan privately: Why on earth did you add me to your group out of the blue?

Nathan replied: It’s a gossip hub. Though he never participated in the chatter himself, he knew this group thrived on drama whenever they gathered.

Evelyn had half-expected him to say something about her needing to bond with his friends as his wife. But his blunt honesty made her lips curl into a smile, warmth blooming in her chest.

Then, with barely contained excitement, she dove into the conversation.

By now, the group had already exhausted their discussions about Mason and Claire’s messy breakup. Shifting gears, they turned their attention to Daniel’s upcoming wedding.

Grayson texted: Daniel, how the hell did your parents agree to this?

Marcus chimed in: Had to be the baby.

Daniel didn’t deny it. Truth is, my father gave his approval a while ago. It was my mother who refused to budge. Amelia’s pregnancy finally changed her mind. But honestly? I’m just glad I can marry the woman I love with my family’s blessing.

Julian teased: You should’ve knocked her up sooner. Would’ve saved you years of drama.

Daniel sighed. I never listened to them about my career—why would I need their permission to marry? The real issue was Amelia. She’s always been cautious. She wanted their approval before saying yes. Even after the pregnancy, she panicked a few times, debating whether to keep the baby. It’s my fault for not making her feel secure enough.

The group erupted—some laughing at him, others praising his self-awareness. Either way, they agreed he and Amelia would make a happy couple.

Evelyn had already pieced together their love story from Daniel’s perspective. It was a classic redemption arc.

High school sweethearts. He was the bold, justice-driven leader; she was the quiet girl who’d lost her parents and endured relentless bullying.

Now, years later, their story was finally getting its happy ending.

And Evelyn? She was more than ready to enjoy the show.

Daniel Wright had always been Evelyn Sinclair's knight in shining armor. Time and again, he'd swooped in to rescue her, even throwing himself into brutal fights on her behalf—some so vicious they'd landed him in the hospital.

During one of Evelyn's gossip sessions with Nathan Blackwood, she'd learned that Daniel's childhood dream had been to join the Air Force.

The Wright family had deep military roots, so Daniel's future was always destined for either the battlefield or the boardroom. But a violent high school brawl left him with scars—both physical and emotional—shattering his dreams of becoming a pilot.

Proud and stubborn, he refused to settle for any other military role. The corporate world didn’t suit him either—too cold, too calculating. So, he chose the police force instead. Over time, he grew to love the job, and the sting of his lost dream faded.

But that brutal fight had bound them together. Through shared pain and whispered confessions, their hearts aligned, and they began dating.

Even when universities pulled them apart, their love endured. Years of long-distance struggles had finally led them here—to the brink of their happily ever after.

Through the flurry of messages in the group chat, Evelyn discovered the girl's name was Amelia Bennett. Sympathy twisted in her chest. Amelia had been through enough; digging into her past felt cruel. So Evelyn resisted the urge to pry.

Meanwhile, in Daniel and Amelia's cozy apartment, Amelia—ever the doting partner—carried a bowl of freshly cut fruit toward him. The moment he spotted her, Daniel dropped his phone and rushed to her side.

"Amelia, I told you—let me handle this," he chided gently, guiding her to the couch. His fingers brushed over the gentle swell of her stomach, his touch featherlight.

Amelia's eyes shimmered with something fragile, something that made Daniel's chest ache.

"Were you talking to your friends?" she asked softly. "About the wine tasting?"

Daniel sighed. "I didn’t mention it earlier because you were resting. But honestly..."

He hesitated before confiding in her about Mason Hunter and Claire Morgan's messy situation. Then, thinking of Amelia's pregnancy, his voice turned bitter.

"Claire is heartless. How could she just—well, not exactly—but people are saying she might’ve planned to pin the baby on Mason all along. What kind of woman does that?"

The words barely left his lips before Amelia's face drained of color.

"Amelia?" Daniel's concern spiked. "What's wrong?"

"I—I just feel a little sick again," she whispered, pressing a hand to her stomach.

Daniel immediately dropped the subject, too worried to notice the shadow of unease flickering behind her eyes.

In the days that followed, Amelia's "illness" kept her bedridden, leaving Daniel to handle the wedding preparations alone. Between venue visits and guest lists, he was too busy to notice the way Amelia flinched at sudden noises—or how often she checked her phone when she thought he wasn’t looking.

But on their wedding day...


Margaret's perfectly manicured fingers tightened around her champagne flute as her gaze landed on an unexpected guest. "Well, well," she murmured under her breath, "if it isn't Sophia Reed gracing Roland's wedding. Since when did the Nox family rub elbows with the Fords?"

The grand ballroom of the Reed estate glittered with crystal chandeliers and the elite of high society. Margaret adjusted her emerald-green satin gown, her sharp eyes tracking Sophia's movements through the crowd. The younger woman moved with practiced grace in her blush-pink Valentino, laughing at something Daniel Wright whispered in her ear.

"Interesting," Margaret commented to no one in particular, watching how Sophia's hand lingered on Daniel's arm a second too long. The former fiancé of Amelia Bennett certainly seemed cozy with his new companion.

Nearby, Lila Carter nearly choked on her canapé. "You didn't know?" she whispered conspiratorially, leaning closer. "Rumor has it Mason Wright pulled strings to get her an invitation. Something about business connections between their families."

Margaret's perfectly arched brow lifted. "Business connections? Or personal ones?" Her gaze flickered to where Mason stood near the groom, his expression unreadable as he watched Sophia across the room.

The string quartet transitioned into a waltz as waiters circulated with trays of Dom Pérignon. Margaret tapped her designer clutch thoughtfully. "This wedding just got infinitely more fascinating."

Lila smirked, pulling out her phone. "Shall I add you to our little group chat? We've been discussing this exact... situation all morning."

Margaret's crimson lips curved into a smile as she accepted the invitation. Some weddings were about love. Others? Pure entertainment. And this one promised to be the social event of the season.
###Chapter 223 I Do Not Fancy Plastic Surgery

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't suppress the smirk tugging at her lips as she leaned against the plush velvet chaise in Nathan Blackwood’s penthouse. The afternoon sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. But it wasn’t the opulence of the room that held her attention—it was the unfiltered, scandalous thoughts racing through Nathan’s mind.

"She has no idea how badly I want to—"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her champagne flute, her pulse quickening. Ever since the bizarre incident at the gala—when she’d somehow gained the ability to hear Nathan’s innermost musings—she’d been drowning in a sea of his unspoken desires, frustrations, and, most deliciously, his secrets.

Nathan stood by the bar, his tailored suit hugging his broad shoulders as he poured himself a drink. His expression was the picture of cool indifference, but his thoughts? Oh, they were anything but.

"If she keeps looking at me like that, I’ll cancel every meeting this week."

Evelyn bit her lower lip, feigning interest in her phone while mentally cataloging every sinful implication behind his words. The man was a walking contradiction—outwardly composed, inwardly feral.

Then came the real gem.

"Victoria thinks she’s so clever, blackmailing me with those photos. But she doesn’t know I’ve already—"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Photos? Blackmail?

Before she could delve deeper into that tantalizing tidbit, Nathan’s voice cut through the silence.

"You’re unusually quiet today," he remarked, his tone deceptively light.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Just enjoying the view."

His gaze darkened, and his next thought slammed into her like a physical touch.

"She’s playing with fire."

Oh, she was. And she had every intention of fanning the flames.

The Blackwood and Reed families had always been close, so they arrived at the wedding as one grand procession. The women entered arm in arm, their elegance turning heads, while the men followed closely behind, exuding quiet authority. The entire family was breathtakingly striking—so much so that the moment they stepped out of their luxury cars, they became the center of attention.

And why wouldn’t they be? Blackwood Enterprises had just closed a groundbreaking deal, one that left competitors seething with envy yet grudgingly impressed.

Rumors had been swirling that the youngest Blackwood heir might soon leave the entertainment industry to study abroad—a strategic move, no doubt. Some speculated it was Nathan Blackwood’s way of consolidating power within the family, ensuring his siblings shared the weight of their empire while carving their own legacies. The Blackwoods were nothing if not ambitious, and their internal dynamics were notoriously complex.

Naturally, many guests saw this as an opportunity to gather intel, hoping to align themselves advantageously for the future.

After exchanging pleasantries with acquaintances, the Blackwoods made their way toward the Reed estate when an unexpected figure caught their attention.

Curious, Genevieve turned to Margaret. "Who is that?"

Margaret, recalling that the younger generation had never met Sophia Reed, replied smoothly, "That’s Claudia Bennett’s discarded daughter."

Sophia occasionally visited her grandparents, and since the Harrisons were on good terms with Margaret’s family, they had crossed paths before.

Still, it was odd to see her here. Neither the Noxes nor the Harrisons had any known ties to the Reed family.

Evelyn followed Margaret’s gaze, her eyes landing on the striking woman.

Wow. A stunner.

The entire Blackwood family discreetly assessed Sophia. She was undeniably beautiful—thankfully, she hadn’t inherited her mother’s sharp, calculating features.

Sophia was the epitome of an ice queen—her face naturally composed, her expressions minimal. Everything about her screamed unattainable, as if she existed on a plane far above mere mortals.

When she turned and spotted Richard and Margaret, she approached with effortless grace, her manners impeccable.

It was only then that everyone noticed the man beside her.

He didn’t quite match her refined aura. Dressed casually, he carried himself with a roguish charm, though his expensive watch and confident stance betrayed his wealth.

As they neared, his gaze swept over the Blackwoods—assessing, calculating. It wasn’t outright rude, but it left an uneasy prickle along the skin.

"Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood," Sophia greeted with a slight nod. "It’s been a while. How have you been?"

Her voice was cool, polished, yet devoid of warmth.

And just like that, the tension in the air thickened.

"Sophia, you're attending Daniel's wedding too?" Margaret greeted with an amused smile, her designer gown shimmering under the chandelier lights.

"I came with Mason," Sophia Reed replied, adjusting the strap of her Valentino clutch. Having recently returned from Paris where her family had relocated their business headquarters, she'd grown distant from domestic social circles. The invitation had come through Mason's connection to the Reed family.

Margaret's eyes twinkled with mischief. "My, how you've grown! When we last met, your grandmother was still lamenting about your single status."

A rare blush crept up Sophia's cheeks, contrasting sharply with her usual cool demeanor.

"Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood," Mason Wright interjected smoothly, his arm possessively around Sophia's waist. "I consider myself the luckiest man to have won Sophia's heart just three months ago." His smile revealed perfectly aligned teeth that seemed almost too white.

As Margaret performed introductions, Evelyn Sinclair found herself studying Mason's features with growing unease. There was something... off about his chiseled jawline and symmetrical features.

Nathan Blackwood waited until they were out of earshot before murmuring, "That Mason fellow has more silicone in his face than a Beverly Hills surgeon's office. I'd pay good money to see his original mug."

Genevieve gasped. "Really? How can you tell?"

"Observe the lack of natural expression lines," Julian Blackwood pointed out, swirling his champagne. "That frozen forehead hasn't moved since we arrived. Textbook overdone fillers."

Sophia Blackwood nodded in agreement. "Now that you mention it, his smile doesn't reach his eyes."

Evelyn finally understood her discomfort. "Modern men and their vanity. Nathan's natural features are far more appealing." She absentmindedly traced the strong line of her husband's jaw.

Nathan, who'd been mentally cataloguing where he'd heard Mason's name before, suddenly perked up at the unexpected compliment. Before he could stop himself, he sidled closer to Evelyn like an overeager golden retriever, their arms brushing.

Interpreting the contact as a social cue, Evelyn automatically linked her arm through his. Nathan's entire body went rigid, his breath catching at the unexpected intimacy. The sudden tension in his posture didn't escape the Blackwood family's notice.

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Honestly, brother. You'd think she'd never touched you before." The family's muffled laughter followed them into the grand ballroom, where crystal glasses clinked and an orchestra played.

Unseen by the guests, Mason's surgically enhanced smile slipped as he watched the Blackwoods enter. His grip tightened imperceptibly on Sophia's hand, his eyes darkening with something far removed from wedding joy. Across the room, a waiter with familiar features subtly nodded in Mason's direction, the silent communication lost in the celebration's bustle.

The Blackwood family had grown accustomed to such trivial developments. Unless it involved something as dramatic as an embrace or a kiss, they barely batted an eyelash.

The manor was bustling with guests as they arrived.

This time, not only were elders like Richard and Margaret present, but friends of Sophia, Genevieve, and Julian had also gathered. As soon as they stepped inside, the group dispersed.

Since there was no juicy gossip to catch up on that day, the Blackwoods hadn’t bothered to arrive early. By the time they made their entrance, Nathan’s circle of friends was already there.

Nathan arrived with Evelyn in tow, joining the lively group where they spotted Daniel as well. It was rare to see him dressed so formally—his hair perfectly styled, his tailored suit accentuating his striking features. They seemed to be discussing the upcoming bridal procession.

On Amelia’s side, there were no relatives left, so they had designated the apartment she shared with Daniel as her bridal home. Surrounded by colleagues and classmates, she waited to be fetched.

"Perfect timing, Nathan, Evelyn! Care to join us?" Daniel beamed, his excitement palpable. "Let’s go fetch the bride!"

The others were already laughing and chatting animatedly. Even Beatrice, who usually despised such gatherings, had risen to her feet.

In the past, Nathan would have avoided such boisterous affairs. But this time, he found himself intrigued, eager to experience something new. Still, he glanced at Evelyn for her approval.

Naturally, Evelyn was all in for the fun and nodded enthusiastically.

And so, they set off with the groom to retrieve the bride.

As they rode in the car, Vivian suddenly piped up, curiosity lacing her tone. "Grayson, why didn’t you bring anyone with you today?"

Ah, right—where was Gwendolyn?

"Hmph, that naive girl is throwing a tantrum," Grayson grumbled. All he’d done was watch her overseas performance video in front of Gwendolyn. Was her reaction really necessary? Threatening to cut ties over something so trivial—he assumed she was just playing hard to get.

Seriously? Couldn’t it be that Gwendolyn’s contract had ended and she simply chose not to renew it? She’d made enough money, after all. The sheer joy of quitting a job she despised was something Grayson couldn’t possibly fathom.

Evelyn bit back a laugh as she watched Grayson’s smug arrogance. She couldn’t wait to see his reaction when he realized Gwendolyn wasn’t coming back.

###Chapter 224 Illegitimate Children

The grand ballroom of the Blackwood estate shimmered under the glow of crystal chandeliers, the air thick with the scent of roses and whispered secrets. Evelyn Sinclair stood near the balcony doors, her emerald-green gown catching the light as she sipped champagne, her gaze scanning the crowd.

Nathan Blackwood, ever the enigmatic figure, leaned against a marble pillar, his dark eyes locked onto Evelyn. The tension between them was palpable, a silent battle of wills that had the guests murmuring behind their fans.

Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, slithered through the crowd, her crimson lips curled in a smirk. She had a dossier tucked under her arm—one that could unravel everything.

Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-loyal agent, intercepted Victoria with a polite but icy smile. "Looking for someone, Ms. Hayes?"

Victoria’s smirk faltered. "Just delivering some urgent documents to Mr. Blackwood."

Serena’s eyes narrowed. "How diligent of you."

Across the room, Sophia Blackwood—Nathan’s sister—whispered to her husband, Daniel Prescott. "Did you hear? There’s talk of an illegitimate heir."

Daniel’s grip tightened on his glass. "Whose?"

Sophia’s gaze flicked toward Nathan. "Who else?"

Meanwhile, Julian Blackwood, Nathan’s reckless younger brother, was already three drinks in, flirting shamelessly with a starlet. His agent, Marcus Donovan, sighed, rubbing his temples. "You’re going to get us both fired."

Julian grinned. "Relax. What’s the worst that could happen?"

As if on cue, the grand doors burst open.

A woman stood there, her presence commanding silence. She was elegant, poised—and holding the hand of a small boy.

The boy had Nathan’s eyes.

Gasps rippled through the room.

Evelyn’s champagne flute slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor.

Nathan’s expression darkened.

Victoria’s smirk returned, triumphant.

And just like that—the game changed.

The tension in the penthouse was thick enough to cut with a knife. Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers gripping the edge of the marble countertop until her knuckles turned white. Outside, the city lights glittered like scattered diamonds, but she barely registered their beauty.

Nathan Blackwood’s voice cut through the silence like a blade. "You knew, didn’t you?"

Evelyn didn’t turn around. She couldn’t. Not when the weight of his accusation pressed against her chest like a leaden weight.

"Knew what?" she asked, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her.

"Don’t play dumb, Evelyn." Nathan’s footsteps echoed as he closed the distance between them. "Victoria Hayes told me everything."

At the mention of Victoria’s name, Evelyn’s breath hitched. That woman had been a thorn in her side since day one, always lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Evelyn finally turned, meeting Nathan’s piercing gaze. His stormy gray eyes were darker than she’d ever seen them, filled with a mix of betrayal and something else—something that made her heart clench.

"Victoria has been manipulating you," Evelyn said, her voice low but firm. "She’s been feeding you lies to drive us apart."

Nathan scoffed, running a hand through his already disheveled hair. "Funny how every time I hear the word 'lie,' it’s coming from your mouth."

Evelyn flinched. That stung more than she cared to admit.

Before she could respond, Nathan’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening. "I have to go."

"Where?" Evelyn demanded, stepping forward.

"Does it matter?" Nathan shot back, his tone icy. "You clearly have your own agenda."

Evelyn’s hands balled into fists at her sides. "Nathan, listen to me—"

But he was already striding toward the door, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

Just as he reached the threshold, Evelyn blurted out, "If you walk out that door, don’t bother coming back."

Nathan paused, his back still turned. For a heartbeat, Evelyn thought he might turn around—might give her a chance to explain.

But then he let out a bitter laugh. "Maybe that’s for the best."

The door slammed shut behind him, the sound reverberating through the penthouse like a gunshot.

Evelyn stood frozen, the weight of his words crashing over her. She had fought so hard to keep their relationship intact, but in the end, it had all unraveled in a matter of minutes.

Her phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. It was a message from Lillian Graves, her assistant.

"Evelyn, we have a problem. The press just got wind of Nathan’s meeting with Victoria. It’s all over the news."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. This wasn’t just a personal disaster—it was a professional one. If the media twisted this into a scandal, it could ruin everything she’d worked for.

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to think. She couldn’t fall apart now. Not when so much was at stake.

But as she stared at the closed door, one thought echoed in her mind:

What if it’s already too late?

The incident with Grayson had been nothing more than a minor setback. Soon enough, they arrived at the luxurious penthouse. After a series of playful bridal games—some involving blindfolded challenges, others requiring Nathan to prove his devotion—Evelyn finally made it into the bridal suite, surrounded by a lively crowd.

The space was packed, bodies pressed together, making it impossible for her to see the ongoing game at the center. She rose onto her tiptoes, straining for a better view—only to be suddenly swept off her feet in one smooth motion.

The gesture was familiar, yet this time, the sensation was entirely different. Nathan’s arms around her felt possessive, secure, as if he never wanted to let go. His grip tightened instinctively, pulling her closer against him, and she could feel the rapid thud of his heartbeat beneath her fingertips.

He was nervous.

Evelyn blinked in surprise, her own pulse quickening. Even suspended in the air like this, she felt inexplicably safe. Around them, children were being lifted onto shoulders for a better view—but she was the only adult in such an undignified position. Heat rushed to her cheeks, and she squirmed slightly, signaling for him to put her down.

But when she glanced down, she noticed something unexpected—Nathan’s ears were burning red.

Had he been blushing this whole time?

A mischievous impulse seized her. Her fingers, already resting against the nape of his neck, twitched—then deliberately pinched the tip of his crimson earlobe.

Nathan jolted as if electrocuted, his head snapping up to stare at her with wide, startled eyes.

Evelyn immediately released him, schooling her expression into one of perfect innocence.

I wasn’t teasing you, she thought, biting back a grin. I just wanted to see if your ears were as warm as they looked. But wow—they’re practically on fire! Is the great Nathan Blackwood actually flustered? Hah! Who knew the ruthless CEO could be this adorable?

Nathan turned his face away sharply, his jaw tight, but the heat radiating from his skin betrayed him.

“Wait—is that Evelyn Sinclair?”

“It is! The Evelyn Sinclair! The A-list actress!”

“And the guy holding her—damn, he’s gorgeous. Even more striking than Julian Blackwood. How does someone like that even exist? And he’s carrying her like she weighs nothing!”

Nathan stiffened, his grip on her tightening almost imperceptibly. He waited, tense, for Evelyn’s reaction. Deep down, he wanted the world to know she was his—but he understood her career came first. If she wasn’t ready to reveal their marriage, he wouldn’t push.

Evelyn smirked to herself.

That’s right. He’s my husband. Handsome, powerful, and utterly devoted. And he’s all mine.

The thought sent a thrill through her.

Nathan Blackwood—blushing, possessive, and hopelessly in love with her.

Who would’ve guessed?

A wave of relief surged through Nathan, leaving him unexpectedly exhilarated.

He could certainly indulge Evelyn's pride.


Yet it was clear the whispering guests understood—since they'd arrived with Daniel, these individuals held considerable status. No one dared risk taking unauthorized photos. After some hushed murmurs, the topic swiftly shifted.

"Who would've guessed? Amelia's fortunes have completely turned. That girl who endured so much misery in high school is now marrying into the Ford dynasty."

"I suspect Daniel pitied her at first, and pity gradually bloomed into love. Men can't resist women who awaken their protective instincts."

"Amelia's docile personality isn't my preference, but she did suffer terribly. Bullied relentlessly, she'd appear at school bruised almost daily. Though now, it seems her stars have finally aligned."

"Honestly, it's been years. With Daniel spoiling her like royalty, I expected her personality to evolve. Yet she remains that same timid mouse from our school days."

"And today—her wedding day! She's been radiating gloom since morning preparations. Only someone as relentlessly cheerful as Daniel could endure her melancholy daily without crumbling."

"Childhood scars do linger, don't they?"

"Not necessarily. Pregnancy hormones could also explain it."

These two were evidently Amelia's former classmates, unable to resist revisiting old gossip.

As Evelyn observed the bride, she noted something distinctly amiss. Despite Daniel's dramatic knee-drop and passionate vows, Amelia's reaction was... unsettling.

Most brides either glowed with joy or brimmed with happy tears.

Amelia, however, fidgeted nervously. Her eyes darted about, her smile strained—as if her mind were miles away.

Utterly perplexing.

Before Evelyn could analyze further, cheers erupted. The bridal games concluded, and Daniel whisked Amelia directly to the Ford estate.

Upon arrival, Daniel refused to let Amelia's feet touch the ground, sweeping her into his arms with theatrical flair. His gaze burned with adoration as he carried her inside.

Well-wishers showered them with congratulations along the way.

"To the happy couple!"

"Thank you."

"Congratulations."

Amidst the sea of well-wishers, two unexpected figures emerged from the crowd.

Nathan Blackwood acknowledged everyone with a gracious smile, but his expression faltered the moment his gaze landed on the two familiar faces—people he had only met once before, yet their presence sent an inexplicable chill down his spine.

At that very moment, the woman in his arms, Amelia Bennett, began trembling uncontrollably.

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice laced with concern as he tightened his hold on her.

She shook her head, burying her face deeper into his chest, as if desperate to hide whatever emotion had taken hold of her.

Assuming she was simply overwhelmed, Nathan quickened his pace, eager to whisk her away to the privacy of their newlywed home.

But Amelia wasn’t just overwhelmed—she was terrified.

Peeking through the crook of his arm, her blurred vision followed the retreating figures until they disappeared into the distance. A single tear slipped free.

He’s here.

Meanwhile, Sophia Reed noticed her boyfriend, Mason Wright, chuckling under his breath.

"What’s so amusing?" she asked, arching a delicate brow.

Mason snapped out of his thoughts and pulled her closer. "Just thinking how much I envy them. I want that for us—soon."

Sophia stiffened. "We’ve barely been together six months. Marriage isn’t even on the table yet."

A flicker of irritation crossed Mason’s face. Always so damn cautious.

Before he could respond, a discreet wave caught his attention. It was the assistant of Victor Reed—Nathan’s father.

Mason’s eyes gleamed with opportunity. "Excuse me for a moment, love," he murmured before slipping away.

The assistant regarded him with thinly veiled disdain. "The boss wants to see you. Follow me."

With a smirk, Mason trailed behind him into the sprawling garden of the estate.

The distant sound of barking dogs led them to a secluded corner where Victor Reed stood, his boutonniere marking him as the groom’s father.

Before Mason could utter a word, Victor’s voice cut through the air like a blade.

"What the hell are you doing here? Who gave you permission to come?"

Mason feigned innocence. "Father, even if Daniel doesn’t know I exist, he’s still my brother. I couldn’t miss his wedding."

Victor’s jaw tightened. "If you’re here to cause trouble—"

"I’m not," Mason interrupted smoothly. "Mother made the consequences very clear. I’m just here to observe."

Victor studied him for a long moment before exhaling sharply. "Keep it that way. If you ruin this day, I swear—"

Mason held up his hands in mock surrender. "Relax. I’m just a guest."

But as he turned away, his smirk returned.

For now.

"Why would I do that, Father? I even brought my girlfriend today so you could meet her. This is Sophia Reed, the young heiress of the Reed family."

"What? You're dating her? How did her family even agree to this? You can't be serious—" Victor Reed replied, stunned.

"Her father never interferes with her choices. She’s free to date anyone, regardless of background—as long as they win her over. Though… given my situation, if we were to marry, they might expect me to take her name and live with them."

Victor’s brows furrowed, his expression darkening with contemplation.

"Fine," he finally said, voice clipped. "Go back to your girlfriend for now. We’ll discuss this later."

Mason Wright smirked, hands tucked casually in his pockets as he turned away.

As he passed a row of neatly trimmed hedges, the sharp bark of a dog cut through the air—then abruptly stopped. Odd.

Unbeknownst to him, hidden behind the foliage were two figures and three massive German Shepherds.

Evelyn Sinclair had heard that Daniel Wright kept retired police dogs. Bored while waiting for the bride’s outfit change, Nathan Blackwood suggested visiting them, knowing she’d adore the animals. And she did—laughing as she scratched behind their ears.

The butler had left them to it, never imagining they’d overhear a bombshell revelation.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Evelyn, one hand cradling a dog’s head while the other clamped over its muzzle, gaped.

Oh my God. The Reeds have a skeleton in their closet! Margaret always said Victor and Serena had an arranged marriage but grew to genuinely care for each other. Who knew there was an illegitimate son lurking in the shadows?

Daniel doesn’t know yet. Should we tell him? Not today—it’d ruin the wedding. And Sophia’s boyfriend—Mason, was it? His motives are transparent. He’s using her to force Victor’s hand. Disgusting. We barely know Sophia, but should we warn her?

Before she could decide, Victor’s low voice carried over from the terrace.

"Have someone watch him. Ensure he doesn’t cause trouble."

"You don’t trust Mason, sir?"

"Not entirely. I sent him and his mother abroad after that fight with Daniel—the one that left his face scarred. Knowing his temper, I doubt he’s forgiven it. Today is not the day for scandals."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Wait—they knew each other? And his face was scarred? What the hell happened?

Nathan froze mid-step, his breath catching in his throat. A fight? Facial scars? Ethan?

In an instant, the fragmented memories clicked into place like pieces of a long-forgotten puzzle.

A shadow flickered across Nathan's piercing blue eyes as the realization struck him—Ethan had been the notorious tormentor from his high school years, the boy who'd made his adolescence a living nightmare.

Evelyn gasped, her delicate fingers flying to her lips. "What? No! That can't be..."

The revelation hung thick in the air between them, charged with unspoken implications. Nathan's jaw tightened as he mentally reconstructed the timeline—Ethan's sudden disappearance during their senior year, the whispered rumors about an "accident," and now this damning connection.

Across the room, Lillian Graves nearly dropped her tablet, her eyes widening behind her chic glasses. "Mr. Blackwood, are you saying—"

Nathan cut her off with a sharp gesture, his mind racing through the possibilities. If Ethan was involved, then this changed everything. The carefully constructed facade of their present might crumble under the weight of buried secrets.

Evelyn reached for Nathan's arm, her touch feather-light yet grounding. "We need to look into this," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper yet carrying the weight of conviction.

Nathan met her gaze, seeing his own determination reflected in her emerald eyes. The game had just taken an unexpected turn, and the stakes had never been higher. Somewhere in the shadows, the truth waited—and it was far more dangerous than either of them could imagine.

###Chapter 225 Why Did You Interfere

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake, her body still humming from the intensity of last night. Nathan Blackwood’s arm was draped possessively over her waist, his breathing deep and even. She carefully slipped out from under his hold, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet as she padded toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The city below was just waking up, but Evelyn’s mind was already racing. The gala had been a success—her new film project had garnered attention, and whispers of her undeniable chemistry with Nathan had spread like wildfire. But beneath the glittering surface, tension simmered.

Victoria Hayes had been watching them all night with a gaze sharp enough to cut glass.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around the silk robe she’d thrown on. Victoria wasn’t just Nathan’s secretary—she was a viper waiting to strike. And after last night’s whispered threats, Evelyn knew the woman wouldn’t hesitate to sink her fangs in.

A rustle of sheets drew her attention. Nathan was awake now, his dark eyes tracking her every move. “You’re up early,” he murmured, voice rough with sleep.

“Couldn’t sleep,” she admitted, turning to face him. The morning light caught the angles of his face, highlighting the faint scar along his jaw—a remnant of a past he rarely spoke about.

He sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. “Thinking about Victoria?”

Evelyn arched a brow. “Am I that transparent?”

Nathan smirked, but there was no humor in it. “She’s been with me for years. She knows how to play the game.”

“And what game is that?” Evelyn challenged, stepping closer.

His expression darkened. “Power. Control. She thinks she can manipulate me.” His hand shot out, catching her wrist and pulling her onto the bed. “But she doesn’t know you.”

Evelyn’s pulse spiked as his lips brushed her ear. “And what do I do?”

Nathan’s grip tightened. “You fight back.”

A knock at the door shattered the moment.

“Mr. Blackwood,” Victoria’s crisp voice called through the wood. “Your nine o’clock is here.”

Nathan’s jaw clenched, but he released Evelyn with a reluctant sigh. “Duty calls.”

Evelyn watched him dress with practiced efficiency, her mind already plotting. If Victoria wanted a war, she’d get one.

Because Evelyn Sinclair didn’t just fight back—she won.

The members of the Blackwood family, scattered across the lavish venue, abruptly halted their conversations mid-sentence.

What had they just overheard?

Though they stood at a distance, catching only fragments of the heated exchange—what in the world had just been revealed?

Sophia Reed's boyfriend—the man they had just seen—was actually Victor Reed's illegitimate son?

Richard and Margaret happened to be facing Serena Collins at that very moment.

With a practiced laugh, Serena engaged Margaret in light conversation, her expression the picture of oblivious innocence—a performance so convincing it bordered on pitiable. After all, in the polished circles of high society, both Richard and Victor had always been regarded as honorable men, the kind who didn’t dally with mistresses or sire secret children.

Yet here was the truth: Victor’s illegitimate son was nearly the same age as Daniel Wright. The revelation was nothing short of earth-shattering.

Sophia Blackwood and Genevieve happened to catch sight of Genevieve guiding the newlywed bride down the grand staircase, her face radiant with joy, as if she hadn’t a single worry in the world.

Meanwhile, Julian Blackwood stood outside and spotted Mason Wright strolling back leisurely, his demeanor relaxed.

No wonder he looks so different. Did he get reconstructive surgery after Daniel disfigured him?

But Daniel didn’t even know this man was his father’s secret son—so why would he attack him?

Besides, knowing Daniel’s temperament, he would never act so impulsively, even if he did discover the truth. After all, the illegitimate child wasn’t to blame for his own existence. Daniel had always been surprisingly compassionate in such matters.

Then, without warning, Evelyn Sinclair’s piercing scream tore through the air, sharp and unmistakable.

Every Blackwood in attendance tensed.

What now?

What secret could possibly be more shocking than an illegitimate child—enough to make her scream like that?

Evelyn: "It can’t be. This is absolutely impossible!"

The Blackwoods: "What? What exactly is impossible!?"

Evelyn: "Daniel’s wife is pregnant… with Mason’s child!"

The Blackwoods stood frozen, utterly dumbfounded.

Wait a minute.

What did she just say?

Whose wife—and whose child?!

Standing beside Evelyn, Nathan was equally stunned, his gaze lingering on her with undisguised shock.

The woman was too absorbed in the scandalous revelation to notice his reaction.

Evelyn: It was Mason who bullied Amelia in high school, and Daniel saved her! So how could Amelia possibly...

The Blackwoods: Was she threatened? Coerced? Poor girl. That must have been hell.

Nathan: That doesn’t make sense. Daniel’s status far surpassed Mason’s. Amelia could’ve crushed him if she’d spoken up. Daniel had all the power to end it.

Evelyn: Blackmail! Mason must’ve had leverage. That’s the only explanation...

Evelyn had always seen Amelia as fragile, timid. The idea of her willingly carrying Mason’s child was unfathomable. A nagging suspicion crept in—was there something she didn’t know?

She combed through the details again.

Evelyn: No coercion. No blackmail. No... Ugh.

Silence.

The Blackwoods leaned in, hungry for more, only to be left hanging.

What the hell happened?!

The suspense is torture!

Then—Evelyn’s sharp inhale.

Evelyn: Daniel, you’re the unluckiest man alive!

The Blackwoods’ pulses spiked.

Evelyn: Why did you interfere? She wanted it!

Reality crashed over them, shattering every assumption.

Could it be... Amelia enjoyed the abuse?

Is this some kind of twisted kink?

Evelyn: Back then, Amelia was new to school when she "accidentally" spilled water on Mason. The moment he noticed her—ratty clothes, quiet demeanor, no parents to defend her—his cruelty spiraled. The bullying escalated fast. Slaps. Kicks. Daily torment.

Evelyn: At first, she complained to teachers. But the more Mason got scolded, the worse he retaliated. Soon, classmates avoided her out of fear. They chose self-preservation over compassion.

The Blackwood family sat in stunned silence as Evelyn recounted the twisted tale. It was a classic case of every man for himself—until Daniel Wright, then a first-year senior, stumbled upon Grayson Hart tormenting Amelia Bennett with a group of younger girls. Daniel, righteous to a fault, intervened without hesitation. He escorted Amelia to the infirmary, tended to her wounds, and demanded answers. When he learned the truth, he stormed to the principal’s office, refusing to let the matter drop. Eventually, Grayson was summoned with his parents.

The Blackwoods exchanged bewildered glances. Wasn’t this supposed to be a straightforward hero-saves-the-damsel scenario?

Yet, even if Amelia didn’t fall for her rescuer, how could she possibly develop feelings for her tormentor?

Evelyn continued, her voice measured. At the time, Amelia feared and resented Grayson, but she was deeply grateful to Daniel. After the school handled the incident, she accidentally witnessed Grayson speaking with Victor Reed on campus. She only knew Victor as Grayson’s father—not Daniel’s. Victor berated Grayson harshly, even striking him. "Remember your place as an illegitimate child," he hissed. "One more misstep, and I’ll have you sent away!" When Grayson tried to call him 'Father,' Victor silenced him with a glare.

The Blackwoods frowned. And? How does this explain Amelia’s feelings?

Evelyn’s lips thinned. After Victor left, Grayson broke down in the rain. To Amelia, he looked like a lost child. Something in her stirred—pity, perhaps—and she stepped forward, shielding him with her umbrella. At first, Grayson reacted with hostility, even raising a hand to strike her. But she didn’t flinch. She just stared at him, silent and sorrowful. Then, he shattered. He pulled her into a desperate embrace, sobbing against her shoulder. In a moment of raw emotion, he kissed her. She resisted at first, but then… she stopped. And just like that, Grayson carved a place for himself in her heart.

Nathan Blackwood pinched the bridge of his nose. This reads like some angsty teen drama. Fine, so they had a moment. But how did Daniel get dragged into this mess?

Evelyn sighed. After their encounter, Grayson was mortified. He wanted to erase it from existence—especially since he’d never thought much of Amelia to begin with. Amelia wasn’t the type to demand commitment, so outwardly, nothing changed. But Grayson had a rebellious streak. He craved Victor’s approval and resented Daniel for having it. Since Daniel protected Amelia, Grayson targeted her even more fiercely.

Yet, Evelyn added, Daniel was dealing with his own struggles. He assumed the earlier incident had been enough to deter Grayson. And Amelia… she couldn’t bear the thought of Grayson being expelled. So she endured his cruelty in silence, hiding it from Daniel.

But once Grayson noticed Daniel’s attention waning, he lost interest in Amelia and started pursuing women who caught Daniel’s eye. Amelia, feeling abandoned, grew anxious. She began confiding in Daniel, her distress bleeding into their interactions. It didn’t take long for him to realize something was wrong.

The room fell silent.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. So let me get this straight. Amelia pitied Grayson, endured his abuse to protect him, and then… fell for him?

Evelyn’s gaze darkened. Love isn’t logical. Sometimes, the heart clings to the very thing that breaks it.

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred beneath silk sheets. Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand—another message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

"Evelyn, the meeting with Preston Whitmore has been moved to 11 AM. Also, Nathan Blackwood’s office called—again."

Evelyn groaned, rubbing her temples. Nathan had been relentless since their last encounter, his messages growing increasingly urgent. She knew what he wanted—answers she wasn’t ready to give.

Downstairs, the penthouse hummed with quiet activity. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted from the kitchen, where her housekeeper, Claudia Bennett, was already preparing breakfast.

"Good morning, Miss Sinclair," Claudia greeted warmly. "I made your favorite—avocado toast with poached eggs."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thank you, Claudia."

Her phone buzzed once more. This time, it wasn’t Lillian.

"We need to talk. Today."

Nathan’s name flashed on the screen, sending an unwelcome jolt through her. She exhaled sharply, fingers hovering over the keyboard.

Before she could reply, another notification popped up—a breaking news alert.

"A-List Actor Harrison Montgomery Spotted with Mystery Woman Amidst Divorce Rumors."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Harrison—her former co-star and Natalie Whitaker’s soon-to-be ex-husband—was making headlines again. The accompanying photo showed him leaving a high-end hotel with Vanessa Sterling, his longtime mistress.

"Poor Natalie," Evelyn thought, though she knew the woman was far from helpless. Natalie had her own secrets—ones that could ruin Harrison if she chose to reveal them.

The doorbell chimed, pulling Evelyn from her thoughts.

Claudia hurried to answer it, returning moments later with a familiar face—Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s sharp-witted agent.

"Darling, you look like you’ve seen a ghost," Serena remarked, eyeing Evelyn’s tense posture.

"Close enough," Evelyn muttered, tossing her phone onto the couch. "Nathan won’t stop calling."

Serena arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "And you’re avoiding him because…?"

Evelyn hesitated. The truth was complicated—wrapped in layers of past betrayals and unspoken promises.

Before she could answer, her phone rang again.

This time, it wasn’t Nathan.

It was Marcus Donovan—Julian Blackwood’s agent.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Julian was Nathan’s brother, and if he was calling…

Something was wrong.

She swiped to answer. "Marcus?"

His voice was clipped, urgent. "Evelyn, you need to get to the Blackwood estate. Now."

A chill ran down her spine. "Why? What happened?"

Marcus exhaled sharply. "It’s Sophia. She’s been in an accident."

The world tilted. Sophia—Nathan’s sister, her closest friend.

Evelyn was already grabbing her coat, her mind racing. "I’m on my way."

As she bolted toward the door, Serena called after her, "Evelyn, wait—what about your meeting with Preston?"

But Evelyn didn’t stop.

Some things were more important than business.

And right now, Sophia—and Nathan—needed her.

The Blackwoods: Huh? What... What does this mean?

They had initially pitied Amelia for her twisted affection toward the man who tormented her. But what they just heard left them utterly speechless.

Evelyn: Amelia assumed Daniel would merely warn Ethan. But every time Daniel caught him, he reported him to the school, demanding his expulsion. Each time, Amelia intervened, begging Daniel not to go through with it. When questioned, she would only shake her head, tears welling in her eyes—so heartbroken that anyone who saw her would ache in sympathy.

Evelyn: Daniel believed she was too traumatized to risk further retaliation. Though he vowed to protect her, she kept pleading for Ethan’s mercy. Little did Daniel know, she was protecting the man she secretly adored. Fearing his actions would distress her further, Daniel reluctantly relented and guarded her even more fiercely. Over time, his pity twisted into love.

Evelyn: Naturally, Ethan noticed. He saw the way she looked at him—no hatred, only something unsettlingly close to devotion. No matter how cruelly he treated her, she never truly fought back. A little force, and she yielded. Often, she didn’t even protest.

Evelyn: Ethan’s malice deepened when he realized Daniel loved Amelia. He locked her in a storage room, intent on violating her. She fought desperately, so he bound her. As he recorded her sobs, Daniel burst in. Seeing Amelia like that shattered him. In the ensuing struggle, Ethan’s face was permanently disfigured. Daniel, too, bore scars from that night.

The Blackwoods exhaled sharply.

Nathan’s expression darkened. He remembered Daniel’s childhood dreams—the spark in his eyes when he spoke of flying. Nathan had envied that passion; emotions never came easily to him. But now, Daniel’s dreams were ashes—all because of Ethan and Amelia.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. The truth was staggering.

Evelyn: The scandal exploded. Everyone expected Amelia to testify against Ethan, but she refused. They assumed she wanted to bury the shame, so they dropped it. Still, Ethan was expelled. Furious, his father smuggled him abroad for reconstructive surgery, where he stayed to study.

Evelyn: During Daniel’s hospitalization, Amelia visited daily. There, she learned his injuries had destroyed his chance at the Air Force—years of preparation, gone. She wept endlessly. Daniel’s mother, Serena, was so moved by her devotion...

The weight of sorrow pressed down on her so heavily that she couldn't bring herself to blame Amelia. Daniel, however, was devastated to see her in such distress. He reassured her repeatedly, insisting he was fine, even attempting to comfort her through her tears. The truth was, Amelia herself didn’t know who she was crying for—was it guilt toward Daniel, or the crushing realization that the man she truly loved was lost to her forever?

Evelyn: Perhaps it was out of remorse, or perhaps she was moved by his unwavering devotion, but Amelia eventually agreed to date Daniel. Despite her unconventional views on love, she knew deep down where her happiness truly lay.

The Blackwoods were stunned. This is unbearable! What kind of twisted mess is this? What did Daniel ever do to deserve this? Is Amelia repaying his kindness with betrayal?

And now she was carrying Mason’s child?

Wait—how did they even reconnect? Does Amelia have no morals at all?

Now, they fully grasped the meaning of never judging a book by its cover.

The whispers resumed.

Evelyn: Under Daniel’s gentle care, the wounds in Amelia’s heart slowly began to heal. Though they attended different universities, they shared a sweet and tender college romance. During this time, Amelia met Daniel’s father and discovered the truth about Mason and Daniel’s relationship. Desperate to escape, she nearly ended things with Daniel, but he managed to coax her back.

The Blackwoods: Ugh, why did he even bother? This is infuriating!

Evelyn: Because Amelia couldn’t bear to let go of such a good man, and she truly believed she could bury her misguided past. But everything shattered when Mason reappeared.

Evelyn: He returned with one goal—to take everything that belonged to Daniel. At first, Amelia resisted, wanting to flee, but Mason’s familiar dominance pulled her back in. On the very day they reunited, he dragged her into a hotel room, and… well, you can guess the rest. It was only then that Mason realized it had been her first time, and the thought filled him with dark satisfaction. Honestly, I feel sick just recounting this.

The Blackwoods: We’re nauseated too!

Evelyn: The encounter left Amelia broken, yet she still yearned for Mason and considered leaving Daniel. But Mason treated her like dirt, refusing to take responsibility. Heartbroken, Amelia walked away—yet she still didn’t break things off with Daniel.

Evelyn: It wasn’t long before Mason came crawling back. Amelia initially resisted, but the moment he whispered "I love you," she caved. Their secret affair continued behind Daniel’s back until Amelia became pregnant. When she demanded Mason choose, he was thrilled—not because he wanted her, but because he saw an opportunity. He insisted she marry Daniel and keep the child. That way, even if he couldn’t inherit the Reed fortune, his child could. Disgustingly cunning, isn’t he?

The Blackwoods were speechless. They had clung to the faint hope that Amelia might still have some shred of decency.

But after today’s wedding, they realized how laughably naive they’d been.

Evelyn: At first, Amelia hesitated. She still had a conscience, after all. Daniel was her savior, the man who had changed her life. She knew she had already betrayed him unforgivably. But Mason refused to claim her or their child. Terrified of raising a baby alone, she chose to betray Daniel completely. She even swore to him that she would build a happy life with him and their child—vowing never to see Mason again.

The Blackwoods: As if that’s believable!

Nathan suddenly recalled how Amelia had frequently skipped their gatherings. Had she really been busy, or…?

Pathetic. Absolutely vile. Mason’s promises were empty, yet Amelia clung to him, always at his beck and call. She dreamed he would sweep her away, only to be crushed each time. She knew he had a girlfriend—he never hid it. He bluntly told her that her status made her unfit to be his wife, that she should be grateful just to bear his child. It nearly destroyed her.

And yet, here she was today—smiling as if nothing was wrong.

By now, the Blackwoods felt physically ill.

Evelyn: I get that both she and Claire are securing substitute fathers for their children, but at least Claire is honest about her motives. Amelia, though…

Evelyn fell silent. For some inexplicable reason, her fury toward Amelia burned hotter than her anger toward Mason.

Her gaze flickered toward Nathan, who stood beside her, his expression stormy. She knew he was still reeling from the revelation that Mason was Victor Reed’s illegitimate son.

But I can’t just stand by.

Daniel was a good man—Nathan’s close friend. She couldn’t let this farce of a marriage continue. It was an insult to him! But how could she intervene? They’d been together for years, and Amelia was pregnant. Without concrete proof, how could she expose the truth?

Just as she wrestled with her thoughts, Nathan abruptly pulled out his phone and made a call.

"You have one hour," he commanded coldly. "Dig up everything on Mason Wright. I want every place he’s been in the last six months—especially any surveillance footage of him meeting someone alone."

Evelyn’s eyes lit up.

Wait—this could work! Nathan probably suspected Mason was plotting against Daniel out of revenge. But an investigation like this would inevitably uncover Amelia’s involvement. Once they had proof, the truth would come crashing down!

#####Chapter 226

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood slept soundly, his dark lashes brushing against his cheekbones. A faint smile curved her lips as she traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips.

Last night had been… unforgettable.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, shattering the peaceful silence. With a reluctant sigh, she reached for it, squinting at the screen.

Victoria Hayes.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. The woman had been a thorn in her side since day one—Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, who made no secret of her disdain.

She hesitated before answering. "Victoria?"

"Good, you're awake." The clipped tone was laced with impatience. "Nathan’s presence is required at Blackwood Industries. Immediately."

Evelyn frowned. "He’s still asleep. Can’t it wait?"

A derisive laugh crackled through the line. "Not unless you want the board to vote him out before noon."

Her breath hitched. What?

Before she could demand an explanation, the call disconnected.

Nathan stirred beside her, his deep voice rough with sleep. "Who was that?"

Evelyn turned to him, her pulse racing. "Victoria. She said the board is moving against you."

His eyes snapped open, all traces of drowsiness vanishing. In one fluid motion, he sat up, raking a hand through his tousled hair. "Damn it."

She gripped his arm. "What’s going on?"

His jaw tightened. "Someone’s been leaking confidential merger details to our competitors. The board thinks it’s me."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "That’s ridiculous!"

Nathan’s phone chimed—a message from Marcus Donovan, his brother Julian’s agent.

» They’ve called an emergency meeting. Get here now.

Nathan swore under his breath, already swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. Evelyn scrambled after him. "I’m coming with you."

He paused, his gaze locking onto hers. "No. It’s too risky."

She crossed her arms. "I’m not letting you walk into that viper’s nest alone."

A flicker of admiration crossed his face before he exhaled sharply. "Fine. But stay close."

As they dressed in tense silence, Evelyn’s mind raced. Who would do this?

Victoria’s smug face flashed in her mind.

Or better question—who stood to gain the most from Nathan’s downfall?

Blackwood Industries – Boardroom

The air was thick with tension as Evelyn followed Nathan inside. Every head turned, eyes narrowing at her presence.

Victoria stood near the head of the table, lips curled in a smirk. "How… domestic of you to bring your little distraction, Nathan."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms, but Nathan didn’t so much as glance at the woman.

"Get to the point," he said coldly.

Edward Cowell, the family patriarch, leaned forward. "We have evidence that sensitive information was leaked from your office, Nathan."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Show me."

A file slid across the table. Evelyn’s breath caught as she glimpsed the documents—emails, transaction records, all damning.

Too damning.

Her gaze flicked to Victoria, who was watching Nathan with barely concealed triumph.

This was a setup.

Evelyn’s fingers twitched toward her own phone. If they wanted proof of sabotage, she knew exactly where to look.

But first—they had to survive the next ten minutes.

Nathan straightened, his voice cutting through the murmurs. "This is fabricated."

Victoria scoffed. "Convenient denial."

Evelyn stepped forward before she could stop herself. "Actually, it’s too perfect. Almost like someone wanted it to look like Nathan’s fault."

The room fell silent.

Victoria’s smirk faltered.

Nathan’s hand brushed against Evelyn’s, a silent thank you.

Then—

» Incoming call: Serena Whitmore

Evelyn’s agent.

Her stomach lurched. Serena never called during business hours unless it was urgent.

She excused herself, stepping into the hallway. "Serena?"

"Evelyn," her agent’s voice was strained. "Turn on the news. Now."

Heart pounding, Evelyn pulled up a live broadcast.

The headline blared across the screen:

» BLACKWOOD HEIR INVOLVED IN CORPORATE ESPIONAGE? LEAKED DOCUMENTS SUGGEST NATHAN BLACKWOOD SOLD COMPANY SECRETS.

Her blood ran cold.

This wasn’t just a boardroom ambush.

This was war.
###Chapter 227 Providing For Someone Else

The truth was, Daniel and Amelia's marriage wasn't legally binding yet—they hadn’t even signed the marriage certificate. Perhaps Amelia was holding onto some lingering hope, which explained why she kept delaying the paperwork and insisted on holding the wedding ceremony first.

That made stopping this wedding all the more crucial.

Curious, Evelyn asked Nathan whether she should relay the recent conversation between Victor and Mason to Daniel.

Nathan advised her to wait for concrete evidence.

Deep down, Evelyn hoped Nathan would uncover something damning about Amelia. If it was just the issue of an illegitimate child, bringing it up on someone’s wedding day would be in poor taste. It was a conversation better suited for after the ceremony. Besides, even if mentioned beforehand, it wouldn’t necessarily derail the wedding.

Nathan shared the same sentiment. He knew that merely revealing the existence of an illegitimate child would only disgust Daniel, not deter him.

Not to mention, the bond between Daniel and Amelia had been forged over years. A few offhand remarks from Nathan wouldn’t be enough to shake his resolve. Solid proof was necessary.

Evelyn and Nathan returned to the ballroom, spotting Mason and Sophia among the crowd. They were politely greeting Victor and Serena, behaving like any well-mannered younger generation would.

Serena didn’t recognize them at all, yet she maintained flawless decorum.

Victor studied Sophia with a gaze brimming with approval.

No matter how Evelyn looked at it, the scene was sickening. Two men deceiving two unsuspecting women—it was nothing short of repulsive.

The scattered members of the Blackwood family had already regrouped, unable to resist discussing the scandalous gossip they’d overheard. Hearing Evelyn’s silent thoughts, they couldn’t help but shoot disdainful glances toward Victor and Mason.

Ugh, watching these two scoundrels communicate through subtle glances is infuriating. Do they really think everyone else is blind?

The Blackwoods had noticed it too—the calculating, meaningful looks exchanged between that father-son pair. It was enough to make one’s blood boil.

I’d heard that, compared to Serena, Victor was more accepting of Daniel marrying Amelia. At first, I couldn’t understand why—usually, patriarchs of influential families push for strategic marriages to secure alliances. But now it makes sense. He already has a backup plan. If Daniel insists on his career as a detective and refuses to inherit the family empire, Victor wouldn’t want his power falling into the hands of his nephews. Naturally, his own son would be the preferred successor. So, Daniel marrying Amelia isn’t a problem for him.

Originally, he planned to use his failing health to guilt-trip his wife’s family into legitimizing his illegitimate son. But now that Mason has found a wealthy girlfriend, he’s already scheming. If Mason really manages to win over Sophia Reed…

The thought alone was enough to make Evelyn’s stomach churn.

Nathan Blackwood intended to accelerate his plans and bring Mason Wright back into the fold.

In truth, the meteoric rise of the Reed family had been heavily supported by the military connections of Serena Collins' family.

Now, the fact that Victor Reed wanted to leave all his achievements to his illegitimate child with his mistress was utterly revolting.

Not to mention, Mason had also devised a cunning scheme that struck from multiple angles.

Margaret had considered informing Serena about the situation, but her family had stopped her. They believed an outsider exposing such a scandal might come across as offensive and unbelievable.

However, things would be different if the revelation came from someone like Nathan, who shared a brotherly bond with Daniel Wright.

After exchanging pleasantries with Victor and Serena alongside Sophia Reed, Mason excused himself to mingle elsewhere.

Margaret, ever soft-hearted, couldn’t help but worry about Sophia. Yet, they weren’t particularly close. How could she possibly interfere in someone else’s romantic affairs?

Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan strolled through the grand hall, their gazes involuntarily trailing after Sophia.

She’s stunning, but what a shame she’s blind when it comes to men.

Since meeting at an elite overseas university, Mason had pursued Sophia relentlessly. Due to her family’s circumstances, the Nox family adored her unconditionally. They never cared about matching social status or wealth—Sophia’s happiness was all that mattered. Thus, they remained indifferent to Mason’s background.

Ah, what a tragedy. Sophia’s first love was Mason. Given her nature, she likely wouldn’t leave him just because of his illegitimate child. The only thing that could shatter their relationship would be discovering his affair with Amelia Bennett.

At that moment, Nathan refused to let himself be distracted by Sophia’s predicament, merely casting a cold glance in Mason’s direction.

Soon, they spotted Daniel among his circle of friends.

The group was still laughing and chatting animatedly. When they noticed Nathan and Evelyn approaching, they teased them, asking if they’d sneaked off for a secret rendezvous.

Evelyn glanced at Nathan. His expression remained as unreadable as ever, so no one suspected a thing.

She admired his composure—she, on the other hand, was practically bursting at the seams. Knowing so many scandalous secrets, she was dying to spill them all.

Unable to resist, Evelyn subtly steered the conversation toward the bride.

"How’s Amelia doing? She looked rather pale earlier."

A flicker of confusion crossed Daniel’s face. "Probably nerves. She barely slept last night. Pregnancy is exhausting, after all."

Indeed, love blinds. When it came to Amelia, Daniel’s judgment was completely clouded.

A detective's sharp instincts were utterly powerless here.

"How far along is she?" Evelyn Sinclair inquired, her curiosity piqued.

 with his drink, Daniel Wright chuckled. "Almost four months now. And let me tell you, this little troublemaker is already giving his mother hell. Just wait till he's born—I'll teach him some manners!"

Oh, Daniel. There were no words.

"Four months?" Nathan Blackwood suddenly interjected, his tone unreadable. "Weren't you away on business for half a year?"

Huh. Nathan had a point. A very good one.

The room fell into stunned silence.

This wasn’t like Nathan at all. He never involved himself in personal matters, let alone voiced something so blunt. The implication hung heavy in the air—was he suggesting Daniel had been played for a fool?

If Grayson Hart had said it, Daniel might have lunged at him. But Nathan’s expression was as indifferent as ever, his interest so rare that Daniel dismissed it as idle curiosity.

With a sheepish grin, Daniel shrugged. "Yeah, I was away when Amelia came to visit. Didn’t expect that to happen, but hey—life’s full of surprises, right?"

His voice softened as he recalled that night. Amelia had shown up unannounced at his doorstep, pale and trembling, clinging to him as if he were her lifeline. "I missed you," she had whispered between tears. His heart had melted instantly.

His friends erupted into teasing laughter.

Nathan remained impassive, but Evelyn’s pulse quickened.

Oh, Daniel. You have no idea, do you?

She traveled all that way just to trick you into claiming another man’s child. And the worst part? You’ve never even touched her. All this time, you’ve been providing for someone else’s lover.

The Blackwood family members, eavesdropping nearby, nearly gasped aloud.

What?!

Nathan stiffened imperceptibly.

Daniel was painfully naive. Years with Amelia, even living together, yet he’d never pushed further. He assumed her reluctance stemmed from past trauma—that incident in the warehouse years ago. So he waited, patient, believing she needed time.

Amelia hadn’t understood her own resistance either—until Ethan came along. After being with him, she developed a twisted sense of loyalty, making Daniel’s touch unbearable. When it came time to register the baby, she got him drunk and staged the whole thing.

And he never suspected a thing.

The Blackwood family stood frozen in shock, their expressions a mixture of disbelief and horror.

I'm genuinely beginning to think Daniel Wright has lost his mind to love's delusion. The man struts around like some conquering hero, convinced he got Amelia Bennett pregnant with such ease. Not once did he pause to question whether he even remembered that supposed night together.

Now that Amelia's carrying a child, she holds all the power. She could reject Daniel without hesitation. If they were to marry, he'd be signing up for a lifetime of raising another man's child and providing for another man's woman—all while his so-called friends continue mocking him with saccharine teasing.

Meanwhile, Nathan Blackwood's phone buzzed incessantly on the marble countertop, notifications flooding in one after another.

###Chapter 228: Mind Games and Juicy Revelations

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her jasmine tea, her fingers absentmindedly tracing the rim of the porcelain cup. A wicked smirk played on her lips—today was going to be deliciously entertaining.

Across the city, Nathan Blackwood adjusted his cufflinks in the mirrored elevator of Blackwood Tower, unaware that his every thought was an open book to the woman he'd been trying to outmaneuver for months.

"Board meeting at nine... Victoria's report better be flawless, or heads will roll. And that deal with Holloway—need to renegotiate the terms before Preston catches wind of it."

Evelyn nearly choked on her tea. Oh, this is too good. Nathan's internal monologue was practically gift-wrapped for her amusement. She leaned back, savoring the mental image of the notoriously unshakable CEO sweating over a spreadsheet.

Then came the real gem.

"Why the hell did Genevieve insist on family dinner tonight? Unless she’s finally dumping Damian—thank God. That man’s more plastic than his credit limit."

Evelyn’s laughter echoed through the penthouse. She’d pay good money to see Nathan’s face if he knew she knew his private disdain for his sister’s boyfriend.

Her phone buzzed—a text from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Lillian: Serena says the Vanity Fair interview’s moved to 3 PM. Also, Harrison Montgomery’s team wants you for his wife’s birthday gala. Drama alert: Vanessa Sterling’s hosting.

Evelyn’s grin turned feline. Natalie Whitaker and Vanessa Sterling under one roof? The claws would be out before the champagne was poured.

She was about to reply when Nathan’s thoughts hijacked her attention again—this time, laced with something far more intriguing than corporate scheming.

"Sinclair’s wearing that red dress in the Vogue spread. Should’ve bought the whole damn magazine just to burn it. Distraction’s a liability."

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered. Oh, Nate. If only you knew how transparent you are.

Downing the last of her tea, she made a decision. Tonight’s family dinner? She’d crash it in that dress. Let him choke on his hypocrisy.

And if Damian happened to "accidentally" spill wine on Nathan’s $10,000 suit? Well, some bonuses came in unexpected packages.

The revelation came faster than expected—partly due to Nathan Blackwood's efficient team, but mostly because Daniel Wright had been living like a ghost since returning home. His days were spent either groveling before his girlfriend's family or sneaking off to luxury hotels with Amelia Bennett.

Such illicit affairs always left the clearest paper trail. When Nathan ordered an investigation, his men knew exactly what to look for. Within hours, every hotel receipt and security footage landed in his inbox.

Hearing Evelyn Sinclair's mental warnings was one thing. Seeing his childhood friend being played for a fool was another. Nathan exhaled sharply, the weight of betrayal pressing against his ribs.

Noticing Nathan's intense focus on his phone, Evelyn leaned closer. Though the videos remained unpaused, the thumbnails told the damning story.

A thrill shot through Evelyn's veins. Perfect. The dominoes are falling exactly as planned. With Nathan's sharp mind, he must've pieced everything together by now.

After pocketing his phone, Nathan turned to Daniel with uncharacteristic gravity. "We need to talk. Privately."

Daniel blinked at Nathan's solemn tone. Though confused, he rose without protest.

The Blackwood family exchanged curious glances, teasing them about secretive behavior.

A direct confrontation? I wonder how Daniel will take it. Not that I should enjoy his misery... but damn, I'd pay to see his reaction. Despite her usual boldness, Evelyn hesitated to intrude.

Nathan surprised her by grasping her wrist. "You're coming too," he declared, pulling her along before she could protest.

The Blackwoods collectively held their breath as the trio disappeared into the study. The sudden silence was deafening—without Evelyn present, her entertaining inner monologue vanished.

Meanwhile, Daniel's frown deepened. Between Nathan's stormy expression and Evelyn's poorly concealed excitement, dread coiled in his stomach. "What's this about?" he demanded.

Nathan unlocked his phone and slid it across the mahogany desk. The screen displayed a hotel surveillance still—Daniel's arm wrapped around Amelia's waist as they entered an elevator. The timestamp read yesterday afternoon, when Daniel had claimed to be at a business lunch.

Evelyn bit her lip, vibrating with barely restrained anticipation. Showtime.

Daniel Wright's face went utterly blank, his stunned gaze fixed on Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair.

"An illegitimate child? Ethan? That high school bully who tormented Amelia? He's my half-brother? And he had the audacity to show up today?"

Evelyn had never heard Daniel's voice so unsteady before. The shock must have hit him like a freight train.

Unfortunately, this was only the beginning.

Daniel's expression darkened, the vein on his forehead pulsing violently as he struggled to rein in his emotions. He trusted Nathan implicitly—there wasn’t a shred of doubt in his mind.

The revelation that his father had betrayed his mother for over two decades was a crushing blow. He wasn’t worried about his own pain—no, what terrified him was the thought of his mother ever finding out.

Daniel shut his eyes briefly, exhaling sharply. "Nathan, Evelyn… I appreciate the honesty. But I need you both to keep this quiet for now. I’ll handle it myself."

Exhausted, he spoke his piece—only for Nathan to cut in, "That’s not even the worst of it."

Daniel froze, staring at Nathan in disbelief. His father’s secret love child wasn’t the main issue? What could possibly be worse?

Evelyn winced. "Brace yourself."

A cold dread seeped into Daniel’s bones.

Nathan pulled out his phone, tapped a few times, and Daniel’s device buzzed as several videos came through.

"I had my suspicions about him," Nathan admitted, voice low. "So I dug deeper. What I found… wasn’t just an affair. If it were just that, I wouldn’t have dropped this bomb on you today."

Daniel frowned. The timing had been odd. The truth about Ethan could’ve waited until after the wedding.

But then he unlocked his phone—and his blood ran cold.

The thumbnails alone made his breath hitch.

He played them, one after another.

His vision blurred red. His entire body trembled, his grip on the phone tightening until the screen cracked under the pressure.

When he finally looked up, his face was pure fury.

He actually—

Evelyn hesitated. Something about Daniel’s reaction felt… off.

"Why didn’t she tell me? Why... the child..." Daniel's voice cracked, his words dissolving into fragments of disbelief.

Nathan frowned slightly, realizing Daniel was too distraught to think clearly. He cut straight to the point. "If you investigate, you’ll likely find discrepancies in how far along she is. Think back—were you even involved with her during that time?"

Daniel staggered as if struck, his entire body trembling. He wasn’t stupid. The truth hit him like a freight train—the child wasn’t his. It belonged to his half-brother, Mason. Amelia had only used him as a cover.

Then, Nathan relayed what he’d pieced together from Evelyn’s earlier observations, framing it with cold logic. "I suspect Mason knows about the pregnancy. This could be his play for the Ford fortune. Even if he doesn’t inherit, his child will."

No man could stomach such betrayal. Daniel’s rage burned white-hot.

Evelyn studied him cautiously before murmuring, "Do you want to call off the wedding?"

It was as if her words snapped him out of a trance. Without warning, Daniel bolted from the room.

His expression was terrifying—unhinged, murderous.

Before Evelyn or Nathan could react, he was already gone.

I thought he’d handle this quietly to save face. But he’s going straight for them? Are the cheating pair about to get exposed in front of everyone?

Excitement flared in Evelyn’s chest. She grabbed Nathan’s arm, dragging him toward the commotion erupting outside.

The scene they stumbled upon was chaos.

From across the hall, they saw Daniel had already knocked Mason to the ground with a single brutal punch.

The impact sent a tooth flying. Blood smeared Mason’s lips as he lay dazed, barely registering the next blow before Daniel hauled him up by the collar and struck again—harder, wilder.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Victor shouted for someone to intervene, but Sophia was faster, throwing herself between them.

Daniel froze mid-swing. No matter how furious, he’d never hit a woman.

"Move!" he snarled.

"Mr. Wright!" Sophia snapped, shielding Mason. "This is your wedding. What possible excuse do you have for this?"

The air crackled with tension.

Evelyn’s pulse raced.

This is about to get so much worse.

Sophia Reed's eyes burned with fury, her fingers curling into fists as she stood protectively in front of Mason Wright, shielding him from Daniel Wright's wrath.

"This has nothing to do with you—move!" Daniel snarled, his voice sharp as a blade.

"You call yourself a cop?" Sophia shot back, refusing to yield an inch. "Since when do officers assault people without reason?"

Around them, guests quickly intervened, pulling Daniel away before the situation escalated further.

Serena Collins steadied her son, her grip firm on his arm. "Daniel, what in the world has gotten into you?"

Victor Reed's gaze darted to Mason, relieved to see he was still conscious despite the blow. Then, his expression darkened as he turned on his son. "Explain yourself! Attacking a guest at your own wedding—have you lost your mind?"

Daniel's jaw clenched, his glare icy. "A guest?" He pointed accusingly at Mason. "You're calling him a guest?"

Before he could continue, a voice called out from the second-floor balcony.

Daniel turned to see Amelia Bennett standing there, her face pale, tears shimmering in her eyes.

From this distance, he couldn’t tell who she was looking at—but the sight of her silenced him. Swallowing his rage, he turned back to his father, his voice low and dangerous. "That man is not welcome here."

"Daniel?" Serena gasped, stunned by her son's behavior.

His teeth ground together. "Mom, you don’t remember, do you? He was the one who made my high school years hell. He tormented Amelia."

Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood, who had followed the commotion, exchanged a glance. Something wasn’t adding up.

Why would Daniel attack Mason publicly instead of handling this discreetly? And if he was going to expose him, why not reveal the full truth—that Amelia had been cheating with Mason? Was it pride? Did he really think he could salvage this wedding by hiding the scandal?

Nathan frowned, just as confused.

The Blackwood family watched the scene unfold, equally baffled. Was Daniel really planning to bury the truth to save face?

Good grief, Evelyn thought, shaking her head. Daniel, you absolute fool.
###Chapter 229: Mind Games and Whispered Secrets

The morning sunlight streamed through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she absentmindedly stirred her coffee. Her phone buzzed with notifications, but her attention was elsewhere—specifically, on the mental monologue of her assistant Lillian Graves, who stood just three feet away arranging files.

"Oh my god, did you see Nathan Blackwood's latest Instagram story? That man could melt glaciers with that smile. And the way he looked at Evelyn during last night's gala—"

Evelyn's spoon clattered against her porcelain cup. She hadn't meant to eavesdrop on Lillian's thoughts again, but this mind-reading curse of hers had other plans.

"Everything alright, Ms. Sinclair?" Lillian asked, her professional demeanor belying the hurricane of gossip swirling in her mind.

"Please don't tell me she heard me thinking about her boyfriend. Wait—are they even official? The tabloids say—"

"Perfectly fine," Evelyn interrupted with forced calm. "Just... remembered I have that meeting with Preston Whitmore at noon."

Lillian nodded, but her mental commentary continued unabated. "That director's such a creep. Always 'accidentally' brushing against actresses. Though I'd kill to know what really happened between him and Seraphina Delacroix last—"

Evelyn stood abruptly. "I need air."

The elevator ride down gave her no reprieve. A delivery man's thoughts about his cheating girlfriend. The doorman's mental calculations of his gambling debts. And then—

"Evelyn looks exhausted. Probably another fight with Nathan. Wonder if it's about that Victoria Hayes woman..."

She spun around to find Marcus Donovan, Julian Blackwood's smarmy agent, smirking at her from the opposite corner of the elevator. His surface thoughts were bad enough, but Evelyn knew the real dirt lay deeper—the kind of secrets that could topple empires.

The doors opened to the lobby. Marcus tipped an imaginary hat. "Lovely weather for scandals, isn't it, Ms. Sinclair?"

As Evelyn stepped into the sunlight, her phone buzzed with a text from Nathan: We need to talk about last night.

Her stomach dropped. Because pulsing beneath that simple message, she could already hear the unspoken thought—the one that had kept her awake until dawn.

She knows.

The Blackwood family couldn’t comprehend why Evelyn would react that way, but from their perspective, it seemed as though she was so exasperated that laughter was her only escape.

Meanwhile, Daniel’s revelation sent shockwaves through the crowd. All eyes turned to Mason, their gazes laced with suspicion and disbelief.

“Seriously? He’s the infamous school bully?”

“But he doesn’t look the part.”

A few of their former high school classmates were present, and memories of Mason’s past behavior resurfaced.

Victor exhaled in relief. He had initially feared Daniel had uncovered something far more damning—only to realize he had merely recognized Mason as the boy he’d once beaten up in high school.

“What nonsense!” Sophia snapped, her voice sharp with indignation. How could her boyfriend possibly be such a vile person? “You must have him confused with someone else.”

“Ms. Reed, your boyfriend’s name is Mason Wright, correct? Has he ever had plastic surgery?”

Sophia stiffened. It was true—Mason had undergone cosmetic procedures. She’d seen his old photos, but he’d claimed it was due to a car accident.

“Back then, he tormented a classmate, and I punched him in the face. After that, he was expelled and fled abroad to get his face fixed,” Daniel said coldly, his glare piercing through Mason. “I’m stunned you’d dare show your face here again.”

Never in his life had Daniel despised someone this much. His fists remained clenched, his body coiled like a predator ready to strike.

By then, Nathan’s friends had also gathered around.

“That’s the bully? Damn, he’s got some nerve showing up here,” Marcus muttered under his breath.

“Even if he is, why attack him now? Daniel’s a cop—this isn’t like him,” Lucas pointed out, frowning.

“Maybe he was worried Amelia would panic if she saw him?” Vivian suggested, though she sounded uncertain.

“Then he should’ve handled it discreetly,” Grayson retorted, exasperated.

Beatrice remained silent, but she, too, thought Daniel had acted rashly.

At that moment, Nathan realized something was off.

Knowing Daniel’s temperament, if he’d discovered Amelia’s affair with Mason, his first instinct would’ve been to confront her for answers. Only after that would violence even cross his mind.

Yet Daniel’s immediate reaction had been pure, unbridled rage—exactly like their last high school fight. Back then, Daniel had found out Mason had trapped Amelia with malicious intent. Enraged, he’d beaten Mason beyond recognition.

Now, history was repeating itself.

Nathan’s thoughts raced as the pieces fell into place.

The Blackwoods, unable to contain their curiosity, closed in around Nathan and Evelyn.

“Nathan, what the hell is Daniel thinking?” Julian blurted out.

Nathan didn’t need to answer—Evelyn’s internal monologue said it all.

Typical. Even the most unfortunate souls have kinder hearts than this. But then again, can you blame Daniel? Amelia’s whole act is ridiculously misleading. In high school, she played the innocent victim while secretly pining for Mason. The surveillance footage we later showed Daniel only reinforced his misconceptions.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. What surveillance footage?

Nathan suddenly recalled the videos—the way Mason always seemed to drag a reluctant Amelia, her head bowed, her body stiff with resistance. To any outsider, it would look like coercion.

An impartial observer might assume Mason had blackmailed her, that she was trapped in a situation she couldn’t escape. Her struggles and pained expressions were real—but not for the reasons everyone believed.

The truth? Amelia wanted Mason. She just didn’t want the guilt of cheating on Daniel. Her internal conflict was genuine, but so was her desire.

And now, the Blackwoods finally understood.

Nathan sighed.

“People like her… they endure under the guise of decency, appearing as innocent victims,” he murmured. “Why didn’t she just tell him the truth?”

The Blackwoods mentally cursed. It all made sense. Amelia’s weak-willed nature made her easy to manipulate. Was it any wonder Daniel had misread the situation?

Nathan suspected Daniel had assumed Mason held some leverage over Amelia—compromising photos, perhaps—which explained her compliance.

But now, everything was clear.

And the worst part?

Nathan wondered if Amelia had ever truly loved Daniel at all.

###Chapter 230 The Unforgivable Truth

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't suppress the smirk tugging at her lips as she scrolled through her phone, absorbing every juicy tidbit of gossip flooding her notifications. The café around her buzzed with midday chatter, but her attention was laser-focused on the scandalous updates lighting up her screen.

"Oh, this is too good," she mused, stirring her iced latte absently.

A particularly salacious headline caught her eye: "Vincent Holloway Spotted Leaving Seraphina Delacroix’s Penthouse at Dawn—Again." Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the article, her pulse quickening. Vincent, the notorious playboy, and Seraphina, the rising starlet with a penchant for drama? This was the kind of gossip that could set social media ablaze.

She tapped the link, devouring the details. Blurry paparazzi photos showed Vincent slipping out of Seraphina’s building, his shirt rumpled, his usual devil-may-care grin firmly in place. The caption speculated whether this was just another fling or something more serious.

Evelyn snorted. "As if Vincent Holloway does ‘serious.’"

But then—her breath hitched.

Buried in the comments was a bombshell: "Rumor has it, Seraphina’s ex, Sebastian Hart, is fuming. Word on set is he nearly walked off his latest project when he heard."

Now that was intriguing. Sebastian, the brooding A-lister with a temper as infamous as his talent, had a history of volatile reactions when it came to Seraphina. If this was true…

Evelyn’s mind raced. She could already picture the fallout—tabloid wars, cryptic social media posts, maybe even a public confrontation. The entertainment world thrived on this kind of drama, and she was here for every second of it.

Just as she was about to dive deeper, her phone buzzed with a new message.

Lillian Graves (Assistant): "Evelyn, Preston wants to see you. Now. Something about ‘handling the press before things spiral.’"

Evelyn groaned. Of course. Her agent, Preston Whitmore, had a sixth sense for when she was indulging in gossip instead of working.

But as she stood, tossing cash onto the table, she couldn’t help one last glance at her screen.

This story was far from over—and she’d be damned if she missed a single twist.

Julian's brows knitted together in a deep frown, his mood already darkening by the second.

Enough.

The Blackwood family couldn't mock a kind soul for their naivety—they could only curse those vile individuals for their despicable actions.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Sophia Reed stood frozen in shock as Mason Wright’s true identity was exposed.

Her moral compass was unshakable, and the revelation that her boyfriend had once been a school bully was something she couldn’t stomach.

"Mason… is what he said true?" Sophia’s voice trembled as she stared at him, her eyes wide with disbelief.

Mason, battered and humiliated from the earlier scuffle, was still reeling. He had come to Daniel Wright’s wedding with nothing but arrogance, intending to mock the groom—not to have his past dredged up in front of everyone.

His face had changed drastically since his teenage years. Even if his name remained the same, he had been certain Daniel wouldn’t recognize him.

Damn it. How did he figure it out? Did that idiot Amelia betray me? No… she’s too stupid for that.

Mason didn’t dare react recklessly. Faced with Sophia’s piercing question, he knew lying wasn’t an option. With a pained expression, he stood and admitted, "Yes. It’s true. Back then, I was young and reckless. I just wanted attention—I never meant to be a villain."

He then turned to Daniel and bowed deeply. "I came today to see if the person I hurt has found happiness. If given the chance… I wanted to apologize. What I did was unforgivable, and I’ve paid for it—this face, the surgeries I needed after you hit me, was my punishment. I hope you can forgive the mistakes of my past."

Sophia’s shock didn’t immediately turn to disgust. She had no idea just how cruel Mason’s bullying had been.

The guests, equally unaware, murmured among themselves at his seemingly heartfelt apology.

"He came all this way just to make amends—that has to count for something."
"A man who admits his faults deserves a second chance."
"Teenagers make mistakes. Boys fight—it’s just how they are."
"He’s clearly changed."

But Daniel, his rage boiling over, lunged at Mason again, fist raised.

No one expected his fury to intensify after the apology. Disapproving whispers spread through the crowd—was Daniel being unreasonable?

The tension in the room was suffocating.

And then—

A sharp gasp cut through the air.

Sophia’s hand flew to her mouth as she stumbled back, her face paling.

Because Mason, in that split second before impact—smirked.

Just for a heartbeat.

But it was enough.

The mask had slipped.

And Daniel saw it too.

His punch never landed.

Instead, he froze, his eyes locking onto Mason’s with dawning horror.

"You…" Daniel’s voice was barely a whisper. "You’re not sorry at all."

The room fell deathly silent.

Mason’s expression smoothed back into remorse—but it was too late.

The truth was out.

And Sophia?

Her heart shattered in her chest.

Because the man she loved…

Had just shown her who he really was.

Nathan's fist came down harder than before, his knuckles white with fury as if he intended to beat Ethan to a pulp.

Hmph. If Daniel were clueless, he might have fallen for your lies. But now, spewing such disgusting nonsense in front of him? You deserve every bit of this.

Terrified by the murderous aura radiating from Daniel, Ethan stumbled backward, barely avoiding the next brutal swing.

Just as Daniel moved to strike again, Amelia's trembling voice cut through the tension.

"Daniel, stop!" Her voice was barely above a whisper, thick with unshed tears.

Daniel froze mid-motion, turning sharply to see Amelia standing at the foot of the stairs, gripping the doorframe for support.

Her hair cascaded loosely over her shoulders, and she wore nothing but a simple crimson robe—she hadn’t even bothered to change into another dress after the wedding fiasco.

She looked fragile, as if the slightest breeze might shatter her.

Under normal circumstances, Evelyn might have pitied her. But now? All she felt was a creeping sense of dread.

It wasn’t that Amelia was acting. No—that was the terrifying part. Every emotion she displayed was real.

One moment she’s devastated, the next she’s rushing to protect her lover? Evelyn scoffed inwardly. I was wrong. The mind of a delusional woman is impossible to decipher.

Amelia must have assumed the truth was out—that Ethan was willing to claim her, hence the fight. She had come down to apologize to Daniel before leaving with him.

The Blackwoods' gazes burned into Amelia like she was nothing more than human trash.

Seeing Amelia’s ghostly pallor, Serena hurried over to steady her. Though she had initially despised Amelia—as any high-society matriarch would—the presence of a child forced her to play the dutiful mother-in-law.

"Go back upstairs and rest," Serena urged gently. "Don’t trouble yourself with this mess."

But Amelia’s expression twisted in confusion. This wasn’t the reaction she had expected. She stood frozen, unable to voice the turmoil inside her.

Oh, how tragic. Evelyn nearly laughed. Amelia still sees Ethan as her first choice, with Daniel merely the backup. Meanwhile, Daniel thinks she’s afraid Ethan will expose their affair, so she’s trying to placate him by stopping the fight.

Your imagination is truly something. I won’t even comment further.

The Blackwoods exchanged uneasy glances.

The previous scandals—the illegitimate child, the affair—had been proven with concrete evidence and recordings Nathan had obtained. That was how Daniel had finally accepted the truth.

But now? Whether Amelia’s actions were voluntary or coerced was impossible to determine—unless she admitted her own guilt. And that was the most infuriating part.

Even if Nathan suddenly told Daniel that his pitiful ex-fiancée actually enjoyed Ethan’s mistreatment and didn’t deserve sympathy, it might only drive a wedge between them.

It wasn’t that Daniel was blinded by love. It was that—

The truth was unsolvable.

Nathan's words couldn't be taken at face value—not without solid proof against the woman he loved.

This was an impossible dilemma.

They had been foolishly optimistic before. Now, all they could do was watch as events spiraled beyond their control.

Daniel didn’t strike again. Instead, he crouched low, his burning glare fixed on the ashen-faced Mason.

"Listen carefully," he hissed, his voice laced with venom. "If you dare make another move, I won’t hold back. Get the hell out of here!"

Before Mason could even form a response, Daniel had already straightened, his piercing gaze shifting to Victor.

Though Victor was seething with anger, he couldn’t help but falter under his son’s intense stare.

"Dad," Daniel said coldly, "escort your guest out. We don’t need unnecessary complications."

The warning in his tone was unmistakable.

Victor’s expression nearly cracked. Daniel’s behavior was too erratic—too knowing. It was clear he had uncovered the truth.

Mason’s identity had been exposed.

That explained the sudden, brutal outburst.

Victor had always known the truth would surface eventually, but the timing was disastrous. Thankfully, Daniel wasn’t planning to air their dirty laundry in public—yet. There was still room to maneuver. After all, Victor valued his reputation too much to let things escalate.

Clearing his throat, Victor forced a strained smile. "This is supposed to be a joyous occasion. Let’s discuss this later."

It was as close to an admission as he would give.

Daniel clenched his jaw, swallowing his fury, and turned on his heel to leave.

Mason blinked in shock. When he met his father’s eyes, realization dawned—his secret was out.

Strangely, he felt a flicker of relief. For a moment, he had feared Amelia had betrayed him.

But if she hadn’t, he still had a chance. Daniel would remain none the wiser, raising his woman and child for him.

Mason staggered to his feet, his head throbbing, the metallic tang of blood still fresh in his mouth. As he turned, his gaze collided with Sophia’s—sharp, scrutinizing.

"Sophia, I—"

Before she could react, Victor quickly interjected, "My son acted rashly. My apologies to you both. Why don’t you follow the butler to the lounge and tend to your injuries?"

Victor didn’t actually care about Mason’s well-being. He just wanted him gone before Daniel lost his temper again. But seeing Sophia’s guarded expression, he had to play the gracious host. He couldn’t let his illegitimate son lose such a valuable connection.

A little kindness now could go a long way.

The question was—would it be enough?

The aftermath was quiet, yet deafening.

Sophia guided Mason away to tend to his injuries, her touch clinical, her expression unreadable. She wanted answers—needed them—but now wasn’t the time.

Mason’s fury simmered beneath the surface. This was all Daniel’s doing. The man had not only ruined his carefully laid plans but humiliated him in front of everyone. Those buried secrets were never meant to see the light of day.

Once patched up, he swore vengeance.

Then his phone buzzed. A single notification lit up the screen, and a cold smirk curled his lips.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Nathan, now privy to the truth, followed Daniel to confront Amelia. He didn’t stop them but issued a firm warning: Guard the door. No interruptions. What he had to say to Amelia was for her ears alone.

Evelyn bit her tongue, exchanging a glance with Nathan. Would Amelia finally come clean? Or would she cling to her lies, playing the victim till the bitter end?

If she confessed, the pieces would fall into place.

If she didn’t… well, they’d make sure the truth came out another way.

Elsewhere, Sophia, restless and troubled, wandered outside, hoping to find Mason and demand answers about his past. Instead, she spotted a phone lying abandoned in the grass—likely dropped by Daniel during the scuffle. She wasn’t one to snoop, but she intended to return it.

Before she could find Mason, however, she ran into Serena.

The older woman’s sharp gaze flicked to the phone in Sophia’s hand.

Whose is that?

Sophia hesitated. Something in Serena’s tone set her on edge.

Then the screen lit up again.

A message.

And what she saw made her blood run cold.

###Chapter 231 Have Some Dignity

The bedroom was dimly lit, the heavy curtains drawn shut. Amelia sat on the edge of the bed, her shoulders slumped, her fingers twisting the hem of her dress. She looked utterly broken, her usual poise shattered into fragments.

When Daniel stepped inside, he dismissed everyone with a sharp wave of his hand. The door clicked shut behind them, sealing the suffocating silence between the two. His jaw was clenched so tightly it ached, his knuckles white from the force of his grip. The rage simmering beneath his skin was volcanic—no man could stomach the knowledge that the woman he loved had endured such torment.

"Amelia," he began, his voice rough with suppressed fury. "We're getting married in two weeks. Is there something you want to tell me?"

Amelia flinched but didn’t speak. Instead, she lowered her head, letting her hair curtain her face like a shield. The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken guilt.

Daniel exhaled sharply, torn between pity and frustration.

For God’s sake, Amelia! Evelyn Sinclair, standing just outside the door with Nathan Blackwood, nearly groaned aloud. He’s giving you a chance to explain, and you’re still playing the victim? Open your mouth!

Nathan, sensing Evelyn’s irritation, rested a calming hand on her shoulder. "Easy," he murmured.

Downstairs, the Blackwoods exchanged uneasy glances. Was Amelia truly this oblivious, or was this all an act?

Inside the room, the silence persisted. Amelia’s fingers trembled in her lap, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Daniel couldn’t take it anymore. He shut his eyes briefly, as if bracing himself. "Amelia, I’ve protected you since we were in high school. Years. And yet, you couldn’t trust me enough to tell me that bastard was blackmailing you? That he forced himself on you—repeatedly?" His voice cracked. "If you had just told me, I would have ended him."

Amelia’s breath hitched. Tears spilled over, streaking down her cheeks. She covered her mouth with a shaking hand, her wide, wounded eyes locking onto his. "I—I didn’t mean to… I never wanted this…"

Daniel’s chest ached. Under normal circumstances, he would have pulled her into his arms, wiped her tears away. But not this time.

His voice hardened. "We’re getting married, Amelia. And you still kept this from me. If he threatened you again, were you just going to sleep with him behind my back?"

Amelia recoiled as if struck, her face draining of color.

Daniel couldn’t bear the look in her eyes, but he forced himself to stand firm. Because if the truth hadn’t come out today, that’s exactly what would have happened. Amelia was a victim, yes—but she was also weak. Pathetic. And infuriatingly naive.

And yet, he still—

Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She curled up on her plush velvet sofa, a steaming cup of Earl Grey in hand, scrolling through her phone with a smirk.

Oh, this is too good.

Her mind-reading ability—a secret she guarded fiercely—had just tuned into the most delicious piece of gossip. Across the city, in a high-end restaurant, Nathan Blackwood’s sharp-tongued secretary, Victoria Hayes, was having a meltdown.

"He didn’t even look at me during the meeting!" Victoria’s inner voice screeched. "After everything I’ve done for him! That new intern better watch her back."

Evelyn stifled a laugh, nearly spilling her tea. Oh, the drama.

Her phone buzzed—a message from her agent, Serena Whitmore. "Emergency meeting at 3 PM. Wear something killer. Big news."

Evelyn arched a brow. Big news? She could already sense the tension radiating from Serena’s thoughts, a chaotic swirl of excitement and apprehension.

Before she could dig deeper, another mental voice cut in—smooth, deep, and unmistakably Nathan’s. "Why the hell is Victoria glaring at the intern?"

Evelyn’s lips curved. Because she’s plotting your assistant’s downfall, darling.

She set down her cup, stretching lazily. Today was going to be fun.

At Blackwood Enterprises, Nathan massaged his temples as Victoria’s shrill complaints echoed in his head—both audibly and through Evelyn’s unwelcome psychic broadcast.

"If he promotes her over me, I swear—"

God, make it stop. He shot a glare at Victoria, who immediately pasted on a professional smile.

His phone lit up with a notification: Evelyn Sinclair is typing…

A second later:
"Tell Victoria to ease up on the intern. Jealousy is so last season."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. How does she even—?

Another message:
"3 PM. Serena’s office. You’re coming with me."

He scowled. Like hell I am.

But even as he thought it, he knew resistance was futile. Evelyn always got her way—especially when she could hear his objections before he voiced them.

Meanwhile, across town, Cassandra—Nathan’s first love—sat in a dimly lit café, stirring her latte absently. Her phone buzzed with a headline:

"Blackwood & Sinclair Spotted Together—Again!"

Her grip tightened on the spoon. After all these years…

A shadow fell over her table. She looked up—and froze.

"Long time no see," murmured a familiar, honeyed voice.

Cassandra’s breath hitched. No. It can’t be.

But there he stood: Daniel Prescott, Evian’s husband—and the man who’d shattered her heart a decade ago.

His smile was razor-sharp. "Miss me?"

The bedroom was heavy with tension as Amelia sat on the edge of the bed, her face a portrait of devastation.

When Daniel entered, he dismissed everyone else with a sharp gesture before turning to her, his expression unreadable. His fists remained clenched at his sides, knuckles white with suppressed fury. No man could stomach the knowledge that the woman he loved had endured such humiliation.

"Amelia," Daniel's voice was rough, strained. "We're getting married in two weeks. Is there something you need to tell me?"

Amelia flinched but didn’t answer. Instead, she lowered her gaze, her silence stretching between them like a chasm.

Daniel exhaled sharply, torn between pity and frustration.

Seriously? Evelyn Sinclair, standing beside Nathan Blackwood, barely suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. He’s practically spelling it out for her, and she’s still playing the wounded dove? Unbelievable. Her irritation must have been palpable, because Nathan reached over and gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

Downstairs, the Blackwoods exchanged uneasy glances. Was Amelia truly this oblivious, or was this some twisted act?

Inside the room, the silence thickened. Amelia remained motionless, as if her refusal to speak could erase the truth.

Daniel, though kind-hearted, wasn’t a fool. He couldn’t let this slide.

"Amelia," he said, his voice thick with pain. *"I’ve protected you since we were teenagers. I’ve stood by you through everything. So why didn’t you trust me? That bastard forced himself on you—*repeatedly. Why didn’t you tell me? Why didn’t you let me help you?"

Amelia’s breath hitched. The fragile hope in her eyes shattered. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she pressed a trembling hand to her lips.

"I—I didn’t mean to… I never wanted this…"

Daniel’s chest ached. Normally, he would have pulled her into his arms, soothed her pain. But not this time.

"We’re getting married," he said through gritted teeth. "And you still kept this from me. What if he threatens you again? Were you just going to let it happen? Were you going to betray me?"

Amelia recoiled as if struck. Her face drained of color, her lips parting in silent horror.

Daniel couldn’t bear to look at her. But he had to say it. Because if this truth hadn’t come out today, it would have festered. Destroyed them.

He knew Amelia was a victim. Knew she was weak, pitiable, infuriatingly naive.

But damn it, why hadn’t she trusted him? Why hadn’t she spoken up the first time?

Daniel could only console himself with these bitter thoughts.

"I wouldn't! How could I—" Amelia sobbed, shaking her head violently. She had agreed to marry Daniel—how could she betray him again?

Yet Daniel's next words shattered her fragile defense. "But you were planning to make me raise that bastard's child, weren't you?"

Amelia's face drained of color. Her lips trembled, but no words came out—only silent tears, as if she were the one who had suffered the greatest injustice.

Her lack of denial crushed Daniel’s spirit. He had always prided himself on being strong, but now, he felt utterly defeated.

He could try to understand her predicament—but he wasn’t a fool.

"This has to be reported to the police. That bastard has to pay for what he did," Daniel said, his voice steel.

Amelia’s head snapped up. "No!"

Daniel froze. A sickening realization crept into his chest. "Don’t worry. Whatever leverage he has, I’ll handle it. I won’t let him—"

"Please—just forget it ever happened. If you don’t… I can’t go on living." She slid off the bed, nearly collapsing at his feet in desperation.

Are you seriously acting right now?

How effortlessly she played the victim. If she had just admitted, "I did it willingly," Daniel’s police report would have no ground. But her theatrics—her "I’ll die if you expose him"—were meant to manipulate him into thinking she feared retaliation.

She was protecting Ethan.

Pretending to love Daniel while shielding the man who had ruined her.

You really do love him, don’t you?

Nathan’s breathing hitched slightly as he listened. Daniel’s years of devotion had been wasted on this woman.

Though the Blackwoods could only hear Evelyn’s scathing commentary, they could piece together the scene. How could someone so cruel wear such an innocent mask?

To Daniel, Amelia’s reaction seemed like trauma—a desperate reflex to bury the truth. No matter how many times he promised to protect her, she never trusted him.

He exhaled sharply. "Fine. I won’t call the police."

As an officer, his first instinct was justice. But if that wasn’t an option, he’d make Ethan pay another way—even if the man was his half-brother. Daniel wouldn’t let him walk free.

This was revenge—for himself and for Amelia. His hatred burned raw.

For Amelia, as long as the police weren’t involved, everything was negotiable.

But then—Daniel asked about the child.

Amelia froze.

Her hands instinctively cradled her stomach.

She had grown attached.

And that was the final betrayal.

A dark expression flickered across Daniel Wright's face as he took in the scene before him.

Tears welled up in Amelia Bennett's eyes, her voice trembling with desperation. "You despise me now, don't you? You can't stand the sight of me anymore. That's why you're refusing to marry me—why you're rejecting our child, isn't it?"

Had Nathan Blackwood not held Evelyn Sinclair back, she would have stormed in without hesitation.

For heaven's sake, have some dignity! The child may be innocent, but why should Daniel be forced to accept it? Have you lost your mind?

Daniel's chest tightened as he stared at Amelia's tear-streaked face. He inhaled deeply, struggling to keep his voice steady. "Amelia, I don't hate you. You were a victim in this. I won't abandon you or blame you for what happened. But this child… I can't accept it."

The moment the words left his lips, guilt gnawed at him. Maybe he didn't love Amelia as deeply as he had believed.

In movies, men would embrace their wives' children—even those fathered by others—without hesitation, loving them unconditionally for the sake of their beloved.

But Daniel knew he couldn't do that. The mere thought of raising another man's child—especially under these circumstances—filled him with a simmering rage. He knew he could never love this child, and bringing it into a home where it would only suffer was unthinkable.

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating. Amelia's sobs were the only sound in the room, each one a sharp reminder of the shattered future they had once envisioned together.

Daniel clenched his fists, his jaw set.

He had made his decision.

Now, he just had to live with it.
###Chapter 232: Exposed in the Act

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble countertops of her kitchen. She sipped her coffee, the rich aroma filling the air, as her phone buzzed insistently on the counter.

Lillian Graves’ name flashed across the screen. Evelyn swiped to answer, pressing the phone to her ear. "Lillian, what’s the emergency this early?"

"Emergency?" Lillian’s voice crackled with barely contained excitement. "More like a golden opportunity. Preston Whitmore just called—he wants you for his new project. And guess who’s co-producing?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her mug. "Don’t tell me it’s Donovan Sharpe."

"Bingo." Lillian’s grin was practically audible. "And Nathan Blackwood is already attached as the lead."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Nathan. The man whose piercing gaze had haunted her dreams since their last disastrous encounter at the charity gala. The man who had looked at her like she was a puzzle he couldn’t solve—or worse, didn’t want to.

She set her mug down with a sharp clink. "Tell Preston I’ll consider it."

Lillian scoffed. "Consider it? Evelyn, this is the role of a lifetime. The script is brilliant, the budget is insane, and the chemistry between you and Nathan on screen would be—"

"Nonexistent," Evelyn cut in. "We can’t stand each other, remember?"

A beat of silence. Then, Lillian’s voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Or maybe that’s exactly why it’ll work."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She could already picture Nathan’s smirk, the way his dark eyes would gleam with challenge the moment she walked onto set. The thought sent an unwelcome thrill down her spine.

Before she could respond, another call beeped through—an unknown number. Frowning, she switched lines. "Evelyn Sinclair."

"Miss Sinclair." The smooth, velvety voice sent a jolt through her. Nathan. Of course. "Heard you’re thinking about turning down Preston’s offer."

Her grip on the phone tightened. "And how, exactly, did you hear that?"

A low chuckle. "Let’s just say Donovan has loose lips when he’s had too much champagne."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "What do you want, Nathan?"

"I want you to take the role." His tone shifted, the teasing edge replaced by something darker, more intense. "Because I know you’re just as curious as I am about what happens when we stop pretending we hate each other."

Her breath hitched. Damn him.

The line went dead before she could reply, leaving her staring at her reflection in the polished countertop—cheeks flushed, lips parted.

Lillian’s voice buzzed from the other line. "Evelyn? You still there?"

She switched back, heart pounding. "Tell Preston I’m in."

Lillian whooped. "I knew you’d see reason!"

Evelyn hung up, pressing her palms against the cool marble.

This was either the best decision she’d ever made—or the worst.

And Nathan Blackwood was going to make sure she regretted every second of it.

"Daniel..." Amelia's voice trembled, tears cascading down her cheeks as she clutched at Daniel's sleeve, desperation lacing her every word. "You know how much I've longed for a family—for a child. I—"

"We can have other children," Daniel cut in, his jaw tight with restrained emotion. "Why cling to this one? Don't you see it as a constant reminder of betrayal? Every time you look at this child, won’t it haunt you?"

Amelia’s breath hitched, her sobs freezing mid-air. The raw bluntness of his words struck her like a physical blow.

Exhaustion carved deep lines into Daniel’s face as he pinched the bridge of his nose. "The wedding proceeds today. But afterward, you choose: either give up the child, and we rebuild, or keep it—and we don’t register the marriage. I’ll announce the divorce and take full responsibility."

The ceremony had to happen. Calling it off now would unleash a storm of scandal upon Amelia. After everything, he couldn’t bear to subject her to that cruelty.

Amelia’s eyes widened, her grip slackening as if her lifeline had snapped. The world tilted beneath her, waves of panic threatening to pull her under. She reached for him again, fingers trembling.

Daniel stepped back, his voice steel. "This is my final offer, Amelia."

A broken whimper escaped her as fresh tears spilled over.

Nearby, Evelyn and Nathan exchanged relieved glances. At least he’s not blind to her deceit. But Nathan’s frown deepened. Still too lenient. She doesn’t deserve choices—or this wedding.

Daniel’s hollow gaze flickered toward the door. "The ceremony starts in an hour. Decide by then."

He’d given all he could to the woman he once loved.

As he strode out, his steps faltered. Nathan moved to steady him, but Daniel waved him off. "I’m fine."

Behind them, Amelia’s weeping crescendoed. Daniel flinched but didn’t turn back. "Let’s go."

Downstairs in the lounge, Daniel slumped into a chair, his voice eerily calm. "I’m ruining Ethan for this."

Nathan arched a brow. "And the wedding? You’re really going through with it?"

Evelyn shot her husband an approving look. Brave man.

Daniel’s smile was brittle. "Some farces must play out to the end."

Evelyn couldn't simply stand by and watch Daniel be deceived. Though it wasn’t their business, she’d feel guilty if she didn’t at least try to warn him.

But if they interfered and he dismissed their concerns, then she’d wash her hands of it.

Sure enough, Daniel stiffened, his expression darkening. "This hurts, but Amelia doesn’t deserve to be abandoned. She was forced—she didn’t betray me willingly."

He assumed they were just being protective.

"Really? You’re sure it wasn’t consensual?" Nathan countered, his tone icy.

"What are you implying?" Daniel’s voice wavered.

"Maybe she wasn’t as reluctant as she claims. Maybe she wanted it from the start," Nathan said bluntly.

"You’re victim-blaming!" Daniel snapped, his fists clenching.

Evelyn cut in, "Are you absolutely certain she was coerced?"

Daniel hesitated, but before he could respond, Nathan added, "Think about it. If even one of those surveillance clips was from their first time, what does that tell you?"

Daniel froze, realization dawning. "But… we don’t know if the first time was recorded."

Nathan shrugged. "Exactly. So consider the possibilities. A wedding is a big commitment. Don’t waste it on someone who might not deserve it. We don’t trust her."

With that, Nathan took Evelyn’s arm and steered her away, leaving Daniel to his thoughts.

Evelyn frowned as they walked. "What was that about?"

Nathan explained, "In those videos, Amelia barely resisted. If she were truly a victim, she would’ve sought help immediately. But she didn’t. That means either the first incident wasn’t caught on camera… or she was never forced at all."

Evelyn understood—Nathan had planted doubt in Daniel’s mind.

"Do you think it’ll work?" she asked.

Nathan shook his head. "No idea. We’ll see."

When they rejoined Nathan’s friends, they were bombarded with questions.

Meanwhile, Sophia Reed had been about to leave, frustrated by her lack of answers, when she spotted Daniel in the lounge.

After a moment’s hesitation, she approached him. He stood rigid, his brow furrowed in deep thought.

"Mr. Wright?"

Daniel Wright jerked his head up, confusion clouding his features. When his gaze landed on Sophia Reed, his expression settled into a frown. "Hasn't he left yet?"

Sophia pressed her lips together, her fingers tightening around the strap of her purse. "He's still treating his injuries. He'll be gone soon. But first, I need answers."

Daniel studied her for a moment before realization dawned. "You want to know about his past?"

She gave a stiff nod.

Without hesitation, Daniel recounted Mason Wright’s high school years—the fights, the betrayals, the calculated cruelty. When he revealed the true reason behind Mason’s disfigurement, Sophia’s face drained of color.

"Is any of this true?" Her voice was barely a whisper, her eyes glassy with unshed tears. She refused to let them fall, but the pain was evident. Daniel couldn’t help but pity her.

"Ms. Reed, if you doubt me, investigate it yourself. He pursued you with an agenda. There are things I can’t disclose, but I’ll warn you—the man you’re involved with is a predator in disguise."

"Daniel!" A sharp voice cut through the tension.

Daniel turned to see his father, Victor Reed, striding toward them. The lounge was empty, but the open corridors meant voices carried. Victor had heard enough.

A cold smirk curled Daniel’s lips. If Mason dared to play these games, he wouldn’t let him keep Sophia as his pawn.

Victor opened his mouth to intervene, but Sophia was already storming off, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor as she headed straight for Mason’s room.

In her haste, she nearly collided with a passing waiter but barely registered the near-miss.

Unable to stop her, Victor turned his fury on Daniel. "What the hell are you doing?"

"Did I lie, Father? Or do you also want your bastard son to marry the Reed heiress so he can finally stake his claim on our family?" Daniel’s voice dripped with venom. He wasn’t blind to the machinations of the elite—he just chose not to play along.

"Enough! You don’t know what you’re talking about!" Victor’s face darkened. He had known this confrontation was inevitable.

"Mason was a mistake from my past, but he’s still your brother."

Daniel let out a bitter laugh. He wanted to throw every disgusting detail of Mason’s betrayals in his father’s face—but would Victor even survive the truth?

"Save your excuses for Mother. She’s the one who deserves an explanation."

Victor paled. "Your mother’s health is fragile. She can’t handle this kind of shock. We need to handle this carefully."

"Carefully?" Daniel scoffed. "You didn’t think about her health when you brought your bastard into our lives."

The air between them crackled with unspoken accusations.

And somewhere down the hall, Sophia was about to confront the man who had lied to her from the very beginning.

"Men of our standing all indulge in..."

"Just because others wallow in filth doesn’t mean you have to roll in it too. If others eat garbage, must you follow suit?"

Daniel Wright’s sudden crudeness nearly made Victor Reed faint, but it only proved how enraged Daniel truly was.

"Fine, fine. I won’t argue with you. The ceremony is about to begin. Mind your manners and don’t embarrass the family further," Victor snapped before storming off.

Daniel stood frozen in place. The wedding...

Blinded by fury, Victor marched away, completely unaware of the trembling figure concealed just around the corner.

It was Serena Collins. She had overheard everything—clutching Daniel’s phone, the damning surveillance footage still glaring on the screen.

She had come to confront her son about Amelia Bennett and Mason Wright, only to learn that Mason was her husband’s bastard son. The revelation hit her like a freight train, nearly sending her to her knees.

But as memories of her son’s suffering flashed through her mind, her rage burned hotter. A mother’s strength was unyielding. She refused to collapse.

She didn’t buy Amelia’s victim act. She had always despised the girl’s whiny, petty demeanor. Even if Amelia was a victim, Serena would never allow a woman who had been with an illegitimate son to marry Daniel. Especially not when the child’s paternity was in question.

Her son was too honorable—he’d endure even if it destroyed him. But she wouldn’t let that happen.

Gripping the phone, Serena spun on her heel and stalked away. She was going to find Amelia.

Meanwhile, Sophia Reed was still searching for Mason but couldn’t locate him in the unfamiliar estate. Frustrated, she had no choice but to keep looking.

Serena, too, failed to find Amelia. The makeup artists informed her the bride had stepped out for air and would return shortly.

Impatience gnawing at her, Serena headed straight for the security room.

At that moment, Evelyn Sinclair was half-heartedly engaging in small talk while straining to catch any new developments.

Unbelievable. Amelia snuck off to meet Mason, confessing that Daniel knows everything. She’s begging Mason to take her away—she refuses to abort his child. But instead of saving her, Mason tells her to go through with the wedding and stay with Daniel. He even suggests she abort the baby. And now, furious over the beating he took, Mason plans to cuckold Daniel right here, right now—

Wait… What the hell? They’re actually—

The Blackwoods stiffened in shock. Was she implying…? Were they really doing something so shameless now?

Perfect. This is our chance. Bring Daniel to catch them in the act! The truth will be undeniable!

Before Evelyn could react, Nathan Blackwood rose abruptly. "I just remembered something I need to clarify with Daniel. Let’s go find him."

###Chapter 233: The Shocking Surveillance Footage

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the latest revisions. The role was challenging—a woman torn between love and ambition—but something about it felt incomplete.

Her phone buzzed, and Lillian Graves’ name flashed on the screen. "Evelyn, Preston Whitmore wants to meet you at the studio in an hour. He says it’s urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Urgent? Preston wasn’t one for dramatics unless it was absolutely necessary. She quickly typed back, "Tell him I’ll be there."

Nathan Blackwood leaned against the polished mahogany desk in his office, his sharp blue eyes scanning the financial reports in front of him. The numbers were solid, but his mind kept drifting elsewhere—specifically, to the woman who had occupied his thoughts more than he cared to admit.

A knock interrupted his musings. "Mr. Blackwood, your sister is here to see you," his assistant announced.

Before he could respond, Sophia Blackwood strode in, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "You’ve been avoiding my calls," she accused, crossing her arms.

Nathan exhaled. "I’ve been busy."

"Too busy for family?" Sophia arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Or just too busy avoiding the fact that Evelyn Sinclair is back in town?"

His jaw tightened. "That’s none of your concern."

Sophia smirked. "Oh, it is when you’ve been moping around like a lovesick puppy for months."

Nathan shot her a glare, but before he could retort, his phone rang. It was Donovan Sharpe.

"Blackwood, we have a problem," the producer said without preamble. "The lead actress just dropped out of Midnight Echoes. We need Evelyn Sinclair, and we need her now."

Nathan’s grip on the phone tightened. Of all the actresses in Hollywood, why did it have to be her?

Evelyn stepped into the studio, the familiar scent of fresh paint and coffee filling the air. Preston Whitmore stood near the director’s chair, deep in conversation with Donovan Sharpe.

"Evelyn," Preston greeted, his expression unreadable. "Thanks for coming on such short notice."

She nodded. "What’s this about?"

Donovan cleared his throat. "We want you for Midnight Echoes."

Evelyn blinked. "The Blackwood Productions film?"

"The very one," Preston confirmed.

Her pulse quickened. Working with Nathan’s company again—after everything that had happened—was a risk. But the script was brilliant, the kind of role that could redefine her career.

Before she could respond, the studio doors swung open, and Nathan himself strode in, his presence commanding the room.

Their eyes locked, and for a moment, the past five years of silence and unspoken words hung between them.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low.

She lifted her chin. "Nathan."

Donovan glanced between them, sensing the tension. "So… do we have a deal?"

Evelyn hesitated, then smiled. "Let’s talk terms."

Nathan’s gaze darkened, but he said nothing.

The game was on.

When Nathan announced his intention to find Daniel, Evelyn didn’t need any prompting—she eagerly followed.

Talk about perfect timing. Though maybe I shouldn’t watch what happens next. Some things can’t be unseen.

Nathan’s expression twisted in disgust. He had interacted with Amelia a handful of times, but this just proved you could never judge someone by appearances.

The Blackwoods, overhearing the plan to catch the cheating pair, were instantly intrigued. They began discreetly observing, though without knowing the exact location, they had to wait for Nathan and Evelyn to locate Daniel first.

Meanwhile, the pre-wedding festivities were in full swing. A professional emcee held the microphone, working the crowd into a celebratory mood.

Though the bride and groom weren’t set to appear just yet, Victor and Serena occasionally stepped in to humor the emcee with a few words.

Victor stood at the center of the gathering, but Serena was nowhere in sight.

Evelyn and Nathan headed to the lounge in search of Daniel but found it empty.

Where is he? Oh, right—the garden. He must be cooling off. Starting to have doubts, isn’t he? He’s sensing something’s off. And yet, he still hasn’t called off the wedding. Is he really that afraid of wronging Amelia? A woman who plays the victim is like poison to a man’s common sense!

Nathan didn’t waste time deliberating. Instead of heading to the garden, he simply pulled out his phone and dialed.

The ringing came from nearby.

They turned. Down the corridor, Serena stood lost in thought, Daniel’s phone in hand as she walked toward the ballroom.

Huh? Why does Serena have Daniel’s phone? Oh—Stephanie picked it up and gave it to her. Wait… isn’t she heading toward the restroom where those two are…?

The Blackwoods, watching from a distance, exchanged glances. Restroom? Which one? There are restrooms in every direction—north, south, east, west. Which one is it?

No way. Serena saw the surveillance footage on Daniel’s phone and went looking for Amelia. When she couldn’t find her, she checked the cameras and saw Amelia and Mason slipping into the same restroom one after the other. This is explosive! Hah, those two are in deep trouble now. Do we even need to find Daniel anymore? I’d rather just follow Serena and watch the fireworks.

Nathan, however, was adamant about finding Daniel quickly. He remembered Daniel’s mother’s fragile health—she wouldn’t handle this kind of shock well.

Turning to Evelyn, he said, “Mrs. Reed is probably just trying to return Daniel’s phone. Evelyn, go tell her I’ll bring Daniel to her. She can wait here.”

If Serena suddenly took a turn for the worse, Evelyn would be there to notice immediately.

This request aligned perfectly with Evelyn's intentions, so she nodded without hesitation.

The two parted ways. The moment Evelyn was out of sight, Nathan immediately headed to the secluded garden, where he found Daniel waiting.

Daniel's expression darkened when he saw Nathan. "Any updates?"

He was genuinely afraid that Nathan's suspicions might be true, and the weight of it made his chest tighten.

Ignoring Daniel's grim demeanor, Nathan cut straight to the point. "Your mother seems to be frantically searching for you—with your phone in hand."

Daniel froze. Only then did he realize his phone was missing. Panic surged through him. Had his mother discovered something? Without wasting another second, he followed Nathan back toward the ballroom.

Meanwhile, Nathan caught fragments of Evelyn's thoughts through their connection.

Wait… Is Serena eavesdropping at the door? She looks pale—like she just heard something devastating. She’s practically trembling with rage.

Nathan frowned, concerned for Serena’s state.

At least she’s holding it together. But why isn’t she storming in to confront them? Does she really intend to endure this humiliation just to avoid a scandal at the wedding? She’s actually walking away? Then… should we still bring Daniel to witness the truth?

Nathan hesitated. Perhaps Serena wanted to preserve the family’s dignity, but Daniel needed to see the betrayal for himself. If he didn’t, he might remain blind to the deception forever.

Just as Nathan was weighing their next move, Daniel suddenly stopped. "Mom?"

They had just re-entered the ballroom, intending to take the quickest route to Evelyn, when they spotted Serena weaving through the crowd near the wedding staff.

Daniel moved to rush toward her, but by the time he pushed past the guests, she had vanished again.

Nathan caught another wave of Evelyn’s thoughts.

What is she doing? Why is she coming and going like this? And why isn’t she dragging Daniel in there to expose them? Wait—is that a microphone? No way… Did she just unlock the restroom door and plant a mic inside? Oh my god… Is she—

Before Daniel could chase after his mother again, Nathan grabbed his arm.

"What’s wrong?" Daniel demanded, anxiety lacing his voice. He was terrified that Serena might do something drastic—like halt the wedding entirely—regardless of whether Amelia was a victim or not.

Even now, doubt gnawed at him, but he couldn’t abandon his mother in the middle of such a public event.

Just as he was lost in thought, the wedding setup underwent a sudden, dramatic change.

The massive screen, which had been displaying romantic wedding photos, flickered—then split into eight separate surveillance feeds.

Gasps erupted across the ballroom.

The truth was about to be exposed.

The surveillance footage played across the massive screen, revealing hotel corridors from different dates. In each clip, Amelia Bennett and Mason Wright could be seen pulling at each other as they made their way toward a room.

The once lively ballroom fell into stunned silence as guests gradually noticed the scandal unfolding before their eyes.

Victor Reed, who had been holding a microphone and chatting with the host, his back turned to the screen, sensed the shift in the atmosphere. Confused, he turned—only to freeze, the microphone slipping from his grasp and hitting the floor with a sharp, echoing clang.

Then, all eyes landed on Daniel Wright.

Whispers erupted like wildfire.

"Isn't that his fiancée?"
"Wait—wasn’t that the same guy he just punched?"
"Were they really going to a hotel room together?"
"This can’t be real. Back in school, Mason used to torment Amelia."
"Do you think she was forced? She doesn’t look willing."
"Even if she was, it doesn’t change the fact that she betrayed Daniel."
"Hold on—they said they got married because she was pregnant. So… whose child is it?"
"I don’t even want to say it. This is beyond humiliating."
"Who leaked this? Is Mason trying to ruin Daniel?"
"No, Mason came with his girlfriend tonight."

At that moment, the crowd remembered the other key player in this scandal.

Sophia Reed had been searching for Mason, growing increasingly frustrated when she couldn’t find him. She had just asked the butler for help when she stepped into the ballroom—and saw the damning footage.

First, she’d learned that her boyfriend had been a bully in his youth. Now, this.

Her mind reeled.

Slowly, she approached Daniel, who stood frozen in shock.

"What is this?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "Is that… them? Did Mason force her?"

Despite everything, Sophia still wanted to believe the girl was innocent.

###Chapter 234: A Wedding Turned Nightmare

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the bustling café, she knew today would be anything but ordinary. The air was thick with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and hushed whispers—gossip, the kind that made her pulse quicken with anticipation.

As she settled into her usual corner booth, her fingers absentmindedly tracing the rim of her latte, her mind involuntarily tuned into the thoughts swirling around her. It was a gift—or a curse—she’d long since learned to live with.

"Did you hear? Nathan Blackwood was seen leaving Seraphina Delacroix’s penthouse at three in the morning!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. Nathan? The man who’d barely spared her a second glance at last week’s gala? The same Nathan whose piercing gaze had haunted her dreams?

She forced herself to exhale slowly, schooling her expression into one of mild disinterest. But inside, her thoughts raced.

"Oh, please," another voice scoffed mentally. "That’s old news. The real scandal is what happened between Sebastian Hart and Isabelle Laurent at the studio after hours."

Evelyn’s lips twitched. Sebastian Hart? The brooding actor who’d once glared daggers at her during an interview? Now that was a twist she hadn’t seen coming.

A third mental voice, dripping with faux sympathy, chimed in. "Poor Vanessa Sterling. Harrison Montgomery’s wife still has no idea about their little ‘arrangement.’"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her cup. Harrison Montgomery? The charming A-lister who’d publicly declared his undying love for his wife, Natalie Whitaker, just last month? The hypocrisy was almost laughable.

She leaned back, feigning disinterest as she sipped her latte, but her mind was a whirlwind of revelations. Each tidbit of gossip was a puzzle piece, and she couldn’t help but slot them together, forming a picture far more scandalous than she’d imagined.

Then, just as she was about to leave, a new thought slammed into her consciousness—sharp, urgent, and unmistakably directed at her.

"Evelyn Sinclair knows too much."

Her blood ran cold.

The voice was unfamiliar, laced with a threat that sent a shiver down her spine. She scanned the café, but no one met her gaze. Yet the warning lingered, heavy in the air.

Someone knew about her ability.

And they weren’t happy about it.

With practiced calm, Evelyn stood, tossing a few bills onto the table. But as she strode toward the exit, her mind raced with one terrifying question:

Who else was listening?

Nathan's lips trembled, his throat tightening as he struggled to respond to Sophia. A chilling realization struck him—this was his mother's doing.

She knows.

It's over.

Yet, this wasn't Serena's usual style. Even if she was furious, convinced that Amelia was to blame, she wouldn’t resort to sabotaging the wedding so publicly. Humiliating their own family wasn’t her way.

Before Nathan could react to the scandalous footage on the screen, Victor's frantic voice cut through the chaos. "Who the hell is behind this? Turn it off—now! It's all lies!"

Though Nathan understood his father was trying to protect the family’s reputation, a cold numbness spread through his chest. His father’s first instinct wasn’t concern for him—his son, publicly shamed by an illegitimate child.

Drawing a sharp breath, Nathan forced himself to play along, determined to contain the damage.

But Daniel stopped him.

"Hold on."

Nathan stared at him in shock.

What Nathan couldn’t see, Daniel understood. This wasn’t about revenge. Serena was fighting to shield her son.

Amid Nathan’s confusion and Victor’s furious demands, an unmistakable sound crackled through the speakers.

Though not loud, the gasps that followed were deafening.

Parents immediately covered their children’s ears. Adults flushed crimson, some turning away in mortification.

This isn’t just an affair exposé—this is… explicit.

Who in their right mind would play this at a wedding? Was there more? Were they about to witness an entire scandalous video? Had the Fords lost their minds?

The whispers were frantic.

By tomorrow, this will be everywhere.

Yet, no one felt like a lucky spectator. Only sheer, suffocating embarrassment.

In the stunned silence, no one even thought to cut the audio.

Nathan’s face darkened, blood roaring in his ears. He stood frozen, staring at Daniel, wondering if he had released something worse—something even Serena would unleash.

The nightmare had only just begun.

Meanwhile, Sophia Reed, who stood frozen at the side, hadn’t fully processed what was happening, but her cheeks burned with humiliation all the same. Thankfully, the ordeal ended swiftly, allowing her to finally exhale in relief.

Then, Mason Wright’s voice cut through the air like a blade.

“Amelia,” he drawled, voice dripping with arrogance, “tell me—who’s better? Me or Daniel?”

A choked gasp followed.

For a fleeting moment, many genuinely believed the answer had been forced—even Daniel Wright himself dared to hope.

Mason’s fingers tightened. “Well? Are you going to answer me or not?”

Amelia Bennett sobbed, her voice trembling. “You know you’re the only one I’ve ever loved. I never let him touch me. There’s only ever been you.”

Evelyn Sinclair smirked internally. Well, even though this was mortifying to witness, I have to admit—they played their parts flawlessly. Without that little performance, Daniel might not have given up so easily.

Nathan Blackwood turned his head just in time to see Daniel sway on his feet, his expression shattering into blank devastation. It was the look of a man whose heart had just been ripped out.

Among the gathered spectators—especially their old high school classmates—shock rippled through the crowd.

What in the world? Amelia and Mason? Since when did Amelia have feelings for Mason?

“That’s more like it,” Mason purred, satisfaction lacing his tone.

Amelia sniffled. “Why… why are you doing this? You already have Sophia. Why torment me like this?”

Mason chuckled darkly. “What’s wrong? Jealous? It’s not my fault you don’t have her connections. But between us? I’d still pick you. She’s so damn boring—prudish and rigid. Makes me wait forever before she’ll even let me kiss her. If it weren’t for what her family name gets me, I wouldn’t bother.”

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. Oh, you two are really laying it on thick. Or maybe fate just took pity on Sophia and decided to rip the blindfold off her eyes. I wonder if she’s still here to witness this.

Nathan’s gaze flicked to Sophia, whose face had gone deathly pale. The truth had struck her like a physical blow.

Among the onlookers, many were associates of the Reed family. Their shock deepened at Mason’s words. Who was this reckless young man, daring to play games with a Reed heiress?

Slowly, Victor Reed regained his composure, his expression a storm of emotions. He knew now—his illegitimate son was nothing but a liability.

I can’t let anyone find out that Mason not only stole his brother’s fiancée but also schemed against another family’s daughter.

But in the next heartbeat, Victor’s carefully constructed mask shattered.

"I understand, truly I do. I know the struggles you face as an illegitimate child—the constant need to prove yourself, to compete with Daniel for your father’s approval. It breaks my heart to see you like this, but you—"

Evelyn thought, Oh, please. You two are the ones destroying Daniel, aren’t you? The hypocrisy is astounding. But, oh, how delightful that you admitted it. Go on… Keep digging your own grave, hahaha!

Aside from Evelyn’s silent, mocking laughter, the Blackwood family stood frozen in shock.

What in the world is happening? An illegitimate child? This is the kind of scandal even soap operas wouldn’t dare script. A half-brother sleeping with his brother’s fiancée? Wait… Why does this sound so familiar? No way! Victor Reed was supposed to be a devoted husband! How could he have an illegitimate son, and worse, allow him to attend his legitimate son’s wedding? Has he lost his mind? Does Serena know?

"Shut up! Why are you bringing this up now? Do you look down on me too?"

"I don’t. I love you. Ever since that rainy afternoon in our sophomore year, when you kissed me for the first time, I was lost to you. I knew your possessiveness was just a mask for your emptiness. I understand."

"So that’s why you suddenly ran to Daniel for protection after I cut things off. You even flaunted it in front of me. You were just trying to get my attention! The funniest part? Daniel fought me over and over for your sake. He even got injured—lost his chance to serve in the air force. I heard it was his lifelong dream, and you ruined it for him. Hahaha. You’ve been my little puppet all along, helping me crush his dreams and the future the Reed family had planned for him. You’ve done me a great favor!"

"No! That wasn’t my intention! Don’t say such things. Daniel is a good man—my savior. I’m the one who wronged him."

Evelyn smirked internally. Oh, Amelia, those crocodile tears won’t fool anyone. I wonder if Daniel regrets playing the hero now.

Nathan glanced at Daniel, who stood rigid at the edge of the room.

Daniel’s expression was unreadable. He had never imagined Amelia would… He had saved her out of duty, believing she needed protection. But now? She wanted the very man who tormented her. All this time, he had been nothing but an unwanted intruder in their twisted game.

The bitter irony twisted his lips into a cold, humorless smile.

The rest of the guests—whether they knew the truth or not—couldn’t muster an ounce of pity for him.

Poor bastard. Stumbling into these two lunatics was the worst luck of his life.

###Chapter 235 The Price of a Loose Tongue

The tension in the penthouse was so thick it could be sliced with a knife. Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers gripping the edge of the marble countertop as she watched the city lights flicker below. The argument with Nathan Blackwood had left her drained, but she refused to back down.

"You can't just walk away from this, Evelyn," Nathan's voice was low, laced with frustration. His usually composed demeanor had cracked, revealing the storm beneath.

She turned to face him, her emerald eyes blazing. "I can, and I will. You don't get to dictate my choices anymore."

Nathan took a step forward, his jaw clenched. "This isn't just about you. The press is already circling. One wrong move, and everything we've built—"

"Everything you've built," she corrected sharply. "I never asked for any of this."

A bitter silence settled between them. The penthouse, once a symbol of their shared success, now felt like a gilded cage.

Across town, Victoria Hayes smirked as she scrolled through the latest tabloid headlines on her phone. Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood: Love on the Rocks? The timing couldn't be more perfect. She had waited years for this moment, and now, the cracks in their relationship were finally widening.

She dialed a familiar number. "It's time," she purred. "Make sure the press gets the rest of the photos."

Meanwhile, Serena Whitmore paced her office, her phone pressed to her ear. "Evelyn, you need to get ahead of this. The media is going to tear you apart if you don't control the narrative."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I don't care what they say."

"You should care," Serena snapped. "Your career is on the line. One scandal, and every brand deal you've worked for could vanish overnight."

Evelyn closed her eyes, the weight of her decisions pressing down on her. She had fought too hard to let it all crumble now.

Back at the penthouse, Nathan's phone buzzed with an incoming call. He glanced at the screen—Julian Blackwood. His brother rarely called unless it was urgent.

Nathan answered tersely. "What is it?"

Julian's voice was grim. "You need to see this. It's all over the internet."

Nathan's blood ran cold as he opened the link Julian had sent. The headline screamed at him: Nathan Blackwood's Secret Affair Exposed—Photos Inside.

His grip on the phone tightened. This wasn't just a scandal—it was a calculated attack. And he had a sinking feeling he knew exactly who was behind it.

Evelyn's phone chimed with a notification. She hesitated before looking, but curiosity won out. The moment she saw the photos, her breath caught in her throat.

Nathan with another woman.

Her heart shattered.

But then, something in the background of one photo caught her eye—a familiar face lurking in the shadows.

Victoria.

Evelyn's shock morphed into cold fury. This wasn't just betrayal—it was sabotage.

And she wasn't going down without a fight.

The nightmare haunting Daniel Wright had become a living torment for the entire Wright family. With numerous relatives from his mother's side gathered for the wedding, the revelation sent shockwaves through them all, sparking outrage in waves.

Who could have imagined that saving someone would lead to such venomous betrayal?

Back in their school days, few had the courage to stand against bullies. Those who truly needed saving still trembled in the shadows. Yet this despicable pair had twisted noble acts into a sick joke.

Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.

Meanwhile, Mason Wright was still toying with Amelia Bennett.

"What's wrong? Still thinking about him?" His voice dripped with mockery.

"No. Mason, please—take me with you. I'm begging you. I know deep down, you want a family. You could be a good father. How can you abandon your own child?"

"Enough." His tone turned icy. "You’ll marry him as planned. Agree to terminate the pregnancy. Make him believe you were forced. And for God’s sake, don’t slip up and reveal the truth."

Evelyn Sinclair smirked to herself. Most men light a cigarette after sex, but these two? They scheme. Still, it made things easier. The baby in Amelia’s belly was already legally registered under Mason’s name—absolutely laughable.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

Could it be true? The child from this rushed marriage wasn’t Daniel’s at all? It belonged to that bastard Mason? The sheer audacity of the Reed family! One brother impregnates the woman, the other marries her? Some twisted sibling teamwork? Victor Reed must be so proud. No family had ever come this close to such disgrace. Or… had they? Maybe they all needed a long, hard look in the mirror. The thought alone sent chills down spines.

Others focused on Daniel’s actions.

From the recording, had Daniel known the child wasn’t his? Believing his fiancée had been violated, he was willing to endure it—as long as she aborted the baby, he’d still take her back? Was he a saint? Tragically, his mercy had been wasted on a viper. That witch had snagged a man too good for her. If he’d been foolish with other women, he’d deserve scorn. But if he’d foolishly chosen me? Oh, I’d have cherished him.

Mixed emotions swirled, but the sharpest minds zeroed in on the real issue—their expressions darkening instantly.

Nathan Blackwood watched Daniel’s face and knew the truth had finally struck home.

Daniel had thought he’d hit rock bottom. But fate had dug him a deeper pit.

This wasn’t some old voice message. This was happening right now.

Amelia and Mason were talking at this very moment.

She was cheating on her own wedding day.

###Chapter 236: The Villain's Undoing

The blow struck Daniel like a physical force, his blood boiling with rage.

It's over.

For a fleeting moment, he wondered—how much must Amelia despise him to do something so cruel?

Or perhaps he had never truly grasped just how vile she could be.

Victor Reed had barely recovered from the shock of his illegitimate son’s exposure. Now, as the reality of the situation sank in, fury nearly sent him crashing to the floor. If not for the butler’s steadying grip, he might have collapsed entirely.

Gritting his teeth, Victor rasped, "Go—find them—"

The butler hesitated, unsure where to even begin. He had to first guide Victor to a chair before rushing to the surveillance room to investigate.

The other guests quickly caught on, their expressions shifting from confusion to scandalized intrigue. Eyes darted around the room, searching for the deceitful couple in hiding. The air buzzed with whispers—no one wanted to miss the moment the schemers were caught red-handed.

After all, when it came to exposing cheaters, participation was half the fun.

Meanwhile, Mason and Amelia remained blissfully unaware. The elegant manor was filled with soft music, even in the secluded restroom where they stood. Their conversation, picked up by the overly sensitive microphone, echoed through the main hall—but the distance muffled the sound for them. They assumed the indistinct murmurs were just the emcee’s voice.

Amelia’s tears fell freely as she clutched Mason’s arm. "How can you be so heartless? Even if you don’t want me, you can’t just abandon our child!"

Mason scoffed. "Why the rush? There’ll be more. And if Daniel’s too busy playing cop to notice, we’ll make sure he raises mine. Every child he thinks is his—will be mine. Even if that old man doesn’t leave the Reed fortune to me, my blood will inherit it all."

Evelyn Sinclair smirked. Do all villains have this compulsive need to gloat? Their downfall always came from their own arrogance. Now, it was truly over. Even if Mason later realized the truth, even if he wept and begged and played the victim—no one would dare defend him.

Nathan Blackwood watched the Reed family’s expressions twist in disgust. Blood ties or not, Mason’s words had sealed his fate. No amount of remorse could undo this.

And honestly—who would want to work with a man like that?

The Reeds would be fools to keep him. And the other families? They’d never risk their reputations by association.

After all, no one wanted to collaborate with a snake.

Game over, Mason.

The revelation that Mason Wright had orchestrated the downfall of his own half-brother sent shockwaves through the room. Even if it had been a minor business dispute, the sheer betrayal would have given anyone pause. The fear of being stabbed in the back with no recourse was palpable.

When Nathan Blackwood heard Mason’s scheme, he was once again confronted with the depths of human depravity. Unlike Daniel Wright, who had nearly been tricked into raising another man’s child, Nathan had been utterly deceived by a woman. He had been oblivious—had he known, he would have put a stop to it immediately.

But the mastermind behind it all was his own half-brother.

The mere thought of what could have happened—had he remained ignorant and stayed with Amelia Bennett—twisted his stomach with nausea.

Sophia Reed, standing nearby, took an unsteady step back. The repulsive man before her was the same one she had once fallen for. The realization that she had been in a relationship with him for months made bile rise in her throat.

The others were equally stunned.

Damn, this bastard is ruthless. He’ll exploit any opening he can find.

To an outsider, it might have seemed like Daniel had committed some unforgivable crime to warrant such cruelty.

The scandal was so explosive that it would make the Reed family the laughingstock of high society.

"So… this was your plan all along," Amelia choked out. "No, I won’t agree to it. If you reject me now, I’ll be a faithful wife to Daniel. I swear I’ll never betray him again."

She struggled to speak, her voice trembling.

The room fell into stunned silence. There was a flicker of something resembling morality in her words—but not enough to be convincing. It was clear she was using it as leverage against Mason.

Evelyn Sinclair smirked inwardly. Oh, how noble of you! Playing the devoted wife to Daniel now? Should he be weeping with gratitude for your sudden change of heart?

Nathan glanced at Daniel, whose fists were clenched so tightly his knuckles had turned white.

The tension in the room was suffocating.

###Chapter 237 I Never Want To See You Again

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathan Blackwood had already left for his early meeting, leaving only the faint trace of his cologne lingering in the air.

She stretched, her muscles protesting slightly from last night’s events—a gala that had ended with whispered threats and stolen glances. The memory sent a shiver down her spine.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant:

"Victoria Hayes just called. She wants to see you at the office ASAP. Says it’s urgent."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, had never been her biggest fan. Whatever this was about, it wouldn’t be pleasant.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek black dress that screamed power—a silent armor against whatever storm awaited her.

The Blackwood Enterprises building loomed ahead, its glass façade reflecting the city’s skyline. As Evelyn stepped into the elevator, her phone buzzed again—this time, an unknown number.

"You should have stayed out of this, Evelyn."

Her breath hitched. No signature, no context. Just a threat.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal Victoria standing by Nathan’s office, arms crossed, a smirk playing on her lips.

“Took you long enough,” Victoria drawled. “Nathan’s waiting.”

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathan never summoned her like this. Something was wrong.

She pushed the door open—only to freeze.

Nathan stood by the window, his back rigid, while Marcus Donovan, Julian Blackwood’s agent, leaned against the desk, a folder in hand.

And inside that folder—photos.

Of her.

With Vincent Holloway.

Nathan turned, his storm-gray eyes dark with betrayal.

“Care to explain?”

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

This wasn’t just a storm.

This was war.

The aftermath of what had just transpired in the bathroom crashed over Amelia like a tidal wave. Her breath hitched as the realization dawned—there had been a microphone planted there the entire time. How much had the guests outside heard? The weight of their stares pressed against her skin, each glance sharper than a blade.

Beside her, Ethan—no, Mason—froze, his face draining of color as his gaze darted around the room. The air between them thickened with dread.

"Pathetic," Evelyn Sinclair murmured under her breath, her lips curling in disdain. "So bold behind closed doors, yet trembling like frightened rabbits now. They knew exactly how disgraceful their actions were."

Nathan Blackwood's voice was ice. "Some people refuse to acknowledge their sins until they're exposed for the world to see."

The whispers around them swelled, morphing into a chorus of condemnation.

"Did you hear what she said? Daniel gave her a choice," one guest sneered. "Any decent person would have walked away, not humiliated him like this."

"Unbelievable," another scoffed. "She was ready to marry him right after leaving another man. What kind of woman lacks even a shred of shame?"

A third voice chimed in, dripping with mock concern. "And she's pregnant. Risking her child for a moment of weakness? Disgusting."

"Amelia? More like Avarice," someone quipped, earning a ripple of laughter.

"Some people are beyond saving," another remarked coldly. "No matter how pitiful they seem, they choose their own ruin. If they suffer, it's what they deserve."

"Stay too close, and their misfortune will stain you too," a woman warned, shaking her head.

A man shuddered dramatically. "First time I've met someone so repulsive. I'll think twice before trusting another innocent-looking face."

"Birds of a feather," another muttered. "That bastard Mason is just as vile. One hit, and he comes running to sabotage a wedding? Pure spite."

"Petty and vindictive," a guest agreed. "Best to steer clear of men like him."

A sharp laugh cut through the murmurs. "I've seen my share of family feuds, but this? Ruthless. Mason Wright is something else."

"Exactly!" another voice rose in outrage. "What did Daniel ever do to him? It's Mason and his mother who wronged Serena and Daniel!"

The room buzzed with judgment, each word another nail in the coffin of Amelia and Mason's reputations.

He would never admit his mistakes.

They were utterly humiliated, stripped of all dignity, left drowning in shame. It was worse than being paraded naked through the streets—their pride had been shattered beyond repair.

"Shut up!" Daniel roared, his face burning with fury and embarrassment. "You conniving witch! This was all your doing! You—"

His rage had no direction now. Every illusion he had clung to had been ripped away, leaving him raw and irrational. He was unraveling before everyone’s eyes, a man who had lost all control.

To the onlookers—Daniel’s former high school classmates—he was no different from the bullies they remembered. Hot-headed, reckless, and now, utterly pathetic. How could Amelia have ever chosen this fool over Grayson?

The answer was simple: bad taste.

Before Daniel could finish his tirade, Grayson struck him. The force sent him spinning, his body twisting mid-air before crashing to the ground.

Grayson’s slap carried far more power than a woman’s. One hit was enough to split Daniel’s lip, sending teeth flying. Before he could even groan, another slap followed, dislocating his jaw.

Daniel tried to scream, but all that came out was a garbled, wet sound. Drool dripped from his mouth as he scrambled backward, eyes wide with terror.

For the first time, he was afraid.

Desperate, he turned to Victor, silently begging for help.

But Victor was already drowning in his own disgrace. He had no energy left to salvage this disaster. All he could think was: Why did I ever stray from my family? What have I done?

Amelia watched, trembling, as Grayson attacked Daniel. She sat frozen on the cold floor, no longer the cherished fiancée Grayson had once adored. There was no gentle hand to pull her up, no worried whisper asking if she was cold.

Her body shook violently, her vision blurring at the edges. The weight of everyone’s stares pressed down on her, suffocating.

She couldn’t bear to remember the sounds she had made—the words she had spoken.

With tears streaming down her face, she turned to Grayson, her voice breaking. "Grayson, I—I didn’t mean to, I swear—"

But the words died in her throat.

Because Grayson wasn’t looking at her.

Not anymore.

Regret coiled inside Amelia like a venomous serpent, tightening its grip with every passing second. She had sworn to herself—to Daniel—that once they were married, she would never betray him. Contacting Ethan had been purely about their child, nothing more. Yet, a few honeyed words had unraveled her resolve, pulling her back into his orbit.

She hadn’t meant for this to happen. Not again. But desire had overridden reason, blurring lines she’d promised never to cross.

This wasn’t me. This wasn’t what I wanted.

Tears streamed down her face as she crumpled to the floor, her voice breaking. "Daniel!" she wailed, the same desperate plea that had always summoned him before.

And just like always, he came.

Her heart fluttered with fragile hope. See? He still cares. He’ll always come for me.

The room erupted in murmurs. Disbelief. Judgment.

"No way," Evelyn Sinclair breathed, her eyes wide.

Nathan Blackwood smirked, unbothered. "Don’t worry. Once he sees the truth, he won’t stay blind."

Amelia barely heard them. Her gaze locked onto Daniel as he knelt before her, his expression unreadable. Fresh tears spilled over—tears of injustice, of betrayal.

But before she could speak, his fingers closed around hers.

And he slid off her engagement ring.

Her breath hitched. "Y-you’re leaving me?" she whispered, voice trembling.

Daniel laughed—a harsh, bitter sound. "Amelia, do you really think I’m that stupid?" His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "You’ve taken enough. Be grateful I don’t believe in hitting women."

A cold dread slithered down her spine. The man before her wasn’t the Daniel she knew. His eyes—once warm, devoted—were glacial.

How?

How could he just… stop loving me?

She didn’t understand. When love soured into disgust, it didn’t fade—it shattered. And in its wake, all that remained was the sickening realization that the woman he’d once adored was nothing but a stranger. A liar.

"Amelia Bennett," Daniel said, rising to his full height, "our engagement is over. From this moment on, you mean nothing to me. Go back to Ethan. Or don’t. I don’t care." His voice hardened. "But you will leave my house tonight. And by tomorrow, I expect you gone from the apartment. Disappear. Because if I ever see your face again, I won’t be responsible for what happens."

The world tilted beneath her.

With a choked sob, she lunged forward, clutching at his pant leg like a beggar. "Daniel, please! You—you saved me! You can’t just throw me away now!" Her voice cracked. "I was going to end it with Ethan! I was going to choose you! We were so close—!"

Daniel didn’t even look at her.

He walked away.

And with every step, Amelia felt her heart splinter into irreparable pieces.

###Chapter 238 A Day for Reckoning, Not Vows

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still foggy from sleep, when an unexpected whisper of thoughts invaded her consciousness.

"Oh my god, did Nathan really say that to Victoria last night?"

Evelyn froze. That wasn’t her own thought. It was… someone else’s.

She sat up abruptly, her heart pounding. The voice—no, the thought—belonged to Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant. But how was she hearing it?

Another snippet floated in, vivid and unguarded. "I can’t believe he’d risk everything for her. If Evelyn finds out—"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Finds out what?

She clutched the sheets, her mind racing. This wasn’t just a fluke. She could hear Lillian’s unfiltered musings, raw and uncensored. And if she could hear Lillian… who else could she listen to?

A slow, dangerous smile curved her lips.

This changed everything.

Downstairs, Nathan Blackwood sipped his coffee, oblivious to the storm brewing above. Across from him, Victoria Hayes—his poised but scheming secretary—leaned forward, her voice honeyed.

"Mr. Blackwood, the board meeting has been moved to ten. Should I prepare the quarterly reports?"

Nathan nodded absently, his mind elsewhere.

Evelyn descended the stairs, her steps light but her gaze sharp. She paused at the doorway, watching them.

And then—she listened.

Victoria’s inner monologue spilled into her mind like ink in water. "If I play this right, I’ll have him wrapped around my finger by the end of the month. Evelyn won’t know what hit her."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palm.

Oh, but she did know now.

And she wasn’t about to let that slide.

At the office, Preston Whitmore—the ambitious director—cornered Donovan Sharpe near the water cooler.

"Did you hear about the new investor?" Preston murmured.

Evelyn, passing by, caught the tail end of his spoken words—but it was the unspoken ones that sent a chill down her spine.

"If this deal goes through, Nathan will owe me. And then… maybe Evelyn won’t be so untouchable."

Her blood ran cold.

They were all plotting.

But she had the upper hand now.

And she intended to use it.

That evening, as Nathan loosened his tie and sighed, Evelyn perched on the arm of his chair, her voice deceptively soft.

"Long day?"

He smiled tiredly. "You have no idea."

Oh, but she did.

Because while he thought she was just his loving wife, she was something far more dangerous now.

A woman who could hear every secret, every lie, every betrayal before it even left their lips.

And she wasn’t afraid to play dirty.

The sharp click of heels echoed through the hall as Daniel was suddenly shoved aside.

A group of women, varying in age and fury, surged forward. Before anyone could react, they descended upon Amelia, their hands flying in a relentless storm of slaps—left, right, left again—until her cheeks burned crimson.

"Shameless creature!" one spat, her voice dripping with venom. "How dare you spew such lies?"

"Your morals are as rotten as your heart," another sneered. "Born deceitful, yet you have the audacity to make promises? If you ever stay faithful, I'll eat my own hat!"

A third woman scoffed, crossing her arms. "What’s this? Weren’t you obsessed with that bastard child not long ago? Now you’re clinging to my nephew like a drowning rat? Finally realized who can actually give you the life you crave? How pathetically transparent."

"Why are you so desperate to latch onto Daniel?" someone else demanded. "Are you a parasite with no self-respect?"

Another voice cut in, sharp as a blade. "Where do you even get the nerve? Thinking someone as tainted as you could ever be worthy of him? Daniel could have any woman he wants—women who aren’t ruined goods. If not for his misplaced kindness, you’d be nothing but a stain on his past."

"Good God, are you delusional?" a shrill voice chimed in. "You think you’re fit to stand beside him?"

"Being his girlfriend would’ve been a blessing earned by your ancestors’ virtue," another woman hissed. "Too bad you were born without an ounce of decency."

These were the women of Serena’s family. With Serena too frail to intervene and Daniel refusing to raise a hand against a woman, it fell to them to deliver justice.

They were careful, though. Amelia was pregnant, and they wouldn’t risk harming the child. So they focused on her pride instead—her face, her dignity. Each slap was precise, meant to humiliate, not to maim.

Every strike was punctuated by a curse, a symphony of scorn that left Amelia sobbing, her pleas lost beneath the cacophony.

The onlookers watched, satisfaction curling their lips. This woman had spewed nothing but nonsense, her stammering excuses grating on their patience. Finally, someone was putting her in her place.

Evelyn flinched at the sharp cracks of skin meeting skin, instinctively shrinking back.

Nathan’s arms wrapped around her, pulling her securely against his chest. She felt the rumble of his laughter before she heard it, his breath warm against her ear as he chuckled.

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Do you think she actually enjoys this? She fell for a man who hits her. Maybe she doesn’t like Daniel because he’s never laid a hand on her."

Nathan’s laughter deepened, the vibration thrumming through her back.

It was only then that Evelyn realized how close they were—his embrace firm, his presence overwhelming. Heat rushed to her cheeks, unbidden, as she registered the warmth of his body against hers.

And for the first time, she didn’t pull away.

I wasn't taking advantage of the moment to feel Nathan's sculpted abs or broad chest. My only concern was avoiding the spray of saliva from those vicious slaps.

Nathan froze momentarily, heat creeping up his neck. But he quickly seized the opportunity, tightening his embrace. The intoxicating warmth and softness of Evelyn in his arms was overwhelming.

Could she feel his racing heartbeat?

The Blackwoods missed their chance to witness the tender moment, assuming Evelyn was merely commenting on the chaotic scene. Their attention remained glued to the spectacle of violence unfolding before them.

After twenty brutal slaps, Amelia's face swelled grotesquely, her mouth drooling uncontrollably. Only then did the women relent.

Yet through tear-filled eyes, Amelia still gazed pleadingly at Daniel.

Daniel's brows furrowed. Recalling how his past kindness had made Amelia mistake him for a pushover filled him with self-directed fury. How could I have been so blind?

"Your masochistic love for your abuser is your business," he spat. "Indulge in your twisted fantasies all you want. But dragging me into your sick game? That's beyond cruel. Amelia, consider our past erased."

Her swollen lips trembling, Amelia finally turned to Mason before collapsing in a sobbing heap.

No one pitied her.

Daniel immediately called an ambulance while ordering staff to pack Amelia's belongings for Mason.

Mason tried storming out, but Daniel's police colleagues and military cousins restrained him until the ambulance arrived. They loaded the unconscious Amelia inside, forcing Mason in after her.

When the nurse hesitantly asked about their relationship, someone quipped, "He's the father of her baby."

Mason thrashed violently, shooting Daniel a venomous glare that promised vengeance.

Daniel didn't bother looking back. From a distance, Sophia watched Mason's true colors emerge, her heart shattering. Overwhelmed with regret for her poor judgment, she nearly collapsed until Margaret and the Blackwoods rushed to comfort her.

Ultimately, Victor went to the hospital, arranged by the distressed Owen. Though Amelia and Daniel were through, she still carried the Reed family's heir—a fact they couldn't ignore.

Once the troublemakers left, Serena approached Daniel. "I had to expose everything publicly," she explained. "If I'd told you privately and you divorced later, people would've crucified our family for abandoning a pregnant woman. I couldn't let them paint you as the villain when she's the one who betrayed you."

The words struck Daniel like a physical blow. His mother, Serena Collins, gripped his arm with surprising strength, her voice barely above a whisper yet laced with steel.

"They abandoned you. They're the ones who wronged you. What does embarrassment matter when the truth is laid bare? When your name is cleared, you'll find a woman worthy of you."

Daniel's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Thank you, Mother. For seeing what I couldn't." He exhaled sharply. "But let's not pretend I'm blameless. I was a fool, and I deserve every ounce of shame. And if we stay silent—" His jaw tightened. "That bastard will slither back into the Reed family like nothing happened. They'll bury the truth to protect their precious reputation. I won't let him walk away unscathed after what he did to you."

Serena's face was pale, her eyes shadowed with exhaustion, yet she still fought for him. The sight carved a fresh wound in Daniel's chest.

"Mother," he murmured, squeezing her hand. "I failed you. I know you're hurting more than I am. Don't hold back—do what you need to do. I'm with you." He knew her too well. She wouldn't break quietly.

The guests watched, oblivious to their hushed exchange, as Daniel gave a single, firm nod.

Victor Reed hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. This spectacle needed to end. The wedding was off; the guests should leave. But before he could intervene, Serena turned to the crowd, her voice slicing through the murmurs like a blade.

"Since you're all here," she announced, her bloodshot eyes locking onto Victor, "allow me to make an announcement."

Victor paled. He knew that tone. He lunged forward—only for Daniel to step smoothly into his path.

"You—!" Victor snarled.

Daniel didn't flinch. He simply lowered his gaze, silent as a sentinel.

Serena's voice rang out, clear and unshaken. "Victor Reed, as of today, I, Serena Collins, am filing for divorce. My lawyers will contact you tomorrow." A collective gasp rippled through the room. "Every cent you spent on your mistress and that bastard son of yours—I will reclaim it. Every asset, every hidden account, every penny that belongs to me." Her smile was glacial. "And this house? It's in my name. Get out."

Victor's face drained of color.

The guests stood frozen, their shock palpable.

What in the world...?

This wasn't a wedding.

This was a bloodbath.

And it was glorious.

###Chapter 239 No Need To Fear The Rumor Mill
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sat curled up on her plush velvet sofa, a steaming cup of Earl Grey in hand, her gaze fixed on the tabloid spread across the coffee table. The headline screamed in bold letters: "Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the porcelain cup. She hadn’t expected to stumble upon this particular piece of gossip while skimming through the morning news. The accompanying photo showed Nathan, impeccably dressed in a tailored navy suit, his arm draped casually around a stunning brunette in a sequined red dress. The woman’s face was partially obscured, but Evelyn didn’t need to see it clearly to recognize the possessive glint in Nathan’s eyes.

"Interesting," she mused, her lips quirking into a smirk.

Just then, her phone buzzed. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, popped up:

"You’ve got a meeting with Preston Whitmore in an hour. Also, Donovan Sharpe called—wants to discuss the script revisions. And… you might want to check your social media. Things are getting spicy."

Evelyn arched a brow. Spicy? She swiped open her Instagram, and within seconds, her screen flooded with tagged posts and comments. The same photo from the tabloid had gone viral, with fans and gossip accounts dissecting every pixel.

@GossipQueen: "Is Nathan Blackwood finally moving on from Evelyn Sinclair? 👀 #DramaAlert"

@SinclairSquad: "Excuse me? That’s clearly a business dinner. Stop reaching."

@BlackwoodBabe: "Sorry, Evelyn, but he looks way happier with her. Just saying."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Pathetic," she muttered under her breath.

But then—her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a direct message from an unknown number.

"You should ask him about Vienna. He’s not as loyal as you think."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Vienna?

A slow, dangerous smile curled her lips. Whoever this mystery woman was, she’d just made things infinitely more entertaining.

And Evelyn loved a good game.

Serena Collins' bombshell divorce announcement sent shockwaves through the Reed and Collins families.

The Collins clan, renowned for their unwavering principles, immediately rallied behind their daughter when she made her stance clear—especially since Daniel Wright didn't object.

The Reeds, however, panicked. In the cutthroat world of business, their acumen was mediocre at best. Their connections—largely thanks to the Collins family’s military ties—had been their lifeline. Without that leverage, the Reeds would never have climbed to their current status.

They didn’t have a prodigy like Nathan Blackwood, who could single-handedly salvage a sinking empire.

Severing ties with the Collins family? Unthinkable.

Desperate, they resorted to tired excuses and hollow apologies.

After all, in their circles, mistresses and illegitimate children were hardly scandalous. Some even considered Victor Reed respectable—he’d only kept one mistress and fathered one illegitimate child. By elite standards, that was practically monastic.

Let’s be honest—among the guests present, three out of five men had strayed from their vows.

In high society, marital fidelity was the exception, not the rule.

That said, few bastards caused this level of uproar. Serena’s fury was justified, and her decision to divorce? Understandable.

So the Reeds pushed Victor forward, demanding he grovel—even if it meant humiliating himself in front of everyone—to win Serena back.

But Serena’s mind was made up. She ignored their pleas, summoning her family’s soldiers and her son’s police colleagues to escort them out.

Humiliated, the Reeds had no choice but to leave.

Victor and his butler were unceremoniously ejected, his phone buzzing relentlessly.

Through Evelyn Sinclair’s sharp intuition, the Blackwoods knew exactly who was calling—the mistress overseas.

Ethan Carter had tattled, and the mistress still held emotional leverage over Victor. Now, every vibration of his phone made him want to hurl it against the wall.

The guests bit back laughter at his pathetic state.

With the nuisance gone, the hosts smoothly guided the remaining guests toward the exit.

Serena and Daniel personally apologized to each attendee.

As they departed, whispers of the scandal already rippled through the crowd.

High society was in for another seismic shift—though Evelyn likely didn’t anticipate being dragged into the drama again.

The whispers spread like wildfire through the gilded halls of the venue.

"Apparently, Daniel found the surveillance footage first, and then Serena got suspicious after seeing it. She caught them red-handed."

"Daniel didn’t suspect anything before, did he? Why would he investigate Amelia?"

"Someone must have tipped him off. He seemed completely normal before the wedding."

"Come to think of it, I’ve seen Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood with Daniel quite often lately…"

"You mean Nathan and that—"

"Yes, her."

"Why is she involved again? She was present during the Locke family scandal too, and she was close to the key players."

"Must be a coincidence. They’re Nathan’s friends, after all. Naturally, they’d be here."

"No, no, the Scandal Whisperer knows things."

"So, if you attend events with her, you’re guaranteed front-row seats to high-society drama?"

"You think Mrs. Blackwood is some kind of walking bad luck charm? Wherever she goes, chaos follows?"

"Honestly, I just want to know which event she’s attending next. Watching scandals unfold in real time is thrilling."

"As long as she doesn’t show up at my family’s events, I’m fine. I’d be terrified."

"If you’ve got nothing to hide, why fear the Scandal Magnet? Unless your—"

"Shut up."

Just as Evelyn was about to leave, she felt the weight of dozens of eyes boring into her, prickling her skin with unease.

At that moment, Nathan’s friends couldn’t hold back their amusement.

Grayson frowned. "Evelyn, be honest—is there some kind of supernatural force around you?"

He was starting to wonder if his disastrous luck with Gwendolyn was somehow tied to Evelyn, given that Gwendolyn was her fan.

Not that he cared about Gwendolyn, but her refusal to play along was irritating. She was just a stand-in, after all. She should’ve been obedient. Even if she was unhappy, he couldn’t give her what she wanted. The fact that he allowed her to stay by his side should’ve been enough.

Evelyn didn’t have time to decipher Grayson’s twisted logic—if she had, she would’ve laughed in his face.

"This time, it was Nathan who uncovered the truth, not me," she said quickly, deflecting the blame.

Nathan nodded in agreement, his expression unreadable.

The whispers only grew louder.

"Didn't you just want to see a dog and ended up uncovering an illegitimate child scandal?" Vivian Grant burst into laughter, her eyes twinkling with amusement.

The group didn't overanalyze like Grayson Hart had. Instead, they simply marveled at Evelyn Sinclair’s uncanny ability to stumble upon the juiciest gossip and teased her about it.

Normally, they wouldn’t be so lighthearted when their close friend Daniel Wright was going through such turmoil. But in this case, the revelation was actually beneficial for him. Besides, after the whole Mason Hunter and Claire Morgan fiasco, they had become somewhat desensitized to drama—now, they just enjoyed the show.

"Do you two break up a couple at every event you attend?" Marcus Prescott immediately turned to Beatrice Holloway with a smirk. "Beatrice, watch out. Your engagement party is next."

Beatrice shrugged, completely unfazed. "If a couple can be broken up that easily, they had problems to begin with. It’s better to find out early than to suffer later. But honestly, I’m not worried. Ours is a loveless, arranged marriage. He’s a notorious playboy, and we’re just cooperating for appearances."

It was the first time Beatrice had openly spoken about her upcoming marriage.

Evelyn had known about it before—it was purely a business arrangement, with both parties free to do as they pleased. Beatrice didn’t indulge in affairs, but her fiancé certainly did. With no emotions involved, there was no room for hurt feelings.

Every time Beatrice spoke, Evelyn couldn’t help but glance at Lucas Thornton’s reaction.

It was impossible to suppress her inner gossip queen, especially when she knew someone in their circle harbored secret feelings for another—feelings that remained unnoticed by everyone else.

As expected, Lucas’s expression flickered with something unreadable before he quickly masked it with a teasing grin, turning the attention back to Marcus. "Why don’t you mention your father’s upcoming wedding instead?"

Marcus immediately turned to Evelyn with a dramatic plea. "You have to come and ruin my dad’s wedding."

Vivian playfully smacked his arm.

Marcus pouted. "You wouldn’t want your future mother-in-law to be the same age as you, would you?"

One could only say that Marcus’s father changed wives more often than most people changed their phones. It had gotten to the point where Marcus suspected his father was just collecting wedding gifts at this rate.

Each new marriage caused chaos at home, driving Marcus to stay abroad longer. Several times, he and Vivian had planned to return and finally tie the knot, only to be thwarted by his father’s latest romantic escapade. The only silver lining? His father couldn’t father any more illegitimate children—likely due to physical limitations.

They had been laughing and chatting for a while when Daniel finally arrived. Among close friends, he didn’t bother hiding his exhaustion—it was written all over his face.

###Chapter 240 Mason Will Not Give Up

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her latte, scrolling through her phone absently, when an unexpected wave of thoughts crashed into her mind.

"Oh my god, did you hear? Nathan Blackwood was seen leaving a hotel with that new actress, Seraphina Delacroix, at 3 AM last night!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. That wasn’t her thought—it was someone else’s. And not just anyone. That voice belonged to Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s scheming secretary.

Her fingers tightened around her cup. Since when could she hear Victoria’s thoughts?

More whispers trickled in, sharp and venomous. "Honestly, Evelyn doesn’t deserve him. She’s just a washed-up writer clinging to his fame. If only he’d open his eyes and see who’s really been by his side all these years..."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. Oh, Victoria. You have no idea what you’ve just unleashed.

She set her cup down with deliberate calm. If Victoria wanted to play mind games, she’d soon learn Evelyn was the grandmaster.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan Blackwood strode into his office, his expression unreadable. His assistant, Lillian Graves, handed him a tablet. "The board meeting starts in ten, sir. Also, Ms. Hayes has been asking for you all morning."

Nathan barely glanced at the schedule. "Tell her I’m busy."

Lillian hesitated. "She mentioned it was... urgent."

A flicker of irritation crossed his face. "Unless the building’s on fire, it can wait."

As he turned away, a stray thought—sharp and unexpected—pierced his focus. "God, he’s even hotter when he’s pissed. If only Evelyn would just disappear..."

Nathan froze. That wasn’t Lillian’s voice. It was Victoria’s.

And he’d heard it.

His jaw clenched. What the hell is going on?

Back in her penthouse, Evelyn smirked as she tapped out a text to her agent, Serena Whitmore: "Cancel my afternoon. I have a snake to handle."

Victoria wanted to play dirty?

Game on.

"We'll drink with you," Lucas said without hesitation.

The others quickly agreed, all eager to help Daniel unwind.

"I'm fine. I need to stay with my mom and handle things during this time," Daniel replied, his voice steady but his knuckles white from gripping the edge of the table. He was holding himself together—barely. He had always been the strong one, the rock of the family, and now was no different.

He had come specifically to thank Nathan and Evelyn.

If it weren’t for them, he wouldn’t have known how his life would have spiraled.

"It’s because of you two—"

Suddenly, Sophia’s voice cut through the air. The Blackwood family had brought her along to call Nathan and Evelyn home.

As elders who knew Sophia, they couldn’t let her return alone, so they insisted on escorting her.

Sophia’s face was still pale, but hearing Daniel’s words reminded her of her own fate. She dipped her head slightly in gratitude toward Nathan and Evelyn.

When she lifted her gaze, she accidentally locked eyes with Daniel.

Both immediately looked away, an unspoken tension thickening the air between them.

Their connection was strange—a mix of guilt and resentment. They were both victims of the same cruel deception, yet neither knew how to face the other. The weight of their shared betrayal made every glance, every word, unbearably awkward.

But to everyone else watching, there was something almost... poetic about the two of them standing there. Two people who had been wronged in the worst way, now bound by circumstance. For a fleeting moment, some even entertained the absurd thought of matching them together.

But that idea vanished as quickly as it came.

Attractive people with a perfect height difference could make anyone’s imagination run wild.

Once rationality returned, it was clear—there was no future between them. Not unless fate decided to play another cruel joke.

After a brief, stilted exchange, the Blackwood family left with Sophia.

In the car, they avoided mentioning the scumbag who had ruined their lives. Instead, they focused on Sophia’s situation.

Her mother was in jail. Her father was overseas, handling business. So, Sophia split her time between her own home and her grandparents’.

News traveled fast. Sophia had wanted to go home to process everything, but the calls wouldn’t stop. In the end, her family decided it was best for her to stay with her grandparents.

Compared to the Fords’ scandal, Sophia’s story was less sensational. When the news spread, the spotlight remained firmly on Daniel, Mason, and Amelia’s twisted love triangle—not to mention the explosive divorce battle between Victor and Serena.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair had earned the nickname "Gossip Empress" in fan circles, spreading like wildfire across the internet. Netizens joked that after cleaning up the entertainment industry, she had turned her attention to high society, bringing justice and moral clarity wherever she went.

Some even tagged her in posts, listing off scandal-ridden families and asking if their drama was real or just manufactured for online clout. Evelyn had unwittingly become their inside source for all things elite.

The situation escalated to the point where Isabelle Laurent called, demanding to know what was happening and whether Evelyn was crafting some new public persona.

Evelyn could only sigh in exasperation.

The day after the incident, the Reed family's meltdown remained the hottest topic online, even trending on short-form video platforms. The storyline was more gripping than a soap opera, and the public couldn't get enough.

But by the third day, the buzz began to fade. Thanks to Serena Collins' powerful connections and Daniel Wright's law enforcement background, the narrative was quickly brought under control.

On the fourth day, Victor Reed and Serena finalized their divorce. Victor, as the guilty party, walked away with almost nothing.

The Reed family blamed Victor for mishandling the situation and costing them dearly. They cut all ties with him, leaving him so furious that he ended up hospitalized.

Serena, ruthless as ever, froze all of the mistress's overseas assets, forcing her to crawl back to Victor and Mason.

The Blackwood family sat in their living room, pretending to discuss idle gossip while secretly hanging onto Evelyn's every update.

Impressive. She moves fast and leaves no room for mercy.

Mason ignored his father's hospitalization and Amelia entirely. He holed up alone in a hotel, lashing out daily. To make matters worse, he was stuck getting a dental crown.

The eavesdropping Blackwoods nearly choked on their laughter.

Amelia, meanwhile, was so distraught that she suffered complications with her pregnancy and had to be hospitalized. Unable to reach Mason, she returned to the penthouse she had shared with Daniel—only to find she couldn’t even enter the building. Daniel had sold the place and wiped her residency from the records, leaving only her belongings with the doorman.

Amelia cried herself into unconsciousness and was rushed back to the hospital.

The Blackwoods scoffed. She actually had the nerve to try going back. The audacity!

Amelia then went to Daniel's workplace, only to learn he was on leave. She showed up at his mansion, but it was empty.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Seems like Serena and Daniel have seen right through her. If they can’t deal with her, they’ll just avoid her.

Outside, Amelia ran into Mason’s mother, who had come to fight for her son’s share of the assets.

The Blackwoods smirked. Birds of a feather. The two most important women in Mason’s life have come to the same conclusion.

Amelia, naturally, latched onto her, desperate to find Mason.

Seriously. She’s not giving up on either side.

The Blackwood family was stunned into silence.

They ended up in a vicious argument. Mason’s mother lashed out at Amelia, blaming her for bringing misfortune upon them. If it weren’t for Amelia, her son wouldn’t have lost his status, and they wouldn’t be in this mess. She even called Amelia a curse. In her fury, she struck Amelia—

What? The baby is gone?

The Blackwoods were horrified. They had imagined countless scenarios, but never this—Mason’s own mother had beaten Amelia so severely that she lost the child. It was her own grandchild!

Then again, perhaps the greatest tragedy would have been for that child to be born into such a family. With parents so morally bankrupt, maybe it was a mercy. The heavens had spared the innocent soul from a lifetime of suffering.

The next day, Evelyn brought more updates.

Mason finally reappeared after getting his dental work done. Faced with Amelia’s hysterical grief over their lost child, he remained cold and detached. He warned her never to contact him again, declaring her worthless and their relationship over. Amelia finally saw the truth.

The Blackwoods were disgusted. What kind of monster abandons his own child?

Oh my God—Amelia is trying to jump off a building! Evelyn gasped.

The Blackwoods froze in shock.

Wait—was this just another act? Another desperate ploy to force Daniel to show up? She had deliberately left Daniel’s contact information with the nurses, claiming to be his ex-girlfriend. Unbelievable.

The Blackwoods were speechless, morbidly curious about how this would end.

The next second, Evelyn was shaking with suppressed laughter, barely able to stay seated. She collapsed against Nathan’s shoulder, wheezing with amusement.

The hospital had safeguards against people like her. The rooftop door was locked. She couldn’t even get up there to stage her dramatic exit. And because she had left Daniel’s details, the nurses noticed her heading for the roof. Security was called, and her suicide attempt failed spectacularly. The hospital suspected mental instability and sent her for a psychiatric evaluation.

In the end, Daniel never came. Instead, one of Amelia’s distant, unlucky relatives had to deal with the mess. Hahaha—I can’t breathe!

The Blackwoods quickly found other things to do. Aside from Nathan, who could resist laughing at such a ridiculous spectacle? They had to leave the room to let it all out.

Another day passed.

Everyone assumed the drama was finally over.

Then Evelyn suddenly sat up straight, her expression darkening.

What now?

Mason still hadn’t given up. He was determined to win Sophia back. He hadn’t cared about Amelia losing the baby because he wanted to marry into the Reed fortune. An illegitimate child would only complicate things.

The Blackwoods tensed. Margaret immediately wanted to warn Sophia, but it was already too late.

Damn it.

Mason had secretly installed a tracker on Sophia’s phone. Tonight, she had gone to a bar alone to drink—and Mason—

The moment was ripe. He slipped something into her drink and whisked her away to a secluded hotel suite!

Panic erupted in the Blackwood household. Margaret sprang into action, her face pale with dread.

Nathan immediately dialed Daniel, convinced the authorities could intervene swiftly.

"Daniel is already on the scene?"

The room fell silent. All eyes turned to Evelyn, brimming with confusion and thinly veiled suspicion.

What exactly was happening?

The air in the penthouse was thick with tension. Evelyn's fingers trembled around her phone as she replayed the last few hours in her mind. The gala had been a trap—one she'd walked into blindly.

Margaret's voice cut through the silence. "We need to move now." Her tone left no room for argument.

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Daniel's team is en route, but we can't rely solely on them." His gaze flicked to Evelyn, dark with unspoken questions.

Sophia, usually composed, paced the length of the room. "Who would dare target her like this?"

Julian, ever the strategist, leaned forward. "This wasn’t impulsive. Someone planned it meticulously."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. The pieces were there—the lingering stares, the too-convenient timing—but the full picture eluded her.

Then her phone buzzed. An unknown number.

A single sentence lit up the screen:

"You should’ve stayed gone."

Outside the hotel, Daniel’s team moved like shadows. The opulent lobby, usually alive with chatter, was eerily still.

"Room 3402," Daniel murmured into his comms. "Suspect is armed. Proceed with extreme caution."

His men nodded, fanning out with practiced precision.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn’s breath hitched. The message wasn’t just a threat—it was a confession.

Someone from her past had resurfaced.

And they weren’t playing games.

Nathan’s phone rang. Daniel’s voice was tight. "We’ve secured the room. But—"

A beat of silence.

"He’s gone. Vanished. Left behind... something for Evelyn."

Nathan’s blood ran cold. "What is it?"

Daniel exhaled sharply.

"A necklace. The same one Cassandra wore the night she disappeared."

The line went dead.

Nathan’s hands shook.

This wasn’t just an attack.

It was a declaration of war.

Evelyn met his gaze, the unspoken truth hanging between them.

Whoever did this knew everything.

And they weren’t .

Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 241 A Wolf in Gentleman's Clothing
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her vanilla latte, scrolling through her phone absentmindedly—until a particular headline caught her eye.

"Seraphina Delacroix Spotted Leaving Sebastian Hart’s Penthouse at Dawn—Is Their On-Again, Off-Again Romance Heating Up Again?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Seraphina, the notoriously dramatic actress, and Sebastian, her equally volatile ex? This was juicy.

Her fingers flew across the screen, pulling up the accompanying photos. There was Seraphina, wrapped in nothing but a silk robe, her dark hair tousled, slipping into a waiting car. The timestamp? 4:37 AM.

Evelyn smirked. Oh, this is going to be good.

Just then, her phone buzzed with a text from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Lillian: You seeing this?

Evelyn: Oh, I’m seeing it. And I’m already drafting the mental screenplay.

Because here was the thing about Evelyn Sinclair—she didn’t just read gossip. She lived for it. The drama, the betrayals, the whispered scandals in gilded hallways—it all fueled her creativity. As a bestselling romance novelist, she thrived on the messy, unpredictable chaos of real-life relationships.

And Seraphina Delacroix? She was chaos incarnate.

Evelyn tapped her nails against her phone case, already imagining the fallout. Would Sebastian’s current girlfriend, Adrian Cross, find out? Would Seraphina’s manager, Isabelle Laurent, issue another frantic denial? Or—her lips curled—would this finally be the scandal that toppled Seraphina’s carefully curated "reformed party girl" image?

A knock at her door interrupted her scheming.

Nathan Blackwood stood in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate, his dark eyes amused. "You look like you’re plotting something."

Evelyn grinned. "Just enjoying the morning news."

Nathan arched a brow, stepping inside. "Let me guess—Seraphina Delacroix?"

"How did you—?"

"Lillian texted me too. Said you’d need someone to ‘rein in your chaotic energy’ before you accidentally start a Twitter war."

Evelyn scoffed. "Please. I have standards."

Nathan leaned against her desk, arms crossed. "You also have a deadline."

She groaned. "Don’t remind me."

But as Nathan launched into a lecture about her overdue manuscript, Evelyn’s mind wandered back to Seraphina’s scandal. Because if there was one thing she knew, it was this:

In Hollywood, the juiciest stories were never just about who slept with whom.

They were about who got caught.

And Evelyn had a front-row seat to the show.

Sophia Reed had never imagined her judgment could fail so spectacularly. What kind of monster had she entangled herself with?

Raised by a mother whose love was conditional at best, Sophia endured a childhood of emotional neglect and a strained relationship with her parents. Outwardly, she appeared cold and detached, but beneath that icy exterior lay a heart that yearned for genuine affection—though her guarded nature made her wary of letting anyone in.

Her preference for routine and predictability made her seem rigid and uninteresting in Mason Wright’s eyes.

When Mason first pursued her, he had been relentless. Gentle, attentive, utterly devoted—every gesture, every word meticulously crafted to make her feel like the center of his world. Any woman would have fallen for such an illusion.

But that was the danger of comfort. When someone mirrored her perfectly, when every interaction felt effortless, she should have known it was all a performance—a game played by someone far more skilled than her.

Sophia had no experience with love’s darker deceptions. She had been completely fooled.

She thought the humiliation would end with their breakup. With no close friends to turn to and her family’s suffocating expectations weighing on her, she found herself drowning her sorrows alone at a dimly lit bar. Normally, she could hold her liquor, but tonight, a single drink left her head spinning.

Then Mason appeared.

His grip on her wrist was firm, his smile deceptively gentle as he murmured, "Let me take you home."

Panic flared. She tried to scream, but the noise of the crowd swallowed her voice. Her limbs felt heavy, sluggish. Before she could react, his hand clamped over her mouth, and he dragged her out.

The hotel room door clicked shut behind them.

Mason tossed her onto the bed, his expression twisting into something unrecognizable—something predatory.

"What are you doing? Get out!" Sophia’s voice trembled with fury, but her body betrayed her, heat spreading beneath her skin despite her terror.

He laughed, stripping off his jacket with deliberate slowness. "You played the untouchable ice queen so well. But tonight, I’ll make you beg."

Her face paled, then flushed violently. Tears burned her eyes.

"Mason, you bastard! I swear, I’ll ruin you!"

"Oh?" He smirked, stepping aside. Her gaze followed—and her blood turned to ice.

A camera.

Its red light blinked mockingly from the nightstand.

Sophia’s entire body shook. A sob tore from her throat as she hurled every curse she knew at him.

"Save your breath," Mason purred, leaning over her. "After tonight, you’ll marry me. That video? Just a private keepsake between husband and wife. Unless… you’d rather the whole world see it?"

His whisper slithered into her ear like poison.

Sophia clenched her jaw so hard she tasted blood.

This wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

Sophia watched in despair as Mason slithered onto the bed, his movements serpentine, predatory. Every inch of her screamed to fight, to tear him apart—yet her traitorous body burned with an unbearable heat, craving his touch. The self-loathing was suffocating.

Just as Mason’s fingers grazed her collar, threatening to shatter the last of her dignity, the sharp click of the door echoed through the room.

Mason barely had time to turn before a towering figure stormed in like a hurricane.

BAM!

The force of the punch sent Mason crashing to the floor, blood already blooming across his face. His dazed eyes widened in recognition.

"Daniel? You—"

Another brutal strike silenced him. Within moments, Mason lay unconscious, a broken mess at Daniel’s feet.

Daniel had been watching Mason for weeks. His half-brother was a viper, always scheming in the shadows. With Mason’s foreign status, deportation was the safest solution—but Daniel needed proof. He never expected to uncover Mason’s involvement in illegal drugs. The moment he realized Mason was targeting Sophia, he moved.

"Pathetic bastard," Daniel muttered before turning to Sophia.

The second their eyes met, she lunged.

Her arms locked around his neck, her feverish lips crashing against his. The sheer desperation in her kiss left him frozen.

Sophia’s clothes were disheveled, her breathing ragged. She clawed at his shirt, her fingers trembling as she tried to undo the buttons.

"Sophia—stop." Daniel gripped her wrists, forcing space between them.

But her strength was unnatural, fueled by whatever poison Mason had given her. With a desperate shove, she pinned him onto the bed.

"Help me," she begged, her voice raw.

"Do you even know who I am?"

"Daniel," she gasped. "You’re good. You’ll help me."

Her hands roamed his chest, his abdomen, igniting a fire he couldn’t control. Sophia—soft, intoxicating, her scent wrapping around him—was unraveling every shred of his restraint.

And for the first time in his life, Daniel Wright, the disciplined heir of the Ford family, lost control.

His hands tangled in her hair as he kissed her back, hard.

The line between savior and sinner had never been so dangerously thin.

"Sophia! Are you really going to throw yourself at him like this? Snap out of it!"

Sophia froze, her tear-filled eyes locking onto Daniel’s face.

Daniel thought she had finally come to her senses, his cheeks flushing as he tried to gently push her away. But before he could, Sophia wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him again—harder this time.

"I just wanted something real," she whispered against his lips, her voice trembling. "But they had to ruin even that. Fine. If they want to play dirty, then so will I. This isn’t you taking advantage of me—it’s me choosing you. And don’t worry, I won’t hold you accountable."

Her words were reckless, desperate, as if she had given up fighting the effects of the drug coursing through her veins.

Daniel’s breath hitched at the raw determination in her gaze. But before Sophia could tug at his shirt, his hand shot out—

Thud.

She crumpled into his arms, unconscious.

Daniel exhaled sharply, carefully adjusting her disheveled clothes before immediately dialing for an ambulance and the police. Within minutes, Sophia was whisked away to the hospital, while the perpetrator was hauled off in handcuffs.

Now that’s what I call a true gentleman.

As Evelyn’s live broadcast played in the background, the Blackwoods collectively held their breath. When they heard Daniel hadn’t taken advantage of the situation, relief washed over them.

In circumstances like these, anything less would have been unforgivable. Thankfully, Nathan’s friend had proven himself honorable.

Nathan wasn’t surprised in the slightest. Even if Daniel had been drugged, he knew his friend would never cross that line.

I can’t wait to see how these two navigate things after this kind of encounter.

Evelyn’s voice dripped with playful intrigue, her gossip-loving side unable to resist.

###Chapter 242 The Unexpected Pool Party

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse. She stretched lazily, her mind still half-asleep, when suddenly—bam!—a flood of thoughts that weren’t her own crashed into her consciousness.

"Oh my god, did Nathan Blackwood really say that to Victoria Hayes last night?"

Evelyn bolted upright, nearly spilling her coffee. That voice—sharp, gossipy, unmistakably Victoria’s—was crystal clear in her head. But Victoria wasn’t even in the room.

She blinked. Wait… am I hearing her thoughts?

A slow smirk curled her lips. This was gold.

Downstairs in the Blackwood Enterprises lobby, Victoria Hayes adjusted her blazer, her mind racing. "Ugh, Nathan’s been so distant lately. Is it because of Evelyn? That woman is insufferable. But if he thinks I’ll just step aside—"

Evelyn, casually sipping her latte nearby, nearly choked. Oh, this is too good.

She leaned against the reception desk, feigning interest in her phone while tuning into Victoria’s mental monologue.

"Maybe I should ‘accidentally’ bump into him at the gala tonight. Wear that red dress he likes. Though, honestly, if he’s still hung up on Evelyn, maybe I should just—"

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her cup. Red dress? Gala?

Her phone buzzed. A text from Nathan: "Dinner tonight? 8 PM. Wear something stunning."

Her heart skipped, but then—Victoria’s smug inner voice cut in: "Perfect. The gala starts at 7:30. He’ll have to cancel on her."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. Oh, it’s on.

By noon, she’d “conveniently” run into Preston Whitmore, the director Nathan was meeting before the gala.

“Preston!” She flashed her brightest smile. “You’re still coming to the charity auction tomorrow, right?”

Preston blinked. “Auction? I thought that was next week—”

“Oh no, it’s definitely tomorrow,” Evelyn said smoothly, planting the seed. “Nathan mentioned it this morning.”

Two hours later, Preston’s rescheduled meeting forced Nathan to push dinner to 9 PM—after the gala.

Victoria’s mental scream when she found out? Priceless.

That evening, Evelyn slipped into a sleek black gown—not red—and smirked at her reflection.

Nathan’s text came through: "Running late. Meet you at 9?"

She typed back: "Take your time. I’ll be the one turning heads."

Then, just because she could, she tuned into Victoria’s thoughts one last time.

"Why is he late?! Ugh, this dress is wasted on—wait, is that… Evelyn?!"

Evelyn sauntered into the gala, catching Nathan’s gaze from across the room. His lips parted, his thoughts a delicious, unfiltered mess in her mind.

"Damn. She’s breathtaking."

Victoria’s mental screech? The cherry on top.

Evelyn sipped her champagne, grinning. This mind-reading thing? Best. Power. Ever.

Two hours later, Sophia Reed stirred awake. The first thing she saw was Daniel Wright’s concerned gaze fixed on her. As the fog of her memories cleared, heat rushed to her cheeks, and she yanked the blanket over her face.

She remembered the reckless plea she had made to Daniel. The drugs had played their part, but she hadn’t been entirely out of her mind. If it had been Mason Wright, she would’ve fought tooth and nail. But with Daniel… she had let herself surrender.

"Sophia, are you okay?" Daniel’s voice was awkward, muffled by the covers.

She burrowed deeper, like a flustered rabbit, before mumbling, "I’m sorry."

His own cheeks tinged pink as he reassured her. "Don’t apologize. None of this was your fault. Mason was the one who drugged you."

"Thank you for saving me," Sophia murmured, lowering the blanket just enough to feign composure.

But when their eyes met, the tension from earlier crackled between them again. And there it was—the faint mark on Daniel’s lower lip where she had bitten him in her desperation.

One second later, Sophia vanished beneath the sheets while Daniel spun around, hastily gathering scattered documents and stacking them on the nightstand.

Clearing his throat, he said, "About Mason’s crimes—I have proof of his drug purchase and can testify. But to ensure a full conviction, we’ll need the security footage as evidence. The choice is yours. If you want the video destroyed, I’ll respect that."

Sophia emerged, her face pale but her eyes dark with resolve. "I want him prosecuted. I’ll provide whatever evidence is needed. He deserves to pay for what he did."

Her voice trembled as she hugged herself, her body shaking.

Daniel frowned and stepped closer, resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "You’re not alone in this. I’ll stand with you."

Two victims, united against a predator.

"Th-thank you," Sophia whispered, lifting her gaze—only for both of them to immediately look away, cheeks burning.

Later, the Reed family arrived, joining Daniel in handling the legal proceedings.

Days passed, and news broke—Mason had been sentenced to prison, with deportation awaiting him after his term. Additional charges might follow abroad, but one thing was certain: he wouldn’t escape justice.

A week later, the storm surrounding the Reed family finally quieted.

With no further updates from Daniel and Sophia, Evelyn Sinclair lost interest in the gossip.

Evelyn Sinclair arrived at Blackwood Enterprises with a box of homemade pastries prepared by Margaret. She had every intention of delivering them personally to Nathan Blackwood.

Earlier, Sophia and Lillian had gossiped relentlessly about a stunning businesswoman who had been shamelessly pursuing Nathan. Not that Evelyn cared—she wasn’t here to stake her claim as the official wife. No, she was just… curious.

The moment she stepped into the lobby, the receptionists’ eyes flickered with poorly concealed intrigue. Their exchanged glances screamed scandal, though they still offered her the same polite deference as always.

As she passed Nathan’s office on her way to the CEO’s suite, the assistants stiffened, their gazes darting nervously between her and the closed door. The implication was obvious.

Ah. So the homewrecker is inside? Perfect timing.

Evelyn, ever the picture of grace, instructed the nearest assistant to announce her arrival.

The woman blinked in surprise. “Mr. Blackwood left strict instructions—you’re to go in whenever you please.”

Evelyn’s lips twitched, warmth creeping into her cheeks. Just as she raised her hand to knock, voices spilled through the door.

“I’ve assigned a board member to host your team. I have dinner with my wife every evening and don’t indulge in unnecessary socializing. If you consider this disrespectful, we can terminate our collaboration.”

A woman’s voice, honeyed and deliberate, replied, “Mr. Blackwood, you’re far too clever not to understand my intentions.” The suggestive lilt in her tone was unmistakable.

“After stepping into this office, you still haven’t gotten the message?”

“That ring is just for show.”

Evelyn’s brows shot up.

What in the world are they talking about?

A beat of silence. Then the woman pressed on, “Nathan, I genuinely admire you. I don’t expect anything official—I just want—”

“Let me make this clear.” Nathan’s voice turned razor-sharp. “There isn’t a woman in this world who compares to my wife. I want her, and only her. Save your efforts for someone who cares.”

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Oh my God. Did he just—? A giddy laugh bubbled in her chest. Turns out I’m so irresistible he’s completely smitten.

Inside the office, the usually ice-cold Nathan suddenly smirked, a faint flush dusting his cheeks. The woman across from him gaped.

Nathan didn’t spare her another glance. His wife rarely visited the office—today was a good day.

He stood and strode toward the door.

“One more thing,” he added, pausing. “I’ll be notifying your company to assign a new project lead. Blackwood Enterprises is happy to collaborate—but only if you’re removed from the equation.”

The door swung open.

Evelyn barely had time to school her expression before Nathan’s piercing gaze locked onto hers.

“Darling,” he murmured, lips curving. “You’re just in time.”

The woman's expression twisted in shock. Even if her attempt to seduce him had failed, she didn't deserve such blatant disdain. What kind of man is he?

Little did she know, Nathan Blackwood was fiercely protective of anything concerning Evelyn Sinclair. The moment Evelyn had spotted them together, he had to make his stance crystal clear—no room for misunderstandings, no hint of scandal touching his wife.

Evelyn sighed at her husband's overbearing CEO tendencies, but just then, the office door swung open unexpectedly, sending her stumbling forward.

She could have caught herself—if only someone hadn't been so quick to react.

Nathan's arms wrapped around her, pulling her flush against his chest. The scene looked far too deliberate, as if she had thrown herself into his embrace.

A low chuckle rumbled through him, vibrating against her.

"Why are you here?" His voice was deep, intimate, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

"Your mother sent desserts," Evelyn replied, holding up the box.

Nathan released her only to tug her inside, shutting the door behind them.

Evelyn's gaze flicked to the other woman—tall, striking, dressed to impress. She didn’t bother with pleasantries.

The woman had done her research. She knew exactly who Evelyn was, but seeing her in person was a different kind of blow. Photos didn’t capture the effortless elegance, the way Evelyn carried herself with unshakable confidence. The woman’s earlier bravado crumbled under the weight of Evelyn’s sheer presence.

With Nathan’s cold dismissal, she had no choice but to leave, pride in tatters.

Evelyn barely spared her another thought. Her attention was stolen by the office she hadn’t visited in months.

Her breath hitched.

The walls, once adorned with prestigious artwork, were now plastered with her—glamorous shots, candid moments, magazine covers. It looked less like a CEO’s office and more like a talent agency obsessed with a single star.

Oh god.

She finally understood the conversation she’d overheard earlier.

Her cheeks burned. If any of the staff walked in now… No. Don’t even think about it.

Nathan pretended not to notice her reaction, calmly taking the dessert box and guiding her to the sofa. But the tips of his ears? Burning red.

This wasn’t for show. Nathan wanted Evelyn close, even when she wasn’t physically there. At Quirk Group’s artist division and her own studio, her face was everywhere—why should his office be any different?

If he had his way, she’d be by his side every day. But Evelyn would never agree to that, so this was his compromise.

And he wasn’t sorry about it.

This would also make everyone recognize Evelyn's position.

Evelyn couldn't read Nathan's thoughts, so she feigned indifference toward the posters to avoid an awkward situation by asking about them.

"Try some of Mom's cooking," Evelyn said.

Nathan opened the box and stared at the golden-yellow pastries, momentarily speechless.

"My mom is a disaster in the kitchen. Remember?"

Evelyn smirked. "Relax, others have already tested it. It's rare for her to succeed, so she insisted I bring it to you."

Dad and Theodore had survived eating it—otherwise, she wouldn’t have dared hand it over to Nathan. Imagine the CEO collapsing from food poisoning and being rushed to the hospital. The scandal would be legendary.

Nathan felt a warm satisfaction settle in his chest. His wife did care about him.

Despite the questionable taste, he couldn’t waste Margaret’s effort. They  the meal together, snapping a photo to send back to her.

On her end, Margaret had already received word from Richard’s informant that the troublemaker had been dealt with thoroughly. She could finally relax.

After eating, Evelyn showed no signs of leaving, and Nathan certainly wouldn’t suggest it. He wanted her to stay longer, so she scrolled through her phone while he worked.

Then, Nathan’s phone rang.

Seeing it was Grayson, he answered on speaker.

"Hey Julian, free tonight? I’m throwing a pool party at XX Club. You and Evelyn should come. Everyone else will be there."

Nathan frowned. Grayson never invited him to these kinds of events. Why the sudden change?

"Are you coming? No? Fine, just Evelyn then." Grayson’s tone was impatient.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Something felt off. He rarely got alone time with Evelyn—maybe they could have a private date instead. But...

"I’ll ask Evelyn."

Respecting her opinion, he turned to her.

Evelyn blinked. She’d never attended anything like this before.

A pool party? Swimsuits? A sea of gorgeous men and women?

Hearing her eager tone, Nathan felt his eye twitch.

Sure enough, Evelyn was grinning mischievously. At this moment, he really wanted to decline.

Nathan in swim trunks. Oh my. I'd kill to see that. Maybe I could even run my fingers over those sculpted abs! A godlike man emerging from the water—what a vision.

Nathan's cheeks flushed pink as Grayson kept insisting over the phone.

"Are we... actually going?" Nathan's gaze darted away nervously.

"Absolutely!" Evelyn answered without hesitation.

Nathan cleared his throat and relayed their acceptance to Grayson.

The moment the call ended, Evelyn practically dragged Nathan to the nearest boutique for swimwear.

Meanwhile, Grayson was frantically texting everyone, scrambling to throw together this impromptu party. His friends in the group chat were baffled by his sudden enthusiasm, but Grayson was too preoccupied to notice their confusion.

A few even tagged Nathan and Evelyn directly, skeptical about their attendance.

As curiosity about Grayson's bizarre behavior grew, Evelyn decided to investigate.

What she uncovered was... enlightening.

Unbelievable! Just because Gwendolyn had been giving him the cold shoulder, Grayson convinced himself she was playing hard to get. His brilliant plan? Throw this party where she'd be working, casually show up with another woman on his arm to make her jealous, then "magnanimously" give her a second chance.

And the reason he wanted Evelyn there? Pure manipulation. He knew Gwendolyn would approach Evelyn if she saw her. Using me as bait? Really?

Nathan's eyebrows shot up when Evelyn explained. "That's... pathetically transparent. Does Grayson really need public humiliation to realize how ridiculous he's being?"

But Evelyn was already giggling with mischief. "Oh, this will be delicious."

She randomly grabbed a swimsuit from the display.

Nathan suddenly choked. "You're... choosing that one?"

In Evelyn's hands was what could barely be considered a bikini—more like strategically placed strings. She blinked, realizing she hadn't actually looked at it properly. Tilting her head, she asked, "Got any suggestions?"

Having never attended such events before, she genuinely didn't know what was appropriate.

Nathan's eyes immediately darted toward a modest one-piece with childish ruffles.

"Good lord, Nathan," a woman's voice drawled from the entrance. "That's the most tragic swimsuit I've ever seen. Are you seriously recommending that to your wife?"

They turned to see a stunning woman leaning against the doorway, her crimson lips curved in amusement.

###Chapter 243 It Has Been Years Since We Broke Up

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she paced nervously by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Her fingers trembled slightly as she scrolled through her phone, rereading Nathan Blackwood's last message for the tenth time.

"We need to talk. Tonight. 8 PM. My place."

Four curt sentences that had kept her awake all night.

Lillian Graves, her ever-perceptive assistant, placed a steaming cup of chamomile tea on the marble counter. "You're going to wear a hole in that imported Italian flooring," she remarked dryly.

Evelyn forced a laugh, but it came out brittle. "Just... pre-meeting jitters."

"With Mr. Blackwood?" Lillian arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Since when do you get nervous about seeing your own fiancé?"

Since I found those damning texts from Victoria Hayes, Evelyn thought bitterly. The memory of Nathan's phone lighting up with his secretary's messages—"You were incredible last night" and "When can I see you again?"—made her stomach churn.

Her engagement ring caught the sunlight, scattering prismatic reflections across the walls. Three months ago, this diamond had symbolized fairy-tale promises. Now it felt like an anchor dragging her into icy depths.

At precisely 7:45 PM, Evelyn stood outside Nathan's Tribeca loft, her knuckles hovering inches from the door. The scent of his cologne—spicy bergamot with a hint of cedar—drifted through the cracks, triggering a wave of visceral memories: his lips tracing her collarbone, strong hands spanning her waist, whispered endearments in the dark.

The door swung open before she could knock.

Nathan stood silhouetted against the dim interior, his usually immaculate appearance uncharacteristically disheveled. Five o'clock shadow darkened his jawline, and his navy silk shirt hung untucked over tailored slacks.

"You're early," he murmured, stepping aside to let her pass.

Evelyn's stilettos clicked against the hardwood as she entered the lion's den. Her breath hitched when she spotted two wine glasses on the coffee table—one still smudged with lipstick the exact shade of Victoria's signature crimson.

Nathan followed her gaze and stiffened. "That's not what it—"

"Save it." Evelyn's voice surprised her with its steadiness. She reached into her Birkin and slid a manila envelope across the glass surface. "I believe these belong to you."

Nathan's tanned fingers made quick work of the clasp. Photographs spilled out—grainy but unmistakable. Him and Victoria emerging from a SoHo boutique at 2 AM. Their heated embrace outside The Pierre Hotel. The damning shot of Victoria slipping a keycard into his pocket.

The silence stretched like a live wire between them until Nathan finally spoke, his baritone roughened with emotion. "Evelyn, I can explain—"

A shrill ringtone cut through the tension. Victoria's name flashed across his phone screen.

In that crystalline moment, Evelyn's decision crystallized. She twisted the engagement ring off her finger and set it atop the incriminating photos with deliberate finality.

"I think," she said softly, "you should answer that."

As she turned toward the door, Nathan's hand shot out to grasp her wrist. His touch still ignited traitorous sparks along her skin. "Wait. Just... let me fix this."

Evelyn met his stormy gray eyes—the same eyes that had once made her believe in soulmates—and gently extracted herself. "Some things," she whispered, "can't be fixed."

The elevator doors slid shut behind her, muffling the sound of Nathan's phone hitting the wall with a resounding crash.

The woman’s delicate fingers toyed carelessly with her sunglasses, the afternoon sunlight glinting off their sleek frames. Dressed in a figure-hugging ensemble that accentuated her toned physique, she exuded confidence with every step. Her arched brows and bold crimson lips gave her an air of effortless allure, a stark contrast to the muted tones of the shopping district around her.

But what caught Evelyn Sinclair’s attention wasn’t just the woman’s striking presence—it was her face.

She looked uncannily like Gwendolyn Brooks.

Is that Vivian Moore?

Nathan Blackwood chose that moment to speak, his voice smooth but laced with mild surprise. "Vivian. You’re back."

Vivian’s lips curled into a knowing smile as she approached. "Just landed this morning. Didn’t expect you to be the first familiar face I’d run into. Since when do you step foot in a mall, Nathan? You’re more of a ‘send-the-staff’ kind of man."

Though her words were directed at Nathan, her sharp, curious gaze lingered on Evelyn, brimming with intrigue but devoid of hostility.

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Hello, I’m Evelyn."

"Oh, I know," Vivian drawled, amusement dancing in her eyes. "Nathan’s legendary wife. The gossip circles overseas have been buzzing about you. They make you sound like some kind of enchantress." She tilted her head, studying Evelyn with open fascination. "So tell me—how did you manage to thaw this walking ice sculpture?"

After all, even Cassandra—with all her calculated charm—had failed spectacularly. Vivian had nearly laughed herself sick when she heard about the woman’s humiliating retreat before she’d even returned to the country.

Back in their university days, everyone had assumed Nathan and Cassandra were the perfect golden couple. But Vivian had always seen through the façade—one clueless, the other pretending. A hollow performance.

What really grated on her was how Cassandra had slithered back after Nathan’s marriage, stirring up trouble like some desperate antagonist in a bad drama. Pathetic.

But Evelyn? Now she was interesting. Anyone who could crack Nathan Blackwood’s infamous emotional fortress was worth knowing.

Vivian’s bluntness was tempered by a playful charm, making her words land with more curiosity than rudeness.

Still, Evelyn couldn’t help but correct her. "Nathan isn’t cold."

Nathan stiffened slightly beside her.

A memory flickered at the edge of his consciousness—

"Honestly, Mr. Blackwood might as well be a robot. Does he even feel anything?"

"You’re wrong. Nathan feels everything. You just don’t see it."

His gaze softened as it settled on Evelyn, warmth bleeding into his usually impassive expression—so palpable that even Vivian noticed and suppressed a shiver.

Well, well.

This was going to be fascinating.

She had thought the rumors were exaggerated, but reality proved even more astonishing. It was painfully obvious—Nathan was utterly devoted to his wife.

Vivian nearly burst out laughing. The transformation in Nathan was so drastic it bordered on unbelievable.

"Alright, he's not a robot anymore. He's finally human. But his fashion sense?" Vivian pointed at the swimsuit Nathan had picked out—a frumpy ensemble that resembled a child's beachwear. The top had an awkward drooping neckline that would swallow Evelyn's décolletage, while the shorts came with a ridiculous skirt-like fringe.

On a toddler, it might be cute. On a grown woman with Evelyn's modelesque curves? A crime against aesthetics.

"For a private pool, this is overkill. If you actually let her wear this in public, people would laugh her off the scene. Do you want your wife to become a meme?" Vivian delivered the brutal truth without mercy.

Nathan flushed, his confidence crumbling. Social gatherings weren't his forte—he usually ignored the crowd at pool parties, never paying attention to what others wore.

"Sorry, I didn’t realize," Nathan muttered, his subtle attempt at modesty thoroughly thwarted.

Evelyn bit her lip to keep from defending his choice. Secretly, she’d thought it was sweet.

"Let me handle this. My taste is impeccable." Vivian flipped through the rack before casually asking, "What’s the occasion, anyway?"

Evelyn perked up, her inner gossip radar buzzing.

Nathan didn’t hesitate. "Grayson’s pool party. Everyone’s going."

Evelyn’s eyes darted to Vivian’s face, eager for a reaction.

Vivian laughed. "Perfect. I’ve been meaning to catch up with everyone since I got back. Mind if I tag along? It’ll be a fun surprise."

Oh, this is too good. The real ex shows up while he’s parading around his rebound? The drama writes itself.

Nathan’s jaw twitched.

Vivian caught his expression and arched a brow. "What? Not welcome? Don’t tell me Grayson’s still bitter. We broke up years ago."

Clearly, Grayson’s petty revenge plot—flaunting lookalikes on social media—had failed spectacularly. Vivian hadn’t even noticed. The look on his face when he realized his efforts were wasted? Priceless.

Influenced by Evelyn’s barely contained amusement, Nathan almost smirked—but he remembered Grayson was still his friend. He cleared his throat. "I don’t see why not. If you’re fine with it, we’ll go together."

Vivian shrugged. Why wouldn’t I be fine with it?

Since they were all attending, Vivian needed a swimsuit too. She resumed browsing, her designer’s eye zeroing in on the most daring options—until she felt Nathan’s glare burning into her back.

Right. Maybe not the barely-there bikini.

With a sigh, she settled for something stylish yet modest enough to keep the overprotective husband from combusting.

Evelyn Sinclair was married now, and her husband was right beside her. That’s why she opted for a swimsuit that was stylish yet modest—something elegant but not too revealing.

Her own choice, however, was daring. The moment she stepped out in it, Gwendolyn Brooks nearly choked on her drink.

Nathan Blackwood, ever the gentleman, insisted on paying for everything. Vivian Moore treated them to an early dinner before they headed to the exclusive club.

The trio was escorted to the changing rooms.

Vivian, meticulous as always, needed time to layer on sunscreen and serums before swimming. She waved Evelyn off, telling her not to wait. Evelyn, eager to find Gwendolyn, stepped out first.

And there he was.

Nathan stood near a marble pillar, his swim trunks tastefully understated, paired with an unbuttoned linen shirt that only partially concealed his sculpted torso. The fabric fluttered slightly in the breeze, teasing glimpses of his toned abdomen.

At that moment, he was the center of attention. Tall, striking, effortlessly magnetic. Women passing by stole glances—some bold, some shy—while even a few men did double takes.

His presence was impossible to ignore. Broad shoulders tapered into a lean waist, his posture relaxed yet commanding.

Then, a brave soul approached him.

Nathan, who had been indifferent to every lingering gaze, suddenly looked up.

His eyes locked onto Evelyn.

A flush crept up his neck. His fingers twitched at his sides, as if unsure whether to adjust his shirt or run them through his hair.

Evelyn moved toward him, but before she could reach him, a woman intercepted Nathan with a coy smile.

###Chapter 244 Another Casualty

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, painting the sleek marble floors in warm hues. She stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absently as she gazed at the city below. The view was breathtaking, but her mind was elsewhere—lost in the whirlwind of emotions that had consumed her since last night.

Nathan Blackwood had done it again.

Just when she thought she had finally moved on, he had reappeared in her life like a storm, leaving chaos in his wake. His words from their heated argument replayed in her mind, each syllable sharp enough to reopen old wounds.

"You think you can just walk away, Evelyn? You and I—we’re not ."

A shiver ran down her spine. She hated how easily he could unravel her composure.

Her phone buzzed on the counter, pulling her from her thoughts. It was a message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

Lillian: "The meeting with Preston Whitmore is confirmed for 2 PM. Also, Victoria Hayes called—again. She insists it’s urgent."

Evelyn’s grip on her cup tightened. Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, had been relentless in her attempts to reach her. Whatever game Nathan was playing, she wasn’t interested.

She typed back quickly.

Evelyn: "Tell her I’m unavailable. Indefinitely."

Setting the phone down, she exhaled sharply. She had a script reading later with Donovan Sharpe, and she needed to be focused. The last thing she needed was Nathan’s drama bleeding into her career.

But fate, it seemed, had other plans.

As she turned to head to her closet, the intercom buzzed. The doorman’s voice crackled through.

"Ms. Sinclair, there’s a Mr. Blackwood here to see you. He says it’s important."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Of course he would show up unannounced. That was Nathan’s specialty—disrupting her life when she least expected it.

She hesitated, then pressed the intercom button.

"Tell him I’m not home."

A deep, familiar chuckle echoed through the speaker before the doorman could respond.

"Nice try, Evelyn. But I can see your shadow moving from here."

Her breath hitched. Damn him.

She marched to the door and yanked it open. Nathan stood there, looking infuriatingly composed in his tailored suit, his dark eyes glinting with amusement.

"What do you want?" she demanded.

He smirked, stepping forward without invitation. "We need to talk."

She blocked his path. "We said everything last night."

His expression darkened. "No, you ran. Again."

The air between them crackled with tension. She wanted to slam the door in his face, but something in his gaze held her still.

Then he said the words that shattered her resolve.

"Eleanor’s back."

Evelyn froze.

Nathan’s first love—the woman who had once torn them apart—was back?

Her stomach twisted. This wasn’t just a game.

This was war.

"Hey gorgeous, can I get your digits?" a woman purred, batting her lashes at Nathan.

He acted deaf, smoothly stepping around her without breaking stride.

Another beauty intercepted him near the champagne fountain. "That suit looks custom-made. Are you VIP section?" She twirled a lock of hair around her finger. "Let's ditch this crowd."

Nathan's jaw tightened as he sidestepped her spilled cocktail.

"Wait!" A third woman blocked his path with a manicured hand. "Don't I know you from the Blackwood Tower opening?"

His patience thinning, Nathan brushed past without acknowledgment.

The rejected trio huddled like wounded songbirds.

"Stone cold."
"Probably married to his work."
"Or his personal trainer."

These weren't ordinary club girls - each carried themselves like runway models, though none recognized the elusive Blackwood heir. Their designer heels tapped impatiently as they plotted their next move.

Then they saw her.

Evelyn Sinclair moved through the crowd like liquid moonlight, her emerald cocktail dress catching every eye. Normally makeup-free, tonight's smoky eyes and bloodred lips transformed her into someone unrecognizable to casual observers. The rejected beauties exchanged knowing smirks - another lamb to the slaughter.

Nathan saw her coming. Saw the mischief sparking in those usually serious eyes.

Before he could speak, Evelyn hooked a finger in his silk tie. "Big spender," she murmured, lips brushing his ear. "Buy a girl a drink?"

The crowd held its breath.

Nathan's response sent shockwaves through the room: "Your wish, my command."

Evelyn's triumphant grin could've powered the city as she draped herself over his arm. The walk to the rooftop pool became a victory march, every step burning with the heat of a hundred jealous stares.

She missed how Nathan's muscles locked beneath his tailored suit. Missed the way his pulse jumped where her bare thigh pressed against him. The thin silk of her dress left nothing to imagination, and the Blackwood heir found himself drowning in sensory overload.

By the time they reached the pool's edge, Nathan's self-control hung by a thread. Evelyn's laughter as she kicked off her heels? The final snap.

Evelyn's curious gaze swept across the crowded venue. Among the vibrantly dressed guests, a dozen uniformed staff members moved discreetly in black and white attire. Yet Gwendolyn was nowhere to be seen.

Their entire circle had arrived early. Marcus and Vivian were splashing about in the pool, their laughter carrying across the water. Beatrice, Lucas, and Daniel lounged at the poolside lounge area, greeting them with knowing smiles as they approached.

"Evelyn, you're truly remarkable," Lucas remarked with an amused chuckle. "We've been trying to get him to attend these gatherings for years without success."

Daniel turned his head with an identical smirk. "Refreshing change, isn't it?"

Beatrice merely arched an eyebrow, her playful grin speaking volumes.

Normally, Nathan would ignore their teasing entirely.

"Where's Grayson?" Evelyn inquired curiously.

"Fetching his latest conquest," Vivian answered from her floating perch in the pool.

Marcus gave her float a playful shove. "Another replacement? I rather liked the last one."

"Apparently she caught Grayson watching Vivian's overseas fashion competition footage," Lucas explained with a laugh. "Even rebounds have their breaking points."

"I don't approve of Grayson's behavior," Beatrice stated firmly.

"Playing with hearts brings bad karma," Daniel added sagely.

Evelyn couldn't help protesting, "Why is everyone so convinced Gwendolyn has feelings for Grayson?"

The group exchanged startled glances. Evelyn wondered if they'd all been charmed by Grayson's charisma or fooled by Gwendolyn's Oscar-worthy performance. The notion that a rebound could fall for the leading man seemed straight out of a soap opera.

Lucas leaned forward conspiratorially. "Between us? I think he's developed real feelings too. He's just too proud to admit it. That 'rebound' might have become something more in his heart."

Their conversation halted as Grayson approached, his arm possessively around the waist of a stunning brunette.

"Discussing me behind my back again?" Grayson asked with his trademark arrogance.

Keep that smug attitude, Evelyn thought as Nathan guided her to a seat. Your comeuppance is coming.

As they settled into their seats, Nathan casually remarked, "We ran into an old friend while shopping for swimwear earlier. They'll be joining us soon."

Grayson barely reacted, his attention clearly elsewhere. In his mind, such trivialities weren’t worth acknowledging—not when he was impatiently waiting for a certain rebellious woman to arrive.

Since Grayson didn’t press for details, Nathan felt no need to elaborate. The others, however, were burning with curiosity, but before they could ask, Grayson introduced his new date.

Only Evelyn didn’t recognize the striking woman beside him. The rest of the group exchanged knowing glances, their expressions turning slightly uneasy at the sight of her.

The newcomer was Lila Carter, a woman with undeniable influence. Though she greeted them with a polished smile, there was an unmistakable sharpness in her gaze—a silent warning that she wasn’t one to be crossed.

Once Evelyn and Nathan were seated, Nathan leaned in, lowering his voice to share the latest gossip. "Lila used to be obsessed with Grayson. Personality-wise, she’s a lot like Vivian—same intensity, same persistence. After dealing with Vivian, Grayson wanted nothing to do with Lila. He rejected her multiple times… until now."

Tsk, tsk. Grayson, you never learn, do you? Evelyn thought smugly. You break one woman’s heart to win back another, then repeat the same mistake. Is this really the only trick you know? No wonder you keep failing. Karma’s a bitch, and I can’t wait to see how this blows up in your face.

Grayson, oblivious to their whispers, pulled Lila closer, draping an arm around her waist as he signaled for the waiter. He laughed at something she said, their intimacy so exaggerated it made the others avert their eyes.

Lucas, ever the gossip, had heard about Daniel and Sophia’s situation and couldn’t resist prying. "So, I heard you played the hero for her. What happened after that?"

Daniel rubbed his temples, exasperated. "Drop it. It was nothing. Once she sorted things out with Mason, she left the country with her father."

"No way," Beatrice chimed in, unusually invested. "You two seemed like a good match."

"Don’t worry about me," Daniel chuckled. "It wasn’t serious. We barely knew each other—just a strange, fleeting moment."

Sophia had left an impression, sure, but they’d exchanged numbers more out of politeness than anything else. After everything with Amelia, Daniel wasn’t in the mood for romance. Right now, his priority was his mother. Maybe, in the future, if their paths crossed again… but for now, they were worlds apart.

Seeing that the conversation was going nowhere, Evelyn—who had the full scoop thanks to her Gossip System—decided to let the topic die.

Just then, a line of waiters approached, each carrying a tray of cocktails.

A sharp gasp cut through the hum of the nightclub.

Evelyn Sinclair’s gaze flickered across the room—only to lock onto the wide, startled eyes of Gwendolyn Brooks.

.

Since they’d entered from the side closest to Evelyn, Gwendolyn hadn’t yet spotted Grayson Hart at the far end of the VIP section.

“What a surprise!” Evelyn arched a brow, lips curving. “Working here tonight?”

Gwendolyn’s cheeks flushed pink. “Ms. Sinclair! It’s—it’s so good to see you. I’m covering a shift for a coworker. What are the chances?” Her fingers twisted in the hem of her server’s vest. “I can’t believe I get to see you again so soon.”

The rest of the group noticed her instantly. Expressions shifted—some skeptical, others amused.

Coincidence? Hardly. Is she stalking Grayson now?
He called it. She’s totally playing games.
But ignoring him completely? Bold move.
Oh, this is going to be good. Lila’s right there—will they throw down?

Grayson’s arm tightened around Lila Carter’s waist. His stare burned into the two women chatting, yet Gwendolyn still hadn’t so much as glanced his way.

She and Evelyn were clearly deep in conversation.

Grayson’s jaw worked. Once. Twice. Then—

A loud, pointed cough.

Gwendolyn finally turned. Her smile froze.

“Are staff here permitted to socialize instead of serving?” Grayson’s voice dripped ice. He tugged Lila closer, smirking. “Or is there special treatment for certain guests?”

Internally, he scoffed. Let’s see how long the act lasts.

Across the club, Vivian Moore wove through the crowd. Recognition flashed across faces—followed by shock. Their breakup had been scandalous back in the day.

###Chapter 245 Is She A Deity Idol

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absently as she watched the city below come to life.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, turning to see Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stride in with a tablet in hand.

"You have a meeting with Preston Whitmore in an hour," Lillian announced, swiping through her schedule. "And Nathan Blackwood's office just called. They want to confirm your attendance at the charity gala tonight."

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "Of course they do." She set her cup down. "Tell them I'll be there."

Lillian hesitated, then added, "Victoria Hayes is also on the guest list."

Evelyn's smile faded. "Perfect." She exhaled sharply. "Just what I needed—another public showdown with Nathan's scheming secretary."

"Should I—"

"No," Evelyn cut her off. "I can handle Victoria." She straightened her blazer. "But let's make sure I'm not seated anywhere near her."

Lillian nodded, making a note. "I'll arrange it."

As Evelyn gathered her things, her phone buzzed. A message from Serena Whitmore, her agent, flashed on the screen: Don't forget—the press will be all over you tonight. Play nice with Nathan.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Play nice. As if she hadn't been doing that for months.

The drive to the studio was uneventful, but her mind raced with the evening's possibilities. The gala was a high-profile event, and every move she made would be scrutinized. Nathan would be there, charming as ever, with Victoria lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce on any misstep.

Preston Whitmore greeted her warmly when she arrived. "Evelyn, you look radiant as always."

"Flattery will get you everywhere, Preston," she teased, though her smile didn't quite reach her eyes.

They discussed the upcoming project, but Evelyn's attention kept drifting. Tonight wasn't just about the gala—it was about proving she could stand her ground, even in Nathan's world.

As the meeting wrapped up, Preston leaned forward. "You seem distracted. Everything alright?"

Evelyn hesitated, then sighed. "Just... navigating complicated waters."

He gave her a knowing look. "Ah. The Blackwood effect."

She laughed dryly. "Something like that."

Back in her car, Evelyn checked her phone again. Another message, this time from Nathan himself: Looking forward to seeing you tonight.

Her fingers hovered over the screen. She typed, then deleted, then typed again before settling on a simple: Likewise.

The response was immediate: Don't sound too excited.

She smirked. I'll save my excitement for when you finally fire Victoria.

His reply came fast. Not happening.

Evelyn tossed her phone onto the seat beside her. Some battles, it seemed, were far from over.

As her driver pulled up to her apartment, she steeled herself for the night ahead. The gala would be a battlefield—one she intended to win.

Because if there was one thing Evelyn Sinclair knew how to do, it was fight.

By the poolside, anyone who knew Grayson could tell he was deliberately causing a scene.

Grayson watched Gwendolyn intently, expecting her to crumble at the sight of him with another woman. He imagined her heartbreak, the regret washing over her as she realized her mistake—how foolish she had been to defy him. After all, he was a man who responded to sweetness, not defiance.

If she swallowed her pride and begged, he might just let her back into his life. Maybe even grant her the coveted title of girlfriend.

But the past weeks without her had been unbearable—like reliving a nightmare.

She needed to learn her lesson.

Yet, the reaction he anticipated never came. Gwendolyn merely glanced at him—first startled, then mildly annoyed. Was that… amusement tugging at the corner of her lips?

As a staff member, she bowed politely. "My apologies, sir, for the interruption."

Her composure only fueled his irritation—and a twisted sense of satisfaction.

Lila, however, wasn’t having it. Her expression darkened as she glared at Gwendolyn.

"Call the manager. This kind of unprofessional behavior deserves termination."

Gwendolyn’s stomach dropped. She couldn’t let her friend lose her job because of this. Frantically, she scrambled for a solution.

Daniel, unable to stand by while a grown man bullied a woman, moved to intervene—until Isabelle suddenly spoke.

"Oh, come now," she drawled, flipping her hair. "I was just chatting with my biggest fan. Why the hostility? Are you trying to embarrass me? If we’re not welcome here, why invite us at all?"

Isabelle rarely took a stand, but when she did, it was for her fans.

Grayson and Lila froze.

They hadn’t expected Isabelle—a socialite from their own circle—to defend a mere staff member. Was she out of her mind? Risking social capital over this?

Gwendolyn was just as shocked. Isabelle wasn’t known for her charity.

Then the manager arrived, sweating bullets. One look at his terrified face confirmed it—he’d throw Gwendolyn under the bus to appease the elite.

She was doomed.

Even if Evelyn hadn't spoken up for Gwendolyn, that fool Grayson would still be wielding his power to play his twisted game of bittersweet revenge due to Gwendolyn's defiance. It was despicable enough that his actions had cost an ordinary worker her job. I needed to find a solution.

Evelyn was deep in thought when, before Gwendolyn’s manager could even apologize, Nathan suddenly spoke.

"Gwendolyn has done an excellent job," Nathan said, his voice cool and commanding. "I’d like her to personally attend to my wife and me for the remainder of the evening."

His tone was deceptively casual, but the underlying authority left no room for argument.

The manager, well aware of Nathan’s status, paled slightly before nodding eagerly. "Of course, Mr. Blackwood. It’s no trouble at all." He quickly instructed Gwendolyn to give the two VIPs her undivided attention.

Evelyn’s heart swelled with delight.

Nathan gets me. He’s absolutely perfect.

A faint smirk tugged at Nathan’s lips.

The onlookers were stunned.

They had expected to witness nothing more than the petty drama between Grayson, Lila, and Gwendolyn. But now, Nathan and Evelyn had stepped in, turning the tables.

Lila, whose family status was far beneath theirs, wisely kept her mouth shut, not daring to provoke them.

Grayson, however, glowered at the couple, irritation flashing in his eyes. He might have been annoyed, but challenging Nathan? Not a chance.

Gwendolyn, meanwhile, gazed at Evelyn and Nathan with stars in her eyes, gratitude radiating from her.

Who would’ve thought? I was being bullied, and my idol defended me. Even her husband backed me up. Just who is this goddess I’m a fan of?

And so, Gwendolyn stayed by their side, serving them with renewed confidence.

Grayson shot her a venomous glare, but she didn’t spare him a single glance. He scoffed, convinced she was just putting on an act.

"What’s this?" Grayson snapped, his voice dripping with displeasure.

"Taking care of my fan," Evelyn replied sweetly, flashing him a dazzling smile.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Lila interjected, her voice laced with fake concern. "I think you’ve been deceived. Everyone knows about her past. Her sudden appearance here is far too convenient, don’t you think? Maybe she’s deliberately seeking out Mr. Hart. Be careful—this social-climbing schemer might be pretending to be your fan just to manipulate you into helping her win him back."

Her words were sharp, her expression venomous as she stared at Gwendolyn.

Gwendolyn’s face went slack with shock.

Lila, expecting a reaction of guilt or anger, was baffled by her stunned silence.

Shouldn't she be feigning flustered outrage or panicking about being caught red-handed?

Gwendolyn Brooks was seething with frustration. She longed to snap back but dared not offend these spoiled socialites. After all, she was just a working-class girl. Yet she feared Isabelle might misinterpret her intentions and desperately wanted to clarify.

Instead, she caught Isabelle barely suppressing her amusement. "So you're saying she discovered Grayson would attend and deliberately positioned herself here beforehand, just to parade before him?"

Lila Carter shot Isabelle a triumphant look.

The surrounding crowd mirrored this sentiment, their expressions nearly identical.

Wait—why did Grayson wear that smug expression too? Had his narcissism completely erased the memory of who'd orchestrated this entire charade? Hold on. He probably assumed Gwendolyn, as staff, must've known he was hosting. Why else would she appear unless she wanted to see him? Thus his certainty that she'd secretly schemed to meet him. But—couldn't she simply have picked up an extra shift without knowing the guest list?

Isabelle was visibly struggling not to laugh as she countered, "But weren't we only notified about this party at noon today?"

Her single remark gradually silenced the room.

Ignoring Grayson's frozen expression, Isabelle turned to Gwendolyn. "What time did your shift start?"

"Eight this morning," Gwendolyn answered instantly, catching Isabelle's drift.

Isabelle shrugged, addressing Lila with exaggerated sincerity. "Seems you've misjudged, Lila. Her presence here is purely coincidental!"

The timeline suggested something far more damning—that Grayson had planned the event after discovering Gwendolyn's work schedule. Yet no one suspected face-saving motives. Given his earlier provocation, they assumed the rejected playboy was deliberately stirring trouble.

Lila's face darkened at the rebuttal, but she refused to accept Gwendolyn's innocence. A venomous idea struck.

With an icy smile, she purred, "Mrs. Blackwood, I'm merely offering friendly advice. Her conveniently appearing before you speaks volumes, no? Why not ask her directly—does she want back in Grayson's bed?"

The gasps were audible.

Gwendolyn's hands clenched. Isabelle's eyes flashed dangerously. Grayson's smirk vanished.

The tension crackled like live wires.

Then—

A champagne flute shattered against the marble floor.

All heads swiveled toward the interruption.

A statuesque blonde in a silver Versace gown stood framed in the archway, her crimson lips curved in contempt.

"Well, well," drawled the uninvited guest. "If it isn't the pathetic little waitress and her delusional fan club."

Recognition dawned on multiple faces.

Vivian Moore—Grayson's most notorious ex—had arrived.

And she looked ready for war.
###Chapter 246 Is She Swearing An Oath

Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still lingering on the remnants of last night’s dream—something about Nathan Blackwood and a scandalous secret.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant: "Don’t forget, the script reading is at 10 AM. And… you might want to check the tabloids. Drama alert."

Evelyn groaned. Drama was the last thing she needed today.

Scrolling through her feed, her eyes widened at the headline: "Vincent Holloway Spotted Leaving Seraphina Delacroix’s Penthouse at 3 AM!"

She nearly choked on her coffee. Vincent Holloway—the notorious playboy—and Seraphina Delacroix, the rising starlet? That was unexpected.

But what truly caught her attention was the mental whisper she accidentally picked up—Seraphina’s frantic thoughts, loud and clear in her mind: "Oh God, what if Maverick finds out? He’ll kill me!"

Evelyn smirked. Maverick Sutton—no, Sebastian Hart—was Seraphina’s ex and still held a grudge. This was juicy.

Then, another voice cut in—Nathan’s. "Why the hell is Evelyn smirking like that? Did she see the tabloids too?"

Her breath hitched. She hadn’t meant to eavesdrop on him.

Before she could process it, another thought followed—Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s scheming secretary: "If Evelyn’s distracted by gossip, maybe today’s the perfect time to push the merger papers through without her noticing."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her phone. Oh, hell no.

She quickly typed a reply to Lillian: "Change of plans. I’m coming in early. And tell Preston Whitmore I need five minutes with Nathan—alone."

Because if Victoria thought she could pull a fast one, Evelyn was about to ruin her entire week.

And maybe, just maybe, she’d drop a hint to Sebastian about Seraphina’s little secret.

After all, what was a morning without a little chaos?

Wow, bluntness—now that’s a bold move. They were treating Gwendolyn like some conniving, two-faced witch, cornering her into declaring her stance with no escape route left!

And that was exactly what Lila had intended.

She was utterly convinced Gwendolyn had feelings for Grayson. After all, this meek little thing had lingered by Grayson’s side for so long, content to play the role of a rebound. There was no way she hadn’t fallen for him.

Yet, Lila’s question was a double-edged sword. If Gwendolyn denied any interest in Grayson to save face, it would only widen the rift between them. But if she admitted she wanted him back, it would expose every past action as nothing but a calculated performance—proof of her deceit. She’d alienate everyone in one fell swoop, and Grayson would despise a woman like that.

So, what seemed like a ridiculous, even absurd question was actually the perfect trap for scheming women.

But the catch? Gwendolyn had to actually want Grayson back.

Isabelle internally groaned.

The moment Lila posed her question, the room buzzed with anticipation.

Gwendolyn had been the rebound who lasted the longest by Grayson’s side. Everyone suspected Grayson still cared for her, too.

At first, Grayson was irritated by Lila’s audacity. He’d planned to coax Gwendolyn into admitting her feelings on her own terms, not be forced into a public confession.

What if she was still bitter and declared she didn’t want him? That would only complicate things further.

But then… a thought struck him.

What if, in the end, Gwendolyn couldn’t resist her love for him? What if she cast aside all pride and risked humiliation just to say she wanted him back? The idea sent a thrill through him, stroking his ego.

Grayson’s lips curled into a smirk. He couldn’t resist adding, "Lila, what nonsense are you spouting? It’s not so easy to return to my side once you’ve left." His gaze flicked to Gwendolyn, challenging.

Meanwhile, Lila took his words as proof—Grayson didn’t really care about his rebound.

Gwendolyn, however, was seething.

What kind of nonsense was this? How had she even ended up in this mess? If she’d known her delusional ex-boss was coming, she would’ve stayed miles away.

Unbelievable.

Grayson had always been like this—convinced she was in love with him no matter how many times she denied it. It was like he couldn’t comprehend basic human language, too wrapped up in his own fantasy world.

Making money was one thing. But dealing with his inflated ego? Exhausting.

Gwendolyn couldn't care less whether Grayson believed her or not. After this absurd encounter, he probably thought she was the one who couldn’t move on. The injustice burned inside her. Were all wealthy men this delusional? Though, her idol and her husband were exceptions—they were wonderful.

A storm of silent curses raged in Gwendolyn’s mind before she finally answered with icy precision, "I don’t want to!"

The room froze.

Many had expected a refusal, but no one anticipated the sheer force behind her words—like a solemn oath, unshakable and resolute.

Why hadn’t she hesitated? Why hadn’t she stammered or looked conflicted before delivering that final blow?

Even Grayson, pride wounded, stiffened at her unwavering tone.

Only Isabelle—no, Amelia—couldn’t suppress her laughter any longer.

Grayson’s face flushed crimson. Realizing the scene he was making, he shot to his feet, voice sharp. "Gwendolyn, even anger has its limits."

She nearly rolled her eyes out of her skull. "Mr. Hart, I swear, I have zero interest in chasing after you. You and your lovely companion can rest easy!"

If not for the damn confidentiality clause, she would’ve shoved the contract in their faces. They were even. So where the hell did they get the idea she’d come crawling back?

Despite her blatant disgust, Grayson remained oblivious. He reached for her wrist, fingers tightening like a vice.

"Enough. We’re leaving." His tone brooked no argument—the classic domineering CEO move.

Her words had cut deeper than he’d admit. He cared, damn it. If pride was what she clung to, fine. He’d let her save face—in private.

But when he tried to drag her away, she didn’t budge.

Gwendolyn planted her feet, lowering her center of gravity like a wrestler bracing for a fight. Her expression screamed over my dead body.

The scene turned absurd—Grayson, the polished billionaire, now looked like a desperate kidnapper failing to haul away his hostage.

People gaped.

Gwendolyn, no stranger to physical labor, was stronger than she looked. Grayson’s "charming" display of dominance crumbled into an embarrassing stalemate.

Meanwhile, Lila—Grayson’s discarded date—nearly toppled off her chair in shock. Humiliation burned her cheeks as she watched the man she’d been clinging to moments ago now fixated on another woman.

Lila Carter shot up from her seat, her face flushed with fury as she stormed forward. "Mr. Hart, I'm your date tonight!"

"Move!" Grayson Hart snapped, already irritated from the struggle. Sweat beaded at his temples as his patience thinned.

His sharp command only stoked Lila's rage. She lunged forward, trying to pry Grayson and Gwendolyn apart.

The bizarre tug-of-war between the three of them became a spectacle no one could look away from—so riveting that even the arrival of an important guest went unnoticed.

Lila whirled on Gwendolyn, venom dripping from her words. "I see your game, you scheming little witch. You think playing hard to get will make Grayson fall for you? Newsflash—you're just a rebound. Do you honestly believe a man like him would ever want you? Stop deluding yourself!"

Though everyone knew the truth, hearing it laid bare made Grayson falter for a split second.

That momentary lapse was all Lila needed. With a forceful yank, she tore them apart and shoved Gwendolyn backward.

They were dangerously close to the pool.

Gwendolyn staggered, her arms flailing as she lost her balance.

"Watch out!" Isabelle Laurent cried, but it was too late.

Daniel Wright, the quickest among them, sprang into action, but he wasn't fast enough.

Just as Gwendolyn was about to hit the water, a figure darted into view—tan skin, curves accentuated by a daring swimsuit, crimson lips, and wavy hair that swayed with every movement.

Strong arms wrapped around Gwendolyn's waist, halting her fall. The momentum nearly sent her crashing into her savior's chest, leaving her stunned.

"You okay there, gorgeous?" A rich, amused voice rang out.

It was like something straight out of a cheesy romance novel—the dashing hero saving the damsel. The crowd froze, jaws slack. After all, it wasn't every day you saw her make an entrance.


###Chapter 247 - A Vow Sealed in Shadows

The scene unfolded like a twisted comedy. The so-called "golden child" swooping in to save the rebound? I pressed my lips together, biting back the laughter threatening to spill out.

Evelyn Sinclair—once the overlooked, now the center of this absurd spectacle—stood frozen, her fingers still curled around the champagne flute. Nathan Blackwood’s piercing gaze locked onto her, his presence commanding the room as effortlessly as ever. The air between them crackled, thick with unspoken tension.

Victoria Hayes, ever the serpent in silk, slithered closer, her crimson lips twisting into a smirk. "How noble," she drawled, voice dripping with mock admiration. "The prodigal heir, rushing to defend his true love."

Nathan didn’t flinch. "Some things," he said, voice low but razor-sharp, "are worth protecting. Even from their own mistakes."

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Evelyn’s cheeks flushed, but her chin lifted. "I don’t need saving," she countered, though her voice wavered just enough to betray her.

Nathan’s lips quirked. "Don’t you?"

The challenge hung between them, electric.

Then—laughter. Bright, unexpected, cutting through the tension like a blade. Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s ever-loyal agent, stepped forward, her grin sharp. "Oh, this is rich. The great Nathan Blackwood, playing knight for a woman who left him." She tilted her head. "Tell me, darling—did you rehearse this speech, or does martyrdom come naturally to you?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened, but before he could retort, Evelyn moved.

She set down her glass with deliberate calm. Then, eyes blazing, she stepped toe-to-toe with Victoria. "You want a show?" she whispered, voice lethally soft. "Fine."

A beat of silence. Then—

Evelyn snatched the champagne bottle from the nearest waiter and upended it over Victoria’s perfectly styled head.

Gasps. Shouts. Victoria’s shriek of outrage.

Evelyn didn’t blink. "Consider that my vow," she said, loud enough for everyone to hear. "Next time, I won’t miss."

And with that, she turned on her heel and walked out—leaving Nathan, the crowd, and the dripping, sputtering Victoria in her wake.

The doors swung shut behind her.

Silence.

Then—

Nathan laughed.

###Chapter 248 Twisted Perceptions

The tension in the penthouse was so thick it could be sliced with a knife. Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers gripping the edge of the marble countertop as she stared out at the glittering city below. The storm brewing inside her mirrored the dark clouds gathering over the skyline.

Nathan Blackwood’s voice cut through the silence, sharp and unyielding. "You knew this would happen, Evelyn. You walked into this knowing the risks."

She whirled around, her emerald eyes flashing with defiance. "I didn’t expect you to be the one holding the knife to my back, Nathan."

A muscle in his jaw twitched, but his expression remained unreadable. That infuriated her even more.

Victoria Hayes, ever the opportunist, chose that moment to step forward, her crimson lips curling into a smirk. "Oh, please. This was always going to end this way. You were just too blinded by your little fantasy to see it."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. She had trusted Nathan—against her better judgment—and now she was paying the price.

Serena Whitmore, her ever-loyal agent, placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. "We need to think strategically. Losing our cool won’t help."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Serena was right. But the betrayal stung deeper than she cared to admit.

Nathan’s phone buzzed, and he glanced at the screen before locking eyes with Evelyn. "It’s done. The board has voted. You’re out."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Evelyn straightened her spine, refusing to let them see her crumble. "Fine. But this isn’t over."

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "It is for you."

She turned on her heel and strode toward the door, her heels clicking against the polished floors. Just before she crossed the threshold, she paused and threw one last glance over her shoulder.

"Watch your back, Nathan. Because next time, I won’t hesitate."

The door slammed behind her, leaving behind a silence thick with unspoken threats.

Victoria smirked. "Well, that was dramatic."

Nathan didn’t respond. His mind was elsewhere—on the woman who had just walked out, and the war she had just declared.

And for the first time in years, he wondered if he had made a mistake.

"Why didn't you tell me?" Grayson's voice carried a sharp edge of displeasure. The reunion hadn’t gone as he’d envisioned—especially not with Vivian swooping in to save Gwendolyn. They should have been at each other’s throats, not caught in this absurdly civil exchange. If I’d known Vivian was coming, I would’ve orchestrated this differently.

As his thoughts spiraled, an unsettling sensation twisted in his chest. His gaze flickered toward Gwendolyn, who stood quietly to the side, head bowed. I knew it. Despite her earlier words, she was still hung up on him. Why else would she shrink into herself the moment Vivian appeared? She must realize she’s lost her place now that Vivian’s back. A bitter satisfaction curled inside him. She shouldn’t have tried playing games with me. Not everyone gets to play hard to get. Even if she cries now, I won’t soften.

Evelyn frowned when she caught Grayson stealing glances at Gwendolyn. Curiosity gnawed at her, so she tapped into her ability—and nearly choked suppressing a laugh. She’s just awkwardly trying to stay out of the way! Gwendolyn was on duty as staff, for heaven’s sake. With the drama resolved, of course she’d step aside to wait for the next task. Is Grayson seriously expecting her to march into the spotlight and perform some emotional breakdown?

"Gwendolyn," Evelyn called, barely keeping her amusement in check. "Lift your head. Let him see if there are tears on your face. Otherwise, he’ll spin some ridiculous narrative about you—and trust me, that’s worse than any scandal."

Expression flat, Nathan patted Evelyn’s back before answering Grayson’s earlier question in a weary tone. "I did mention it. You just didn’t ask."

Grayson opened his mouth to retort, but Evelyn cut in before he could.

She couldn’t hold back any longer. "Are you okay, Gwen?"

Gwendolyn lifted her head—no trace of melancholy, only mild concern. "I’m fine."

Evelyn grinned. "Great. Could you grab Vivian a glass of wine?"

Vivian glanced over, flashing a warm smile as she requested her drink, interacting with Gwendolyn as if they were old friends.

Gwendolyn returned the smile effortlessly before turning to prepare the order.

The party’s buzz gradually resumed as the crowd lost interest in the lack of theatrics.

Meanwhile, Grayson stood frozen, baffled by the lack of hostility between the two women. This wasn’t supposed to happen!

Bet you’re shocked. Neither of them cares about you. Time to retire the delusions. Evelyn smirked.

At that moment, Vivian paid Grayson no mind. Instead, she sidled up to Evelyn, pulling out her phone with a mischievous glint. "Since you’re in the industry, do you recognize him?" She flashed a photo of a strikingly handsome man, eyes sparkling with excitement.

Evelyn blinked, thrown by the abrupt topic shift.

Grayson’s sharp hearing caught the exchange, and his glare burned into the two women.

Oh, this just got interesting.

The others turned their attention toward the two women, the air thick with unspoken tension.

Vivian's lips twitched when she saw the photo—that handsome man was exactly her type.

"This is what delayed me earlier. I bumped into him the moment I stepped outside. He was so charming that I tried to strike up a conversation, but his manager intercepted me. Sadly, I don’t know much about local celebrities. It’d be wonderful if you could introduce us." Vivian's voice carried clearly, ensuring everyone nearby heard her bold declaration.

The atmosphere instantly turned icy.

This was a development Evelyn hadn’t anticipated. She discreetly glanced around and realized she wasn’t the only one stealing looks—everyone else was doing the same.

It was as if the sound of a heart shattering echoed through the room.

Checkmate. Grayson should finally understand what’s happening now. Evelyn thought.

Sure enough, Grayson’s expression darkened. His eyes burned with barely restrained fury as he glared at Vivian. Even when Lila tried to pull him back to his seat out of petty jealousy, he ignored her completely.

At that moment, Gwendolyn arrived with Vivian’s drink.

Just as Vivian was about to thank her, she paused. A flicker of confusion and resignation crossed her face as she tapped her manicured nails against the wine glass.

She then called out to Gwendolyn, who had already begun stepping away. "Could you pour me another glass, darling?"

Gwendolyn tensed, already nervous serving Vivian. "Is there something wrong with this one?"

Evelyn frowned. Vivian seemed friendly with Gwendolyn earlier. Why is she suddenly dissatisfied?

Before Vivian could respond, Grayson suddenly appeared, draping an arm possessively over Gwendolyn’s shoulders. He turned to Vivian with a smug, I knew it expression, his voice dripping with cold disdain.

"What’s your game? Why are you deliberately targeting her? Vivian, don’t pretend you didn’t know she’s my girlfriend."

The crowd erupted in silent glee, mentally cheering for the unfolding drama.

Did his brain short-circuit again? Wait—oh no. Did he seriously think Vivian was using another man’s photo to provoke him? And now he’s dragging Gwendolyn into this mess? Good grief, who let this man’s imagination run wild? If he wanted a sidekick, shouldn’t he have picked Lila? Oh, right—he thinks Vivian is picking on Gwendolyn, so involving her makes his little act more convincing. Unbelievable. I don’t know whether to call him clever or an idiot, but he’s got everything wrong! Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose.

The sudden shift in tension had everyone on edge. After all, they all assumed Vivian had finally reached her limit and was about to confront her replacement.

Meanwhile, Grayson was busy fanning the flames by using his rebound as a shield.

The era where only the substitutes and rebounds suffered had finally arrived.

When Nathan heard Evelyn's thoughts, he couldn't help but cringe on behalf of his friend.

Vivian stood frozen, utterly baffled by Grayson's words.


She wasn’t one to back down. Without hesitation, she snapped, "Grayson, have you lost your damn mind? First of all, I’m not targeting anyone. Second, isn’t Lila your girlfriend right now? I saw you two holding hands earlier. How could it possibly be this lovely lady? You two are clearly teaming up against her."

Regaining her composure, Gwendolyn swiftly stepped away from Grayson’s outstretched arm as if avoiding a plague. She put three deliberate steps between them, making it abundantly clear that there was no connection whatsoever between them.

Beatrice shot a sharp glance and immediately came to her friend’s defense. "The cocktail she ordered is typically served with lemon in our country, but not overseas. She must have forgotten to mention it when ordering. She’s allergic to lemons, you see."

Gwendolyn, who had been momentarily stunned, now stood frozen in disbelief. Her eyes flickered with something unreadable—confusion, perhaps, or gratitude. She opened her mouth to speak but bit back her words, choosing silence instead.

Vivian, ever the playful one, grinned and suggested, "How about you get me another one without lemon? But don’t waste this one—I think you’ll like it. It’s on me."

"Alright. I’ll prepare a fresh one for you right away. Though, I can’t drink while on duty. I’ll save it for after my shift. Thank you, Ms. Moore," Gwendolyn replied politely.

"Don’t call me Ms. Moore. Call me Vivian," she said warmly.

Even Beatrice could sense that Vivian had taken an instant liking to Gwendolyn.

The murmurs in the crowd grew louder, disappointment evident as the anticipated confrontation fizzled out, proving the rumors false.

As Vivian and Gwendolyn chatted amiably, Grayson—who had been ready for a fight mere moments ago—now stood like an irrelevant background prop, completely ignored by everyone.

###Chapter 249 Never Learn From Mistakes
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her latte, scrolling absently through her phone, when a familiar voice echoed in her mind—sharp, venomous, and unmistakably Victoria Hayes'.

"If only that insufferable Evelyn would disappear, Nathan would finally see me as more than just his secretary."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. She hadn’t meant to pry, but ever since that bizarre incident at the gala, she’d been catching fragments of people’s unfiltered thoughts—especially those about her. And Victoria’s? They were particularly… illuminating.

"She doesn’t deserve him. All those late nights working together, the way he looks at me when he thinks no one’s watching…"

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup. Nathan Blackwood, her fiancé, had always been professional with Victoria. But now, doubts slithered in. Had she missed something?

Her phone buzzed—a message from Lillian Graves, her assistant: "Heads up, Ms. Sinclair. Victoria just scheduled a ‘private meeting’ with Mr. Blackwood. His calendar says ‘urgent project review,’ but… well, you know how she operates."

Evelyn’s lips curled. Oh, she did. And thanks to her newfound… ability, she’d know exactly what Victoria was plotting.

Nathan’s office was all sleek lines and muted tones, the epitome of controlled power. When Evelyn strode in unannounced, Victoria’s saccharine smile faltered.

“Evelyn! What a surprise.” Her thoughts, however, screeched like nails on a chalkboard: "Ugh, of course she’d show up now. Can’t she take a hint?"

Nathan looked up, his storm-gray eyes warming. “Darling, I didn’t expect you.”

“I wanted to discuss the wedding seating chart,” Evelyn lied smoothly, perching on the edge of his desk. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched Victoria’s fingers twitch.

"Wedding. As if I’ll let that happen."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Oh, this was going to be fun.

That evening, at the Blackwood family dinner, Nathan’s sister Sophia leaned in. “You’re unusually quiet.”

Evelyn swirled her wine. “Just thinking about how… loyal people can surprise you.”

Across the table, Victoria stiffened.

"Does she know? No, she can’t. Unless…"

Evelyn smirked into her glass. The game was on.

Grayson knew all too well about Vivian's lemon allergy. Though it had been years, the memory remained sharp in his mind. Yet today, his thoughts were so clouded that he completely overlooked the citrus garnish in her drink.

The realization hit him like a slap—frustration and embarrassment coiled tight in his chest.

But Vivian had always been this way—unapologetically bold, even after their messy breakup. Grayson still convinced himself she only flirted with other men in front of him to provoke jealousy.

Truthfully, he had no idea this was simply Vivian’s nature abroad. Back home, he’d been her only serious relationship. After their split, she left the country, leaving him no chance to witness her infamous carefree lifestyle firsthand.

To Vivian, breakups meant clean cuts. Lingering awkwardness in the same social circles? Unthinkable.

Her reputation overseas was legendary. At one party, a dozen exes could mingle without a hint of tension.

Yet Grayson, whether out of pride or sheer delusion, refused to see reason. Even now, Vivian wouldn’t bend. Her stubbornness infuriated him. If we ever marry, she’ll have to change.

Not that he was any better. His temper had driven her away in the first place—no pleading, just curses as she boarded her flight.

So, faced with this standoff, Grayson defaulted to his usual tactic: brute force. Who would crack first?

He snapped his fingers at Gwendolyn, who was mid-pour replacing Vivian’s drink. "Leave that. Come here."

Every head turned. Beside him, Lila’s face twisted with barely contained rage—not at Grayson, but at Gwendolyn, her glare promising violence if the woman dared obey.

Evelyn nearly scoffed. Still playing the tyrant? After Gwendolyn’s blatant avoidance and his lies exposed, how could he still command her like some loyal subject? Was this the unshakable arrogance of silver-spooned heirs—living in a bubble where the world bent to their whims?

Pathetic. Lila, practically vibrating with jealousy, stood right there. She’d happily play along with his charade. But no—Grayson had to double down on delusion, convinced Gwendolyn held some lingering softness for him.

Nathan watched his friend’s self-destruction with detached amusement. Some lessons, it seemed, could never be learned.

And Grayson? He was determined to fail spectacularly. Again.

Gwendolyn Brooks nearly rolled her eyes at Grayson Hart's ridiculous demand. This man really thinks he's the stereotypical arrogant CEO from some cheesy romance novel?

Yet, she maintained her professional facade, not wanting to cause a scene at the party. "Sir, I'm currently assigned to Ms. Sinclair's service. If you require assistance, I can call another staff member for you."

Grayson's eyes darkened in disbelief. He hadn’t expected Gwendolyn—of all people—to defy him so blatantly. It was one thing for Vivian Moore to challenge him, but for his former assistant to do the same? Unacceptable.

Is she still upset because she realized I planned to use her to provoke Vivian earlier? His jaw tightened. Well, I don’t care!

"Gwendolyn," he bit out, voice laced with warning, "my patience is wearing thin. Remember your place and come here now."

Gwendolyn forced a polite smile, though her fingers clenched around the tray she carried. "Sir, I'm just a service staff member tonight. Please don’t make this difficult for me."

Unbelievable. She gritted her teeth internally. I left his company months ago, yet he still acts like he owns me. He knows exactly who I am—this isn’t some mistaken identity drama. If he had approached me professionally for a paid performance, fine. But expecting free labor? Even corporate sharks have more shame.

Grayson’s expression twisted in fury. He couldn’t control Vivian, but now Gwendolyn was refusing to obey? The world had truly gone mad.

Nearby, Lila Carter watched with growing irritation. This party was supposed to be her night—hosted by Grayson in her honor. Yet, both Vivian and Gwendolyn had stolen his attention.

If Gwendolyn had complied, Lila might have simmered quietly. But the outright rejection? That was an insult.

I may not be able to compete with Vivian, but I’m certainly above some ex-assistant.

Before anyone could react, Lila snatched the wine glass from Gwendolyn’s tray—and flung its contents directly into her face.

The liquid splashed across Gwendolyn’s blouse, staining the fabric. Lila smirked, satisfied.

Grayson stiffened, instinctively stepping forward—then stopped himself. She brought this on herself. Maybe humiliation will remind her who she really is.

Gwendolyn’s breath hitched, her hands trembling—not from shock, but from the effort to restrain herself.

Lila sneered. "Mr. Hart showed you kindness, and this is how you repay him? Know your place."

Gwendolyn’s nails dug into her palms. Oh, I’ll show you exactly where my place is.

The words dripped with venom as Lila Carter sneered, her manicured fingers tightening around the wine glass. "You should take a good look at yourself in the mirror. Who do you even think you are?" Her voice was sharp enough to cut glass. "In front of us, you're nothing. Less than nothing—just a speck of dust beneath our shoes."

Gwendolyn Brooks flinched, her hands trembling at her sides. She had dealt with difficult people before, but never someone as vicious as Lila.

Lila leaned in, her smirk widening. "Did you really think just because Grayson used to spoil you, you could act like you belong here? Pathetic." She scoffed. "You're still just a servant. Know your place."

Before Gwendolyn could react, Lila tipped her glass, sending red wine cascading down the front of Gwendolyn's blouse. The liquid spread in dark, ugly stains, and Gwendolyn's eyes welled up instantly.

Evelyn Sinclair was on her feet in an instant, shoving a napkin into Gwendolyn's hands.

Vivian Moore, however, moved faster. She stepped between them and shoved Lila back with enough force to make her stumble.

"If you're that desperate for attention, go find it somewhere else," Vivian snapped, her voice icy. "Did Grayson rejecting you really make you this pathetic?"

Lila's face twisted in fury, but before she could retaliate, Evelyn cut in.

"Enough." Her tone was calm but carried an edge that silenced the room. "You’ve made your point. Now leave before you embarrass yourself further."

Lila's lips curled, but she hesitated—Evelyn’s gaze was unreadable, dangerous.

A beat passed.

Then, with a scoff, Lila turned on her heel and stormed off, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Gwendolyn wiped at her eyes, her breath shaky. "I-I'm sorry—"

"Don't apologize," Evelyn said firmly. "She's the one who should be ashamed."

Vivian crossed her arms, watching Lila disappear into the crowd. "Some people never learn."

And in that moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension—because if Lila thought this was over, she was sorely mistaken.
###Chapter 250: Mind Games and Juicy Revelations

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her coffee, scrolling through her phone. The tabloids were buzzing—another scandal involving Harrison Montgomery and his mistress, Vanessa Sterling. Evelyn smirked. Oh, Natalie Whitaker must be fuming.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

"You won’t believe what just dropped. Seraphina Delacroix was spotted leaving Sebastian Hart’s penthouse at 3 AM. And guess who else was there? Adrian Cross."

Evelyn’s perfectly manicured fingers flew across the screen. "Send me the photos. Now."

Within seconds, her screen flooded with blurry but damning images—Seraphina, wrapped in Adrian’s jacket, sneaking out of Sebastian’s building. The entertainment world was about to implode.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the chime of the elevator. Nathan Blackwood strode in, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His sharp gaze landed on her phone.

"Reading gossip again?" His voice was laced with amusement.

Evelyn tilted her head, flashing him a knowing smile. "Not just gossip, darling. Leverage."

Nathan arched a brow. "Do I even want to know?"

She leaned back, crossing her legs. "Seraphina’s playing both Adrian and Sebastian. If this gets out, her career is toast."

Nathan exhaled, shaking his head. "You enjoy this too much."

"Someone has to keep Hollywood interesting," she purred.

His phone vibrated—a message from Marcus Donovan, his brother Julian’s agent. Nathan’s expression darkened.

Evelyn caught the shift instantly. "Problem?"

"Julian’s being blackmailed. Someone has photos of him and Genevieve at that private club."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "Who?"

"Vincent Holloway."

She scoffed. "That playboy? Please. He’s all bark."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Not this time. He’s demanding Julian drop out of Preston Whitmore’s film."

Evelyn’s mind raced. This wasn’t just about Julian—this was about Nathan. Vincent had always resented the Blackwoods.

She stood, smoothing her dress. "Tell Julian not to panic. I’ll handle Vincent."

Nathan caught her wrist. "Evelyn—"

She smirked. "Relax. I have dirt on him too."

His grip loosened, but his eyes remained wary. "Be careful."

Evelyn winked. "Always."

As she strode out, her phone buzzed again—another message from Lillian.

"Breaking: Vanessa Sterling just announced she’s pregnant. Harrison’s name is all over it."

Evelyn’s grin widened. Oh, this was going to be delicious.

For the first time in her life, Lila felt the sting of humiliation. Tears welled up in her eyes as she glared at Vivian. "You're insane! Can't you see what this witch is trying to do?"

Vivian smirked, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Oh, I see exactly what you're trying to do. You wanted to dump that wine on me, didn’t you?"

Under Vivian’s piercing stare, Lila’s heart skipped a beat.

She had wanted to—desperately—but she hadn’t dared. Instead, she and Grayson had taken the coward’s route, using Gwendolyn as their scapegoat. After all, tormenting Gwendolyn came with no consequences.

Noticing Lila’s guilt, Vivian didn’t hesitate. "Apologize."

"What?" Lila gasped.

"Apologize to her. What’s the matter? Do you need me to spell it out for you?" Vivian crossed her arms, radiating an aura of unshakable authority.

Gwendolyn looked up at Vivian in shock, her eyes widening at the sight of Vivian’s unwavering stance. For the first time in ages, she felt protected.

Cornered by Vivian’s dominance and the judgmental stares of the onlookers, Lila couldn’t take it anymore. She turned to Grayson, her lower lip trembling.

Grayson, however, was baffled. Why was Vivian defending Gwendolyn again? Seeing Lila on the verge of tears, his frown deepened.

"Must you always be so dramatic?" Grayson said, irritation lacing his voice. "It’s just a minor incident."

The moment the words left his lips, Gwendolyn’s head snapped up, her eyes locking onto his.

A pang of guilt twisted in Grayson’s chest, and he quickly averted his gaze. Did I hurt her? But then, he steeled himself. It’s her own fault for being difficult. Besides, she’s nothing compared to Lila in status.

Standing beside Gwendolyn, Evelyn could practically feel the resentment rolling off her. She mentally cursed Grayson.

Before this moment, Evelyn hadn’t thought much of Grayson’s behavior. Sure, he was arrogant and delusional, but she’d dismissed him as harmless. Now, though? His words revealed his true colors.

Even if Grayson could afford to offend Lila without repercussions, his hierarchy of values was crystal clear. He might have some feelings for Gwendolyn, but deep down, he still looked down on those without status.

Because hurting her has no consequences, he doesn’t care. Defending her would only bring him trouble.

The realization made Evelyn’s blood boil. The gap between their morals is staggering.

Then, in the midst of her fury, a stray thought slipped out. Nathan would never be like this.

Nathan, who had been silently listening to Evelyn’s mental tirade, froze at the sudden compliment. His thoughts short-circuited, warmth flooding his chest.

Of course, Evelyn would be the only one thinking about me in the middle of all this chaos.

Meanwhile, the tension in the room thickened, the air crackling with unspoken accusations.

Hearing Grayson's reply, Vivian was so furious she let out a bitter laugh.

With a careless shrug, she said, "I'm actually relieved we broke up back then. I always knew we weren't meant to be."

That struck a nerve. Grayson's expression darkened. "Vivian, you—"

"Save it. This has nothing to do with you," Vivian cut him off sharply.

Grayson trembled with barely suppressed rage.

Done with him, Vivian turned to Lila with visible irritation. "When you're in the wrong, you should own up to it. Why are you hiding like I'm the one bullying you?"

"Vivian, don't push it."

"So you can bully others, but they can't stand up to you?" Vivian scoffed. "And let’s be clear—this isn’t bullying. This is justice."

Unable to hold back any longer, Lila snapped, "Vivian, are you blind or just playing dumb? She’s your stand-in, a cheap imitation trying to take your place. Why are you even defending someone like her? Don’t you see how she’s been using her resemblance to you to cling to Mr. Hart? How else would a nobody like her stay by his side for so long? You should be punishing her, not protecting her!"

Vivian fell silent, her gaze shifting to Gwendolyn.

Though it was an open secret, hearing it laid bare was painfully awkward. Under Vivian’s scrutiny, Gwendolyn stiffened. A surge of emotion welled up inside her—she didn’t want Vivian to dislike her, but she understood. Anyone would despise their own doppelgänger.

She braced herself, expecting Vivian to at least slap her.

What she didn’t expect was kindness.

Yet, a part of her mourned the possibility of friendship. They looked alike, and Vivian had been so warm toward her. Gwendolyn had even admired her, feeling an inexplicable pull. In another life, maybe they could’ve been close.

After losing her parents, Gwendolyn had never longed for family—until she met Vivian.

"I—I never meant to replace you," Gwendolyn stammered. "And I certainly wasn’t trying to seduce anyone. I just…"

If not for the NDA, she would’ve screamed the truth: I was hired by Grayson!

But she couldn’t.

And Evelyn, who was supposed to know nothing, couldn’t help her either.

The real villain here is Grayson. He paid for this charade but acts like it never happened. Disgusting. Evelyn sighed. I just hope Vivian doesn’t misunderstand Gwendolyn.

Vivian studied her, then smiled wryly. "True or not, my advice? Pick someone else. This man isn’t worth it."

Evelyn smirked. God, I love Vivian’s attitude.

Because honestly?

Grayson wasn’t worth it.

The moment those words left Vivian's lips, the entire room fell into stunned silence. It sounded as though she disapproved of her best friend's boyfriend and was fabricating lies to convince her to end things with him. Wasn't she supposed to be at odds with Gwendolyn?

At first, Vivian had simply assumed Grayson had a preference for women who resembled her, dismissing Gwendolyn's similarities as mere coincidence. But after observing the way Grayson and Lila interacted with Gwendolyn, doubt began to creep into her mind.

When Lila finally spilled the details, everything clicked into place for Vivian.

Yet, she still wasn’t entirely sure about Gwendolyn’s feelings toward Grayson. In moments like these, she always trusted her gut. And since she genuinely liked Gwendolyn, she made up her mind to shield her from any unnecessary drama.

"Oh, absolutely, you're completely right," Gwendolyn stammered, clearly caught off guard—likely because she had never been in such a bizarre situation before. "But I swear, there’s absolutely nothing between us right now!"

A satisfied smirk curled on Vivian’s lips.

The exchange between Vivian and Gwendolyn left Grayson flustered. No one had anticipated that the two women would team up to embarrass him.

"Vivian, Gwendolyn, you two—"

Finally realizing they’re working together, huh? Isabelle smirked to herself.

Vivian shot Grayson a sharp glare, cutting him off mid-sentence. "Why are you even talking? Can’t you, as a man, stay out of women’s business for once? It’s beyond annoying."

With that, she turned her piercing gaze back to Lila. "Your turn."

Lila, now fully aware of Grayson’s unreliability, took an involuntary step back, her face paling in shock.

###Chapter 251 Standing By His Woman

The tension in the room was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathan Blackwood’s penthouse, her fingers tracing the condensation on the glass. Outside, the city lights flickered like distant stars, but her mind was far from serene.

Nathan’s voice, low and measured, broke the silence. "You knew this would happen, Evelyn."

She turned to face him, her emerald eyes flashing with defiance. "I didn’t know anything, Nathan. You’re the one who kept secrets."

His jaw tightened, the muscle ticking beneath his stubble. "Secrets? Or necessary precautions?"

Evelyn scoffed, crossing her arms. "Oh, please. You don’t get to play the martyr here. Not after what you did."

Before Nathan could retort, the door burst open, and Victoria Hayes stormed in, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "Well, isn’t this cozy?" she drawled, her crimson lips curling into a smirk.

Evelyn’s spine stiffened. "What do you want, Victoria?"

Victoria’s gaze flicked between them, amusement dancing in her cold eyes. "Just thought I’d check in. After all, the whole company is buzzing about your little… disagreement."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "This doesn’t concern you."

"Oh, but it does," Victoria purred, stepping closer. "Especially when it affects my projects."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed in her pocket. A glance at the screen made her breath hitch—Serena Whitmore’s name flashed with an urgent message: "They’ve moved up the deadline. We need to act now."

Nathan noticed her reaction. "Problem?"

She slipped the phone back into her pocket, forcing calm into her voice. "Nothing I can’t handle."

Victoria laughed, a sharp, mocking sound. "Oh, this is rich. The great Evelyn Sinclair, scrambling to keep up."

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Get out, Victoria."

Victoria feigned offense, pressing a hand to her chest. "Such hostility. Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you." With a final smirk, she sauntered out, leaving the air thick with unresolved tension.

Nathan exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "We need to talk."

Evelyn shook her head. "No. What we need is to focus on damage control before this spirals out of hand."

His eyes bore into hers, unyielding. "And what if it already has?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implications. Evelyn’s pulse quickened. She had no answer—only the gnawing certainty that the game had just gotten far more dangerous.

Somewhere in the city, unseen forces were moving. And if they didn’t act fast, everything they’d built would crumble.

Across the room, Grayson found himself utterly disarmed by Vivian's sharp retort, savoring the bittersweet torment she inflicted. His attention had completely abandoned Lila—proof that Vivian remained his greatest weakness.

No wonder Grayson couldn't shake her from his thoughts. Men never easily release what they can't conquer. It's not always love—sometimes it's the unattainable that lingers most. As for Lila? She'd brought this upon herself. Had she not provoked the storm, she wouldn't be drowning in its aftermath.

Evelyn arched a brow, refusing to let Vivian bear the battle alone.

"Speaking of which," Evelyn cut in sharply, "we haven't settled our earlier matter. Ms. Carter, you attempted to drag an innocent through the mud without cause. Don't you owe her an apology? We're all equals here—no crowns, no thrones. Surely someone raised with manners understands basic decency?" Her gaze hardened. "Two offenses. One apology."

Lila hadn't anticipated this second adversary shattering her plans. For the first time, she tasted the metallic sting of being cornered. Her glare at Gwendolyn burned with indignant fury.

While Vivian and Evelyn were forces she couldn't challenge, it baffled her that they'd champion some lowly service girl over her.

"So what if I nudged her?" Lila scoffed, chin lifted. "And the wine? Spilled liquid, not blood. I'll compensate her—name your price." The words dripped with condescension. She'd rather walk through fire than apologize to such beneath her.

Gwendolyn straightened under Evelyn and Vivian's protective stance. Though fear of powerful retaliation still coiled in her stomach, she wouldn't dishonor their defense by caving.

"I don't want your money," Gwendolyn declared, voice steady.

"You—!" Lila's composure cracked. "Don't test me!"

"She said no money," Vivian snapped. "Apologize. Now."

A hush fell over their corner of the room.

Lila's cheeks flamed scarlet, ears burning. Humiliation and rage boiled over. "You think she's worth my apology?"

With that, she spun toward escape—a tactical retreat when battles turn against you.

But wrongdoing never walks away unscathed.

Reading Evelyn's unspoken resolve, Nathan knew Lila wouldn't leave unchallenged.

"Lila!" Evelyn's voice rang out.

The woman turned—just in time for Evelyn to seize a wineglass and hurl its contents straight at her face.

The next moment, Evelyn let out a sharp gasp that cut through the air like shattered glass.

Silence.

Everyone froze. No one had ever witnessed Gwendolyn Brooks exhibit such raw power before. Then it hit them—rumors about the Sinclair family's unconventional heiress weren't exaggerated after all.

Sidelong glances darted toward Nathan Blackwood, anticipating outrage. Instead, his expression remained unreadable, as if this spectacle was entirely expected.

Vivian Moore caught on instantly and flashed Gwendolyn an approving grin.

Grayson Hart stood too close to Lila Carter. When the wine hit his face, his entire body jerked in shock.

Lila's scream dissolved into incoherent rage. "Have you lost your mind?" she shrieked, mascara bleeding down her cheeks.

"Just a spilled drink," Evelyn countered smoothly, echoing Lila's earlier dismissal. "Why the drama?"

"You're doing this for her?" Lila's voice cracked with disbelief.

Evelyn's lips curled. "I warned you. Touch my people, and you answer to me. Seems you enjoy learning things the hard way."

Lila's glare could've ignited the champagne tower.

"Got a problem?" Evelyn tilted her head toward Nathan. "Take it up with him."

The crowd held their breath. Defending a random fan was one thing, but provoking industry connections? Would the infamous Blackwood heir really indulge such recklessness?

Nathan gave a solemn nod. "Charge it to my account."

Jaws dropped.

Evelyn smirked. "Told you."

Lila exploded. "You're insane! Who do you think you are, meddling in—"

Nathan's voice turned arctic. "Care to repeat that?"

Lila shuddered but stood her ground. "Mr. Blackwood, surely you don't condone this? Your wife just assaulted me!"

"Assault?" Nathan arched a brow. "She was balancing the scales. You started this; she's finishing it."

Lila gaped, speechless.

Onlookers exchanged stunned glances. This wasn't the ruthless businessman they knew. Since when did Nathan Blackwood become the type to enable his wife's chaos without limits?

Yet the truth was undeniable—neither Lila nor Grayson held leverage against him. If the Blackwoods weren't afraid of burning bridges, who were they to object?

Many women present felt a pang of envy. They'd assumed Nathan's legendary indifference made him emotionally unavailable. Now? The man was rewriting the rules of devotion.

Nathan's inner circle barely blinked. They'd learned the pattern: whenever their friend acted out of character, Evelyn Sinclair was always the variable.

Tears streamed down Lila's wine-stained face as Grayson finally snapped out of his daze. His expression darkened—this mess threatened his precarious balance between Vivian and Gwendolyn.

"Enough," he growled, grabbing Lila's arm. "We're leaving."

Lila wrenched free. "You're choosing them over me? After everything?"

Grayson's patience snapped. "There was never a 'you and me.' Stop deluding yourself. Today's embarrassment is on you."

He walked away without a backward glance, leaving Lila trembling in his wake.

As the drama dissipated, the poolside ambiance lightened considerably.

"Thank you," Gwendolyn murmured, bowing to Vivian and Evelyn.

Vivian waved her off. "Save the formalities. Consider yourself under my protection now. Anyone messes with that face, they answer to me."

Evelyn was about to respond when she noticed something—angry red splotches marring Gwendolyn's neck. Not blushing. Not irritation.

Something far more concerning.

###Chapter 252 Half Sister

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathan Blackwood had already left for his early meeting, leaving only the faint scent of his cologne lingering in the air. She stretched, her muscles still humming from last night’s passionate encounter, and reached for her phone.

A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, popped up:

"The script revisions are in. Preston Whitmore wants to discuss them with you before noon. Also, Vanessa Sterling is making headlines again—something about a leaked video with Harrison Montgomery. The media is having a field day."

Evelyn groaned. Vanessa Sterling was nothing but trouble, and Harrison Montgomery’s marriage to Natalie Whitaker was already hanging by a thread. She typed back:

"Schedule the meeting with Preston. And keep me updated on the Harrison mess—Natalie doesn’t deserve this."

As she swung her legs off the bed, her gaze landed on the framed photo on the nightstand—Nathan and her at last year’s charity gala, his arm draped possessively around her waist. A smile tugged at her lips. Despite the chaos of their lives, he was her constant.

Her phone buzzed again—this time, an unknown number.

"You think you’ve won, Evelyn? The game has just begun."

Her blood ran cold. The message was unsigned, but the venom behind it was unmistakable. Victoria Hayes. Nathan’s scheming secretary, who had been quietly removed from Blackwood Industries after her attempts to sabotage Evelyn’s relationship with Nathan came to light.

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her phone. Victoria wasn’t one to make empty threats.

Before she could react, another notification flashed—this time from Nathan.

"Meeting ran late. Dinner tonight? I’ll make it worth your while."

The warmth in his words eased the tension in her shoulders. She typed back:

"Only if you promise no interruptions this time."

His reply was instant.

"No interruptions. Just you and me."

Evelyn exhaled, pushing Victoria’s threat to the back of her mind. Whatever game Victoria was playing, she wouldn’t let her win.

But as she headed to the shower, a nagging thought lingered—Victoria had resources. And if she was bold enough to reach out directly, she wasn’t acting alone.

The real question was: Who was backing her?

"Wait a minute. What's that on your neck?" Evelyn asked bluntly, her sharp gaze locking onto the faint red marks.

Vivian turned to look. The sight sent a jolt through her—it was eerily familiar.

Gwendolyn was already scratching at her skin, her discomfort obvious. "It's nothing. Just an allergic reaction. Excuse me."

With that, she hurried away.

"An allergy? To alcohol?" Vivian frowned. "She must have a sensitive constitution."

Evelyn found it odd too. In all their past gatherings, she had never seen Gwendolyn drink.

Instinctively, she activated her system for a quick scan.

Vivian returned to her old friends, venting about how Grayson had treated Gwendolyn as nothing more than a replacement—something she found utterly cruel and heartless.

The group exchanged uneasy glances. Grayson's behavior was despicable, but Vivian's reaction was... unexpectedly intense.

While lost in her system's data stream, Evelyn barely noticed Nathan rising from his seat. He guided her back down and gently wiped the spilled wine from her fingers with a napkin.

No way. This can't be a coincidence. Evelyn's eyes widened.

Nathan, long accustomed to Evelyn's racing thoughts, remained unfazed.

Both allergic to lemons. Nearly identical features. Could Vivian have a long-lost sister? Evelyn's brow furrowed. This feels like some cliché drama plot.

Even Nathan couldn't maintain his composure now. The mounting evidence made it impossible to dismiss as mere chance.

But he'd never heard of the Moore family losing any members. An illegitimate child? Vivian's parents adored her—their love story was legendary in high society.

As Nathan pondered, Evelyn dug deeper into her system.

She recalled the initial twist involving Sophia and Liam. Sometimes, if the truth was buried, the system required exhaustive searching to uncover it.

Earlier, when she'd scanned Gwendolyn and Vivian, she'd only skimmed surface details. Now, she scrutinized every piece of data.

Gwendolyn's records are straightforward. Parents died young in a car accident. No traceable relatives. Raised in an orphanage. She remembers her mother—looks just like her, so biological connection confirmed. But Vivian...

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Oh my god. Vivian's current mother isn't her biological one.

Nathan stiffened beside her, his mind racing to the same conclusion.

I see. This is absolutely outrageous. So, when Vivian was just a child, she witnessed her biological mother having an affair and running away with another man. She was so young, so desperate, clinging to her mother’s skirt, begging her not to leave. In a frantic moment, her mother shoved her away—hard—sending Vivian tumbling down the stairs. Even as she lay injured, bruised and bleeding, she still reached out, fingers trembling, trying to grasp her mother’s hand. But her mother, tears streaming down her face, whispered an apology and pulled away. Vivian could only watch, helpless, as her mother vanished into the night with her lover. The scars left behind weren’t just physical—they ran soul-deep. Evelyn’s expression darkened.

Nathan, noticing Evelyn’s simmering fury, glanced at Vivian—bright, vivacious, laughing without a care in the world. No one would ever guess the pain she carried.

No wonder the elder Moores had been furious, forcing Mr. Moore into a second marriage. They’d never approved of his first wife—Vivian’s mother—to begin with. He’d fought tooth and nail to marry her, only to be betrayed in the worst way. After that, his spirit shattered. He stopped resisting, stopped caring—his only concern was his daughter’s well-being. Hmm. It seemed he’d been reluctant about his new wife at first, given the circumstances. But then, unexpectedly, she turned out to be kind. She nursed Vivian back to health, cared for her like her own. In the end, Vivian accepted her stepmother before her father ever did—even calling her Mom. Yet, Mr. Moore still hadn’t moved on. He kept searching for Vivian’s birth mother—not because he wanted her back, but for closure.

Then, one day, he told Vivian her mother had died years ago. Would you like to visit her grave?

Vivian refused instantly. I only have one mother.

Meanwhile, her stepmother, out of love for her, had chosen never to have children of her own. Their bond was unbreakable. Vivian had long since buried the memory of her so-called real mother. Evelyn exhaled sharply, lost in thought.

Suddenly, Nathan had a realization. Earlier, when Gwendolyn had that allergic reaction, even Evelyn had spun wild theories. But Vivian? Not a single suspicion.

Was she subconsciously rejecting anything tied to her birth mother? Was her mind shielding her from the truth?

But this was Vivian—bold, fearless, sharp as a blade. Could she really be oblivious?

Meanwhile, the deeper Evelyn dug, the more uneasy she grew.

Both Vivian and Gwendolyn had lost their mothers. That alone was chilling.

Even if their mothers had different names… Gwendolyn’s age… The timeline of Vivian’s mother’s disappearance… Damn. The pieces fit. Was the universe really this cruel? Evelyn was so absorbed she barely registered the voices around her.

"Evelyn? Evelyn?" Vivian tilted her head, puzzled.

Nathan smirked. "She’s in her own world."

Vivian grinned. "Adorable. So this is your type, huh?"

"Doesn’t matter what she’s like. I’d love her anyway."

Vivian burst into laughter.

Evelyn ignored them. Because she’d just uncovered the truth.

Damn. They really were half-sisters—same mother, different fathers.

As Nathan chatted with Vivian, his gaze flickered. Then, slowly, he turned to Vivian, disbelief flashing in his eyes.

Vivian Moore let out a carefree laugh before suddenly turning serious. "By the way, that girl—Gwendolyn Brooks—is she really a fan of Evelyn Sinclair?"

Nathan Blackwood gave a slow nod.

"How old is she?" Vivian asked, her tone casual, though she avoided meeting Nathan’s gaze.

Nathan studied her for a moment, his brow creasing slightly. "I heard she just turned twenty."

Vivian’s lashes fluttered briefly before she schooled her expression.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had regained her composure and was eager to share the latest gossip with Nathan. But when she noticed Vivian standing unusually close to them, she froze, guilt flickering through her.

If this had been any other long-lost sibling situation, Evelyn would’ve gone out of her way to help them reconnect. But Vivian’s circumstances were… complicated.

After all, Vivian’s mother had cheated, abandoned her, and started a new family with her lover. Gwendolyn might be innocent, but Vivian was even more so.

Given the messy history, even though Vivian was known for her grace, Evelyn couldn’t predict how she’d react to Gwendolyn.

Vivian seemed to shake off whatever thoughts had troubled her, offering Evelyn a bright smile. "What’s on your mind?"

Evelyn fumbled for words. "Just wondering if things will get chaotic when Grayson Hart shows up later."

Vivian’s expression remained indifferent, as if Grayson’s name meant nothing to her.

After some light conversation, Vivian tugged Beatrice Holloway toward the pool for a swim. But her strokes were erratic, and she soon climbed out, restless.

"I need a drink. Where’s that girl? Why isn’t she here yet?" Vivian abruptly broke the silence. "Could it be a bad allergic reaction? I should check on her."

###Chapter 253 Tremors of Revelation

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across her marble countertop. As she sipped her lavender-infused latte, her phone buzzed with an incoming message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant.

"You won't believe what just happened," Lillian’s text read, followed by three fire emojis.

Evelyn’s perfectly manicured fingers tapped the screen. "Spill. Now."

A second later, her screen flooded with images—Seraphina Delacroix, the notorious second-tier actress, caught in a heated argument with Sebastian Hart outside a high-end restaurant. The paparazzi had captured every dramatic gesture, every flash of anger in Seraphina’s eyes.

Evelyn smirked. "Again? Didn’t they break up months ago?"

Lillian’s reply was instant. "Rumor has it she found out he’s been cozying up to Isabelle Laurent, his new manager. And guess who was spotted having lunch with Adrian Cross yesterday?"

Evelyn’s eyebrows shot up. Adrian Cross—Seraphina’s current boyfriend—was one of the hottest actors in the industry. If this got out, the tabloids would have a field day.

Before she could respond, another message popped up—this time from Preston Whitmore, the director she’d been working with on her latest film.

"Emergency meeting at noon. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. Preston’s "emergency meetings" usually meant one thing: drama. And she had a sinking feeling it involved the on-set tension between Donovan Sharpe, their temperamental producer, and Genevieve Blackwood, Nathan’s sharp-tongued sister, who had recently joined as an executive consultant.

Setting her phone down, Evelyn exhaled sharply. The entertainment world was a snake pit, and today, the snakes were particularly restless.

Just as she reached for her bag, her phone buzzed once more—a notification from a gossip blog. The headline made her choke on her latte.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman—Is Evelyn Sinclair Out of the Picture?"

Her grip tightened around her phone.

Oh, this was going to be a very interesting day.

As Vivian rose to depart, Evelyn stood frozen in shock. Though Gwendolyn had indeed caught Vivian's attention, it was peculiar for her to show such concern for someone she'd barely met.

Nathan observed Vivian's retreating figure before murmuring, "Perhaps Vivian suspects Gwendolyn is her half-sister—sharing the same mother."

The moment the words left his lips, Evelyn's face paled. She hadn't breathed a word of this secret to him. How could he possibly know?

Reading her expression, Nathan smirked and leaned in conspiratorially, beckoning her closer. Evelyn's eyes gleamed with intrigue. After all, Nathan was a man of influence—unearthing hidden truths was second nature to him.

Relieved she wasn't the sole keeper of this bombshell, Evelyn eagerly whispered, "What else do you know?"

Just as they were about to exchange secrets, Vivian, Marcus, and Beatrice arrived nearby, their lively chatter repeatedly interrupting the hushed conversation. Frustrated, Evelyn dragged Nathan toward the secluded edge of the pool, where the splashing water masked their whispers.

"Rumors say Vivian's current mother isn't her birth mother," Nathan revealed. "Her real mother allegedly ran off with another man. Given Gwendolyn's age, the timeline fits. I think Vivian's starting to suspect—hence her sudden interest."

Evelyn's face lit up. "If they are sisters, how do you think Vivian would treat her?"

Nathan pondered. "From what I've seen, Vivian fiercely protects those she cares about. And Gwendolyn lost her parents young. The root of Vivian's resentment is gone—she isn't the type to redirect hatred blindly. At the very least, she values loyalty."

But his confidence was thin. He barely knew most people here well enough to be certain.

Anxious, Evelyn discreetly checked on Gwendolyn through her system—and nearly cursed aloud. What the hell is Grayson doing? Is he harassing her again?

The pool water rippled as a beach ball floated past. Nathan batted it away, catching Evelyn's silent fury. What mess has my friend stirred up now?

After swallowing her medication and slipping into her crisp new uniform, Gwendolyn was ready to return to her duties when she found herself trapped in a dimly lit corridor.

The moment she spotted Grayson, irritation flared within her. She had intended to breeze past him without acknowledgment.

But as she brushed by, his hand shot out, slamming her against the cold wall, his grip unyielding. "Gwendolyn," he growled, his voice laced with venom, "since when did you grow so bold? Ignoring me now?"

She struggled futilely against his hold, frustration bubbling over. "Mr. Hart, the contract clearly states that once our agreement ended, you were to leave me alone. Or have you forgotten your own rules?"

That clause had been Grayson’s own doing—meant to control her. Yet now, it was he who couldn’t seem to abide by it.

A dark chuckle escaped him as he tilted her chin up, his thumb pressing into her skin. "You’ve been testing my patience lately. How much longer do you think I’ll tolerate this defiance?"

Gwendolyn’s lips twisted. How could someone as kind as Vivian ever have been involved with a man like him?

Her silence seemed to placate him momentarily. He exhaled, studying her lowered lashes and the defeated slump of her shoulders. This was the Gwendolyn he remembered—docile, compliant, always bending to his will.

In truth, he missed it. Missed how she used to orbit around him, eager to please.

His gaze lingered, throat bobbing. It had been too long since they’d last spoken. Surely, she must have missed him too. How many nights had she spent crying over him?

If not for Vivian… The thought struck him like a physical blow. Why did it have to be her? Even now, seeing Vivian again had stirred old emotions, but she was just as infuriating as ever. Why torment himself when he could have someone who adored him unconditionally? Someone like Gwendolyn.

Perhaps… he’d made the wrong choice.

"Gwendolyn," he murmured, voice uncharacteristically soft, "I know what you’re thinking. But I—I’m conflicted. Just give me some time."

She blinked, startled by the plea. A bitter laugh threatened to escape. "Mr. Hart, you don’t need time. There’s nothing between us. I swear on my life, I’ve never harbored feelings for you. Now, move. I have work to do."

If only he could believe that. But self-deception had always been his specialty.

"Gwendolyn," he breathed, eyes darkening, "I don’t think I’ve ever kissed you, have I?"

Her blood ran cold. Before she could react, he leaned in—only for a sharp voice to slice through the tension.

"Well, well. Forcing yourself on her now? Grayson, you never fail to disappoint."

Vivian’s voice.

Grayson recoiled as if burned, guilt flashing across his face before he could mask it.

Gwendolyn sagged against the wall, heart pounding.

The confrontation was far from over.

Gwendolyn stumbled backward as Grayson shoved her aside, nearly losing her balance. Anger flared within her, and before she could stop herself, she flipped him off with both hands, her glare sharp enough to cut glass.

Of course, Grayson was too preoccupied with Vivian to notice. His entire focus was locked onto his ex-girlfriend, his expression a mix of tension and something dangerously close to desperation. But Vivian—oh, Vivian saw it all.

A laugh escaped her, rich and unexpected, leaving Gwendolyn frozen in mortification. Heat rushed to her cheeks. Did she still have feelings for him? The question gnawed at her, unanswered.

Grayson, emboldened by Vivian’s presence, squared his shoulders. "What are you even doing here?" His voice dripped with false confidence. "My life isn’t your concern anymore. You lost that right when you walked away."

Meanwhile, Evelyn—observing through the system—rolled her eyes so hard it hurt. Even now, he’s still trying to use Gwendolyn to get under Vivian’s skin. Just moments ago, he’d been wallowing in self-pity. What a manipulative bastard.

Nathan, listening to Evelyn’s thoughts, wasn’t surprised. Grayson had been scheming this for years. No matter who else caught his attention, Vivian had always been his endgame.

If both Vivian and Gwendolyn actually fall for him, it’ll just be another tired love triangle where he’s the tortured hero. Evelyn’s frown deepened. Except right now, he’s the only one still playing his role—and he’s improvising extra drama for himself.

Vivian, however, had no patience left for Grayson’s theatrics. She waved him off dismissively. "Sure, whatever. Can you leave? I need to talk to Gwendolyn."

The air between them crackled—un business, unspoken words. But for now, Grayson had been dismissed. And Gwendolyn? She stood there, caught between two storms, unsure which one would swallow her whole.
###Chapter 254 Falling Hard
Eavesdropping on Juicy Secrets

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her plush velvet sofa, sipping her vanilla latte, when an unexpected thought flickered through her mind—Nathan Blackwood’s secretary, Victoria Hayes, is hiding something.

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink.

Since when could she hear other people’s thoughts?

She blinked, setting her cup down with a clatter. The voice—no, the thought—had been as clear as if someone had whispered it directly into her ear. But Victoria wasn’t even in the room. In fact, she was probably halfway across the city, scheming in her office at Blackwood Industries.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Was this some bizarre side effect of the stress she’d been under? Or had she finally cracked under the pressure of navigating high society’s cutthroat gossip mill?

Then it happened again.

If Nathan finds out about the embezzlement, I’m .

Evelyn’s breath hitched. That was definitely Victoria’s voice—sharp, calculated, laced with panic. But how?

A slow smirk curled her lips. If this was real—if she could actually pluck secrets straight from people’s minds—then the game had just changed.

And Evelyn Sinclair loved winning.

Down in the Blackwood Industries lobby, Victoria Hayes adjusted her blazer, her perfectly manicured nails tapping against her tablet. She had worked too hard, sacrificed too much, to let some upstart like Evelyn Sinclair ruin everything.

Little did she know, her most guarded secrets were no longer safe.

Not when Evelyn was listening.

Grayson's expression shifted instantly upon hearing the news, his brows knitting together in concern that Vivian might give Gwendolyn a hard time.

Yet, when he recalled how Vivian had only ever challenged Gwendolyn for his sake, an undeniable warmth curled in his chest—smug satisfaction he couldn’t quite suppress.

"Vivian," he drawled, tilting his chin up in that infuriatingly arrogant way of his, "I don’t appreciate your confrontational attitude. And since when do you hunt down my people?"

Vivian responded by flipping him off with both hands, her face an unreadable mask.

Grayson’s pulse spiked, irritation flaring—but beneath it, that same twisted satisfaction burned brighter. Then, from behind him, a soft, mocking laugh cut through the tension. He whirled around, but Gwendolyn had already schooled her features back into neutrality.

Stepping forward, Gwendolyn gestured gracefully toward the hall. "We have a private lounge this way. If you’d like to—"

Before Grayson could protest, Vivian was already striding off beside her, leaving him gaping in their wake.

"Gwendolyn!" he barked, voice sharp with disbelief. "Have you lost your damn mind? You—"

"Mr. Hart," she called over her shoulder, tone cool, "perhaps you should return to the party. You are the guest of honor, after all."

By the time he recovered enough to chase after them, the elevator doors had already slid shut.

Grayson stood there, utterly bewildered. What the hell just happened? This wasn’t how things were supposed to go. He should be there—what if Vivian decided to take a swing at her? How was he supposed to protect Gwendolyn if she kept walking away from him?

Frustration coiled tight in his chest, warring with something far more unsettling. He wanted to storm off, to leave her to deal with Vivian’s temper alone—but the thought of it made his stomach twist. The truth was, even now, he had no idea what he truly wanted.

Grinding his teeth, he stalked back to the party, scanning the crowd for Evelyn. If anyone could intervene, it was her. Vivian listened to her.

His gaze landed on Evelyn and Nathan in the pool, their eyes locked on him with identical, unreadable expressions.

Grayson marched over without preamble. "Hey, Evelyn. Your little admirer just got dragged off by Vivian for a chat. I’d bet my fortune she’s getting chewed out right now."

Evelyn’s lips parted, and for a second, Grayson thought she was hesitating—until Nathan’s smirk told him otherwise. He could practically hear the curses running through her mind.

"Actually," Evelyn said smoothly, "Vivian mentioned she and Gwen hit it off instantly. They’re planning to spend more time together."

Grayson scoffed. "You actually believe that?"

The way Nathan’s eyes gleamed told him he was missing something—something big. And Grayson hated being the last to know.

"Could you honestly believe Vivian would give Gwendolyn a hard time?" Evelyn's question hung in the air, her tone laced with amusement.

Grayson stiffened, his pride wounded by the implication. He opened his mouth to argue, but the sight of Evelyn's teasing smirk stopped him cold. "Don't flatter yourself," she added with a playful roll of her eyes. "You really think they're fighting over you? Please."

His jaw clenched. What the hell does that mean? If they weren’t fighting over him, then—what? Was he reading this all wrong?

He wanted to snap back, but the memory of past embarrassments made him hesitate. Still, stubbornness won out. "If you don’t know what’s going on, maybe keep your opinions to yourself."

Evelyn arched a brow, unimpressed. "Oh, I know enough. Face it—Vivian seems way more interested in Gwendolyn than in you. Right, darling?" She nudged Nathan, dragging him into the conversation for backup.

Predictably, Grayson shot Nathan a wary glance. Nathan, ever the supportive husband, nodded without hesitation. Because honestly? That’s exactly how it looked.

Grayson’s expression cracked. "Wait… you don’t think she’s actually—" He cut himself off, eyes widening as if struck by a sudden, horrifying realization.

Evelyn and Nathan exchanged a look.

Oh no. Evelyn’s thoughts raced. That’s not the kind of "like" I meant. Did he seriously jump to that conclusion?

Nathan barely suppressed a wince. For a second, he’d thought Grayson was going there too—but thankfully, the man seemed to catch himself.

Evelyn bit her lip. Right. Vivian did mention once that she wasn’t strictly into men. Said she might fall for a woman if the right one came along. But she’d never acted on it, so Grayson had dismissed the idea. Until now. The way Vivian looked at Gwendolyn was different. No wonder Grayson was spiraling.

Grayson, meanwhile, was mentally kicking himself. Even if Vivian’s into women, she wouldn’t go for someone who looks like her own reflection. That’s just… weird. He must’ve lost his mind for a second, thrown off by their oddly cozy dynamic.

He opened his mouth to argue further, but Evelyn had already lost interest. With a smirk, she grabbed Nathan’s hand and swam toward the center of the pool, leaving Grayson fuming in their wake.

Hoisting herself onto a giant float, Evelyn lounged lazily while Nathan stayed close, his hands resting on the edge beside her. Her mind, however, was still on the drama. I have to see how Vivian handles this.

Meanwhile, Gwendolyn had successfully steered Vivian away from Grayson’s chaos. Catching her breath, Gwendolyn finally relaxed—and, without thinking, blurted out her gratitude.

Vivian Moore arched an eyebrow, her voice dripping with amusement. "Seems my instincts were right. You're not exactly thrilled with how he's treating you."

Gwendolyn Brooks didn't hesitate. "Of course not."

A soft laugh escaped Vivian's lips. "Thank God. I was worried Grayson's idiocy might've made you resent me."

Gwendolyn immediately caught the reference—the whole stand-in fiasco. She scratched her cheek sheepishly. "Don't be mad at me, okay? I swear, I don’t have feelings for him."

"Good," Vivian exhaled dramatically. "Because if you did, I'd have to drag you to an optometrist first, then line up a hundred gorgeous men outside your door. That ought to fix your taste."

Gwendolyn burst out laughing.

Objectively, Vivian's comment was borderline inappropriate given their barely-there friendship. But she said it so effortlessly, and strangely, Gwendolyn didn’t mind.

"So," Vivian pressed, genuine curiosity in her tone, "why did you agree to be my replacement?"

Gwendolyn hesitated. Grayson had been a nightmare to deal with, and she was this close to breaking their agreement. But if she did, he’d demand compensation—money she’d already donated to the orphanage.

She couldn’t afford to piss off spoiled heirs, and she definitely wouldn’t crawl to Evelyn or Vivian for help just because they were nice to her. She had her pride. So she’d endured.

Before she could answer, Vivian’s eyes narrowed. "Was it about money?"

Gwendolyn stiffened—just for a second—but it was enough.

Vivian’s jaw clenched, but she kept her voice steady. "Was it your choice?"

No point lying. Gwendolyn nodded. It had been a job, nothing more.

In a way, Grayson’s absurd demands had helped her during a rough patch. That’s why she tolerated him—not just because of the contract, but because she owed him some gratitude.

Internally, Vivian was cursing Grayson to hell and back. But if Gwendolyn had done this for money, she must’ve been desperate. So Vivian swallowed her rage.

Then, tentatively, Gwendolyn spoke again. "So... Ms. Moore, you also don’t like—"

Vivian's perfectly arched eyebrow lifted in question. "What did you just call me?"

Gwendolyn instantly straightened under that piercing gaze, her fingers nervously smoothing her uniform skirt. "Vivian," she corrected softly, the name tasting strangely sweet on her tongue.

A secret thrill shot through Vivian at the sound. The corner of her lips twitched as she casually reached out, her manicured fingers brushing against Gwendolyn's shoulder. "You had something here," she murmured, holding up a single golden strand between them like a trophy.

The afternoon sunlight caught in Gwendolyn's wide eyes as she stared at the hair now coiled around Vivian's finger. Her breath hitched when Vivian didn't immediately let go, their fingers accidentally brushing as she pretended to examine the strand.

Somewhere in the bustling hotel lobby, a champagne flute shattered. Neither woman noticed.

###Chapter 255 Will Not Let Me Hug

The tension in the penthouse was suffocating. Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers gripping the edge of the marble countertop until her knuckles turned white. Outside, the city lights flickered like distant stars, indifferent to the storm brewing inside.

Nathan Blackwood’s voice cut through the silence like a blade. "You knew, didn’t you?"

Evelyn didn’t turn around. She couldn’t. Not when the weight of his accusation pressed against her chest like a leaden weight. "Knew what?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"That Victoria was behind the leaks." His footsteps echoed as he closed the distance between them. "You had the evidence, and you kept it from me."

She exhaled sharply, finally spinning to face him. His stormy gray eyes burned with betrayal, and for a moment, she faltered. "I was trying to protect you—"

"Protect me?" Nathan scoffed, running a hand through his dark hair. "Or were you protecting yourself?"

The accusation stung. Evelyn clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms. "You think I’d sabotage my own career just to—what? Play some twisted game?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "I don’t know what to think anymore. First the media scandal, then the board questioning my leadership—all because of information only a handful of people had access to."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "And you automatically assumed it was me?"

His silence was answer enough.

Evelyn’s heart hammered against her ribs. She had trusted him—had believed they were past this. But now, standing in the wreckage of their fragile trust, she realized how wrong she’d been.

"You should leave," she said, her voice hollow.

Nathan’s expression darkened. "Evelyn—"

"Now."

For a heartbeat, he looked like he might argue. Then, with a sharp nod, he turned on his heel and strode out, the door slamming shut behind him.

The moment he was gone, Evelyn’s knees buckled. She sank onto the couch, her breath coming in ragged gasps. On the coffee table, her phone buzzed—a message from Lillian Graves, her assistant.

"The press got wind of the board meeting. They’re calling for Nathan’s resignation."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. This wasn’t just about Victoria anymore. Someone was pulling strings, and if she didn’t act fast, Nathan’s empire—and everything they’d built—would crumble.

She grabbed her phone, fingers flying over the screen.

"Get me everything you have on Victoria Hayes. And find out who else had access to those files."

The game had changed. And this time, Evelyn wasn’t playing by anyone’s rules but her own.

"That's more like it," Vivian said, twirling the strand of hair between her fingers. "You don’t even need to ask. I lost interest in him ages ago. I’m a natural free spirit, falling for someone new every other week. It’s not that I don’t believe good people exist—I just don’t buy into 'forever.' Love, to me, is like a rare wine—best enjoyed at its peak. I want to be in love until my last breath. Why settle for just one?"

Gwendolyn was stunned. She had never met someone who lived by such a philosophy so unapologetically. If love is anything like what Grayson feels for Vivian, then I want no part of it. Vivian’s version sounded thrilling, but… "I think Ms. Sinclair and her husband are perfect together."

Vivian laughed, tapping Gwendolyn’s nose playfully. "I’m talking about normal people, darling. Nathan and that Marcus? They’re anomalies—absolute freaks of nature. Regular love burns bright, then fizzles out, leaving nothing but resentment behind. If you’re lucky, you might find a way to make it last longer."

Gwendolyn frowned slightly when Vivian called her idol’s husband a freak, but she recognized it as teasing between friends and let it slide. Still, she wondered why Vivian had brought this up so suddenly.

Vivian had grown restless as she spoke. Before, she’d had no real plan, just curiosity. But now that she was acting on it, she couldn’t stop. "Anyway, enough about that. Are you feeling better? Has the allergy passed?"

"Yeah, I’m fine now," Gwendolyn replied.

Vivian’s gaze sharpened. "You’re allergic to lemons, aren’t you?"

Gwendolyn’s pulse stuttered. "Uh, yeah. Funny coincidence, right?"

Too funny. If this were a soap opera, they’d probably be long-lost sisters. But Gwendolyn knew better—Vivian’s family was picture-perfect, and Gwendolyn had her own parents. Besides, she looked just like her mother, right down to the lemon allergy. The odds of some dramatic revelation were practically zero.

Still, Gwendolyn couldn’t help but wonder if fate had tied them together in some small way—maybe distant relatives, or a shared ancestor.

Vivian’s expression darkened with something unreadable. Without another word, she added Gwendolyn’s contact info and asked, "Do you still have to work?"

Gwendolyn nodded.

Vivian sighed dramatically. "If Grayson keeps bothering you, go to Evelyn. She’s kind, and she seems to like you. Plus, Grayson wouldn’t dare cross Nathan."

Gwendolyn blinked, warmth spreading through her at the protective tone. "Aren’t you coming?"

Vivian smirked. "I’ll catch up. I’ve got something to take care of first."

Gwendolyn hesitated, wanting to ask but not daring to pry.

With that, they headed downstairs. Vivian flagged a cab immediately, dialing a number as she slid into the backseat. She needed a DNA test—now.

After the encounter, Vivian Moore made a call to dig deeper into Gwendolyn Brooks' background. Only those close to Grayson Hart knew the truth about Gwendolyn—after all, it was Grayson who had brought her into the fold.

Naturally, someone from Grayson's inner circle tipped him off.

That person even suggested Vivian still harbored feelings for Grayson, given how intently she was investigating her supposed "replacement." To them, it seemed like Vivian saw Gwendolyn as a threat.

For a fleeting moment, Grayson hesitated as he watched Gwendolyn return.

Gwendolyn's background was painfully simple—hardly worth such scrutiny. Knowing Vivian as he did, she wasn’t the type to overreact to a mere "romantic rival."

Unless… A ridiculous thought flickered through Grayson’s mind. Is Vivian investigating Gwendolyn because she’s actually interested in her? He quickly dismissed the absurd notion.

Yet when he saw the troubled expression on Gwendolyn’s face, his suspicions flared. Vivian had made a move.

Grayson’s chest tightened with unease. He wasn’t ready to let Gwendolyn go. But then… what about Vivian?

Unable to resist, he strode toward Gwendolyn.

The moment she spotted him, her entire body stiffened as if facing a predator. She turned sharply to leave, but his voice stopped her.

When she turned back, her smile was strained.

Grayson mistook it for distress. "Did she upset you?"

"No."

"Stubborn as always."

Gwendolyn bit back a curse.

"If you’re upset, tell me. I’ll talk to her. Where is she?" Grayson frowned, realizing Vivian hadn’t returned.

"Vivian had to leave for personal reasons. And for the record, we get along just fine. Stop imagining drama where there isn’t any." If she could, Gwendolyn would shake him by the shoulders until sense rattled into him.

Grayson stopped listening the moment he heard Vivian was gone. His expression darkened, and without another word, he turned on his heel.

Unbelievable. He couldn’t bring himself to cut ties with Gwendolyn, yet the moment Vivian left, regret clawed at him. Was he determined to torture himself over this impossible choice?

If only he knew neither of them wanted him in the first place, Evelyn Sinclair thought with a sigh.

Nathan Blackwood, too, found Grayson’s indecision baffling.

Meanwhile, Grayson stormed off to make a call.

Vivian Moore, anxiously awaiting the results, couldn't be bothered to answer Grayson Hart's call.

Done.

Grayson sensed Vivian was genuinely upset—likely because she'd heard about his recent time with Gwendolyn Brooks.

If that was the case, he regretted diverting his attention to Gwendolyn. After all, Vivian was the woman he'd loved for years.

Disheartened, Grayson wandered off to a quiet corner to brood over his choices.

Seems like both Grayson and Vivian are waiting for something. Will this end today? Evelyn Sinclair mused, bored out of her mind.

She floated lazily on a pool ring when suddenly—splash!—a competitive dive sent waves crashing over her, flipping her into the water.

But she didn’t choke. Nathan Blackwood’s arms wrapped around her instantly, pulling her to the pool’s edge.

Evelyn’s head spun for a second before clarity returned.

Just as Nathan leaned in to ask if she was okay, she spoke first.

The way he holds me—his strength, the firm press of his muscles—it’s incredible! I got so distracted by the drama earlier, I almost forgot why I came today. A slow grin spread across her lips.

Nathan exhaled sharply, torn between amusement and exasperation.

Though his muscles tensed, his grip around her subtly tightened.

This was the closest they’d ever been.

Only the thin fabric of Evelyn’s swimsuit separated their bare skin. Their body heat, distinct from the cool pool water, seeped into each other.

Unaware they’d already reached the edge, Evelyn melted into his embrace. The strange sense of safety and comfort made her reluctant to move.

Nathan, too, couldn’t bring himself to let go. The woman in his arms had filled the hollow ache in his chest. He wished time would freeze.

They stayed like that, silent, lost in each other—until Nathan’s expression abruptly darkened. He pushed her away.

Evelyn, nearly dozing off, jolted awake with a scowl. "What’s wrong? Can’t I even get a hug?" He claims he likes me, yet he won’t hold me.

###Chapter 256 Such A Request
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her espresso, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp air, as her phone buzzed incessantly with notifications.

A smirk curled her lips as she scrolled through the latest tabloid headlines. "Seraphina Delacroix Caught in Love Triangle with Sebastian Hart and Adrian Cross!" The accompanying photos showed the second-tier actress in a heated argument with her ex, Sebastian, while her current flame, Adrian, stood frozen in the background.

Evelyn’s mind raced with the unspoken drama behind the images. Oh, Seraphina, darling, you always did have a flair for chaos. She could practically hear the woman’s frantic inner monologue—Why did Sebastian have to show up now? Adrian’s going to dump me, I just know it!—and the mental image made her chuckle.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, breezed in with a tablet. "You’re in a good mood," she remarked, eyeing Evelyn’s amused expression.

"Entertainment news," Evelyn replied, waving her phone. "It’s better than reality TV."

Lillian arched a brow. "Speaking of drama, Nathan Blackwood’s office just called. His secretary, Victoria Hayes, insisted on confirming your lunch meeting today."

Evelyn’s smirk deepened. Ah, Victoria. Still pretending she isn’t desperately in love with Nathan. She could practically hear the woman’s internal meltdown—Why does he always prioritize her? I’ve been by his side for years!—and it was delicious.

"Tell her not to worry," Evelyn said airily. "I wouldn’t dream of monopolizing his time." At least, not in front of her.

Lillian snorted. "You’re evil."

"Observant," Evelyn corrected. She stretched, her silk robe slipping slightly off one shoulder. "Now, let’s see what other juicy thoughts I can uncover today."

As she scrolled further, another headline caught her eye: "Harrison Montgomery Spotted with Vanessa Sterling Amidst Divorce Rumors!"

Evelyn’s grin turned predatory. Oh, Natalie Whitaker must be seething. She could already imagine the woman’s mental tirade—After everything I’ve done for him, this is how he repays me?—and it was exquisite.

Lillian sighed. "You’re enjoying this a little too much."

Evelyn winked. "Darling, in a world full of secrets, someone has to listen."

And with that, she leaned back, ready to devour the next scandal.

Nathan's cheeks flushed crimson as he stammered out an excuse, "I—I noticed you were dozing off and worried you might catch a chill."

He then added in a hushed whisper, "You can hold me all you want when we get back."

Evelyn blinked, snapping out of her daze, suddenly feeling self-conscious. Since when did I think I could just cling to him whenever I pleased?

As usual, she swiftly deflected. "You're right, I might get sick. I should head up now."

Nathan didn’t mind her deflection. Truthfully, he wasn’t in any state to linger either.

Just a brief embrace from his wife had sent heat coursing through him, leaving him restless and tense. He’d thought he’d grown accustomed to her presence, but their closeness still unraveled his control.

The unfamiliar surge of desire left him mortified, as if he’d committed something shameful. Terrified Evelyn might notice, he had no choice but to retreat hastily.

Thankfully, he regained his composure soon enough.

When Evelyn returned to the lounge, she found everything arranged perfectly—no staff assistance needed. Nathan had ensured she could recline comfortably without lifting a finger.

Meanwhile, the others were questioning Deborah about Vivian’s sudden disappearance.

With Vivian unreachable, the conversation inevitably veered toward scandalous rumors—speculations of a love triangle.

Gwendolyn, likely wary of drawing suspicion, had kept her distance while Nathan and Evelyn were by the pool. Only after they left did she resume serving other guests.

The shift in everyone’s gazes didn’t escape her, but Gwendolyn remained unfazed. She focused solely on her duties, offering no unnecessary words.

Though Evelyn and Nathan knew the truth, they couldn’t reveal that Vivian was handling a critical matter.

Still, they already knew the outcome.

Just then, Grayson returned.

His expression was uncharacteristically grave as he immediately sought out Gwendolyn, intent on pulling her aside.

"Hey—" Evelyn couldn’t help but interject.

"It’s private. Stay out of it." Grayson’s tone was firm but not impatient, catching Evelyn off guard.

Gwendolyn rarely saw him this serious. After a brief hesitation, she said, "We can talk here."

Gwendolyn didn’t want to be alone with Grayson, so she subtly shifted away, lowering her voice to a whisper.

Grayson didn’t protest.

Once he was certain they were out of earshot, his tone turned grave. "Gwendolyn, I’ve made my decision. You occupy a special place in my heart."

Gwendolyn blinked, stunned. "Excuse me?" No way. My delusional ex-boss is in love with me? That can’t be right. What does he even see in me? Didn’t he pick me because I look like Vivian? Is this some twisted consolation prize because he couldn’t win her back? Is he seriously trying to hire me as his rebound again? Absolutely not. That’s not a respectable arrangement, and I only agreed last time because I had no choice. I don’t need that kind of money now.

She cleared her throat. "Mr. Hart, if this is like before—"

"It’s nothing like before," Grayson cut in firmly. "This time, it’s real. Be mine."

Gwendolyn nearly choked. Oh, I see. Last time, he paid me. Now he wants my services for free? That’s even worse.

Nearby, Evelyn discreetly activated her system to eavesdrop. Holy hell, is this for real? Is he seriously falling for the replacement and aiming for a cliché happy ending with her?

Nathan, overhearing, was equally shocked. He had genuinely expected Grayson to choose Vivian.

Even Gwendolyn was baffled. Her lips twitched as she prepared to reject him outright—until Grayson dropped another bombshell.

"However, I will still reconcile with Vivian. I might even marry her. I hope you won’t obsess over formal titles."

Gwendolyn’s jaw dropped. "What? Run that by me again?"

Grayson frowned, as if pained by her reaction. "This is the best solution I could devise. But we must keep this from Vivian. She has a temper, and I doubt she’d accept our arrangement. For your sake, I’m sacrificing her happiness. As long as you behave, I’ll provide for you—financially and emotionally. If you want children someday, that’s possible too. You’ll lack a title, but I won’t let you feel neglected."

Gwendolyn’s expression went blank. She recalled Vivian’s kindness earlier and couldn’t help but ask, "So you’re saying you’ll marry Vivian while keeping me as your mistress—and hide it from her?"

"Don’t phrase it so crudely. There’s no alternative." Grayson truly believed this was the perfect compromise. If both women adore me, why should I choose? High society operates like this. My father has mistresses; my mother has her distractions. Yet our family remains harmonious. Gwendolyn’s an orphan—ideal for this role. She’s always known her place, aware a future with me is impossible. That’s why she’s so insecure, desperate to leave. Her behavior today is erratic—clearly panic over Vivian’s return. She fears losing my affection. Well, I’ll reassure her.

His gaze softened with rare tenderness as he reached for her face, concerned by her frozen shock—

Tears of pure joy streamed down Gwendolyn's face.

Just as Grayson reached out to wipe them away, a sharp smack shattered the lively atmosphere of the party.

The entire venue froze. Every head turned toward the source of the sound.

Evelyn was already sitting up, her fists clenched. Damn it, why didn’t she slap him harder? What kind of delusional nonsense is this man spouting?

Nathan’s expression darkened as he studied Grayson. After all that time to think, Grayson had somehow arrived at the worst possible conclusion.

Grayson glanced at his stinging hand, the back of it already flushed red.

But instead of anger, he merely shot a warning glare at the onlookers. The crowd immediately scattered, pretending they hadn’t been eavesdropping—though, in truth, they hadn’t caught a word.

Then, his gaze returned to Gwendolyn. "I know you don’t want to accept this, but it’s the best offer you’re going to get."

Gwendolyn’s eyes burned with fury, her fingers trembling at her sides.

Hit him again! I’ll back you up. A man like this won’t learn unless you knock some sense into him. Who does he think he is, making demands like that? Evelyn was practically vibrating with the urge to intervene. Even if she couldn’t speak, she at least wanted to pull Gwendolyn away before the poor woman burst a blood vessel. But Nathan held her back.

Evelyn shot him an irritated look, but he subtly gestured toward the entrance.

Vivian was striding toward them, clutching a thick stack of documents, her face alight with excitement.

The moment she spotted Gwendolyn—trembling, red-eyed, and clearly on the verge of exploding—her smile vanished. Instinctively, she rushed forward, yanking Gwendolyn behind her and squaring up to Grayson.

"Grayson," she snapped, her voice sharp as a blade. "What the hell are you doing?"

###Chapter 257 Suffering From Love Delusion

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting a golden glow over her coffee cup. She took a slow sip, savoring the rich aroma, when suddenly—

"Oh my god, did you hear about Nathan Blackwood and that actress?"

Evelyn nearly choked. The voice wasn’t from her phone or the TV—it was inside her head.

She froze.

Since when could she hear other people’s thoughts?

The mental chatter continued, sharp and vivid. "Rumor has it he spent the entire weekend at Seraphina Delacroix’s villa. His poor fiancée has no idea."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup. Nathan—her Nathan—cheating? Impossible.

But then another thought slithered in, this one dripping with venom. "Of course he’d stray. Men like him always do. Just ask his ex, Vanessa Sterling."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

She had to find out if this was real. If her mind had somehow become a receiver for the world’s juiciest gossip, she’d use it.

And if Nathan was guilty?

Well.

She’d make sure he regretted it.

Gwendolyn's sudden appearance sent a jolt of panic through Grayson's system. He cleared his throat hastily, forcing a casual tone. "Nothing important. Just catching up."

The guilt gnawed at him. The last thing he wanted was for Vivian to discover his secret conversation with Gwendolyn.

"Gwendolyn. I need your answer," Grayson pressed, his voice laced with unspoken meaning.

To the oblivious onlookers, his words were cryptic. No one else had any clue what they were discussing.

Grayson was certain Gwendolyn would keep their exchange private. After all, it wasn’t exactly something to brag about. She’ll take my offer seriously once she’s alone. She might be hurt now, but she’ll realize this is the best deal she’ll ever get—love, security, a family. The only thing missing is my public acknowledgment. That’s a small price to pay for everything else I’m offering.

Smug satisfaction settled over him. He’d solved his problem neatly. No more using Gwendolyn to make Vivian jealous. Now, he could focus entirely on winning Vivian back.

Confident, he turned to Vivian, his guard lowering as he prepared to speak.

But Vivian didn’t even glance at him. Instead, her brows furrowed as she locked eyes with Gwendolyn. "What’s going on? What was he saying to you?"

The crowd assumed Vivian was suspicious of Gwendolyn trying to steal Grayson away.

Only Evelyn and Nathan knew the truth—Vivian had already received the DNA results confirming Gwendolyn was her half-sister.

Wow. Protective already. She’s not angry—she’s thrilled she found her sister. Classic Vivian. Evelyn smirked.

Nathan chuckled under his breath. Her generosity never fails to impress.

Gwendolyn, however, missed the warmth in Vivian’s tone. Her chest burned with disgust.

It wasn’t just Grayson’s revolting proposal. It was the fact that he’d plotted to deceive a woman like Vivian—keeping Gwendolyn as his dirty little secret. The realization made her sick.

She’d once excused his behavior, thinking his obsession with Vivian drove him to extremes. But now? He was just another manipulative liar.

The gratitude she’d felt for his high-paying job? Gone.

Ignoring Vivian’s question, Gwendolyn fixed Grayson with a sharp glare. "I don’t need time to think. My answer is no."

Grayson blinked. "What?"

Just as Grayson was about to lose his patience, Gwendolyn spun around and pulled Vivian aside. "He claims he wants to reconcile with you, marry you someday, and then expects me to be his dirty little secret. The audacity of this man—wanting to have his cake and eat it too!"

Her voice rang out sharply, slicing through the hum of conversation. The entire venue fell into stunned silence.

Everyone froze. They couldn’t believe Grayson had actually said those words to Gwendolyn—let alone that she’d exposed him so boldly in front of everyone.

No one had expected Gwendolyn to air such scandalous laundry in public, but the fact that she did proved one thing: she wanted nothing to do with his twisted proposal.

Before this, the crowd had assumed Gwendolyn was hopelessly infatuated with Grayson. They’d thought her earlier outburst was just an act—a desperate ploy for attention.

But Grayson had spent so long carefully crafting his image, subtly manipulating perceptions, that when Gwendolyn dropped this bombshell, the cognitive dissonance hit like a freight train. The guests stood there, mortified, their toes curling in secondhand embarrassment.

Some considered leaving, but the allure of juicy drama was too strong.

They held their breaths, waiting for the fallout.

Evelyn instinctively clung to Nathan, her eyes wide with feigned shock. "What? Grayson would never do something like that!"

Nathan let her cling to him, but his grip tightened slightly, ensuring she didn’t topple off her chair in her exaggerated reaction.

The expressions on Grayson’s friends’ faces were priceless. They knew he had a wild streak, but this? This was beyond reckless.

Vivian was their friend too. If Grayson had genuinely fallen for Gwendolyn, fine. But to humiliate Vivian while chasing Gwendolyn? That was unforgivable.

Vivian stood frozen for a full thirty seconds, processing the words.

Then, mechanically, she turned to Grayson, who stood there like a deer in headlights.

This absolute moron actually thought he could play us both?

The realization hit her like a slap. She’d been an idiot for ever loving him. Not only had she tarnished her own reputation, but she’d dragged her little sister into this mess.

Her feelings toward Gwendolyn had always been complicated. Discovering they were sisters had been thrilling, but the circumstances—her mother’s affair—left a bitter taste. Still, nothing could outweigh the joy of finding family.

Now, guilt surged through her. Because of her past with Grayson, Gwendolyn had suffered.

How dare this spineless bastard scheme against us? How dare he hurt my sister?

Rage burned through her veins. Without giving Grayson a second to react, she lunged forward, her arm swinging—

The sharp sound of skin meeting skin echoed through the room as Evelyn delivered two swift slaps, sending Grayson stumbling backward until he collapsed onto the floor.

Done.

Grayson pressed a hand to his stinging cheek, his expression one of utter disbelief. He couldn’t comprehend how things had spiraled so completely out of his control. His gaze snapped toward Gwendolyn, his voice laced with accusation. "Have you lost your mind? Who told you to reveal everything? Do you even want to be with me anymore?"

Good grief. Evelyn shook her head in exasperation. Those slaps clearly weren’t enough to knock sense into him.

"What’s wrong? Suddenly too cowardly to own up to your actions?" Gwendolyn’s fury only intensified at his words. "Be with you? Why don’t you scrape the delusions out of your brain and take a good, hard look at yourself? What on earth makes you think I’d ever be interested in a self-absorbed fool like you? Stop living in your fantasy world. I’ve never had feelings for you. How many times do I have to say it before it sinks in? Are you just dense, or do you refuse to listen? If you keep harassing me, I will call the police!"

The tension in the room thickened as everyone absorbed her words.

In the past, no matter how harshly Gwendolyn had rejected him, Grayson had always dismissed it as sarcasm or anger. When questioned by others, he’d smugly claimed she was just throwing a tantrum—that deep down, she still cared.

But now? She had stripped him bare, leaving no shred of his pride intact.

"You’ll regret this," Grayson spat, his voice trembling with wounded pride.

"Gwendolyn couldn’t have been clearer, yet you still think this is some kind of lover’s quarrel?" Vivian scoffed, stepping forward. "I never realized just how deranged you were. Tell me—what does she have to do to prove she wants nothing to do with you? Or are you so narcissistic that no matter what she says, you’ll twist it into some twisted fantasy where she’s still pining for you? Get help, Grayson. You’re not in love—you’re obsessed."

###Chapter 258 Do You Like Her

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, her mind wandering to the events of last night's gala—where Nathan Blackwood had been unusually attentive.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant: "The Blackwood Group just finalized the merger. Also, Victoria Hayes was seen leaving Nathan's office in tears. Again."

Evelyn smirked. Victoria, Nathan's scheming secretary, had been trying—and failing—to claw her way into his life for years. But what truly piqued Evelyn's interest was the unspoken drama she could hear in people's minds—a gift (or curse) she'd had since childhood.

She closed her eyes, tuning into the mental chatter around the city.

"If Nathan finds out I leaked those documents—" Victoria's panicked thoughts sliced through the mental noise.

"Sophia Blackwood is hiding something about her husband’s affair. Should I tell Nathan?" That was Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s sharp-witted agent, always collecting secrets like rare gems.

Then, the most intriguing whisper of all—Nathan’s own voice, laced with frustration: "Why can’t I stop thinking about Evelyn?"

Her breath hitched.

A knock at the door interrupted her eavesdropping. Speak of the devil—Nathan stood there, his tailored suit hugging his broad shoulders, his storm-gray eyes dark with an emotion she couldn’t place.

"Evelyn," he said, voice rough. "We need to talk."

She arched a brow. "About Victoria’s latest meltdown? Or the fact that your sister’s husband is embezzling from your company?"

His jaw tightened. "How do you—"

She tapped her temple, smirking. "Trade secret."

Nathan stepped closer, his cologne—sandalwood and something dangerously addictive—wrapping around her. "Then you already know why I’m here."

Her pulse spiked. She did know. She’d heard it in his thoughts, felt it in the way his gaze lingered. But some games were more fun played out loud.

"Enlighten me," she challenged.

He cupped her face, his thumb brushing her lower lip. "You’re the only one who doesn’t need me to say it."

And just like that, Evelyn realized—she might’ve been reading minds her whole life, but Nathan Blackwood? He was the one mystery she couldn’t solve.

The crowd was stunned into silence as the two women spoke in perfect unison, their voices harmonizing in an unexpected alliance against Grayson.

It was uncanny. Not only did they share an almost identical appearance, but even their mannerisms when berating someone were eerily similar.

Fascinating didn’t even begin to cover it.

Grayson, however, was visibly rattled. He had always been unsure of his place in Vivian’s heart, but how could Gwendolyn—a young woman still in university—possibly not harbor feelings for him?

"How could you not like me?" His voice was laced with desperation as he grasped for any shred of proof. "You stayed by my side for so long. If you didn’t care, why would you agree to be someone else’s stand-in?"

The onlookers murmured in agreement. After all, no one would willingly endure such a role unless they had feelings—or ulterior motives. If she had wanted status, why refuse his offer now?

But if she had loved him, why was she treating him like this?

The crowd was thoroughly perplexed.

Gwendolyn scoffed, her tone dripping with disdain. "Since you brought it up, I might as well clarify. Our arrangement was strictly professional. You hired me—five hundred thousand a month to impersonate Vivian. It was a job, nothing more. If the orphanage hadn’t been struggling, I wouldn’t have taken it. So tell me, Grayson, where in that contract did it say I had to fall for you?"

She arched a brow. "Or are you upset because I was too convincing? Because I did my job too well?" A cold smile curved her lips. "Our contract ended. Yet here you are, still harassing me. Pathetic, don’t you think?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

They had assumed Gwendolyn had been clinging to Grayson for personal gain. But this? A paid arrangement?

"No way… Did Mr. Hart really forget he hired her?"

"That explains why she left so fast. She was just collecting a paycheck!"

"Honestly, the way she’s acting now makes perfect sense. It’s like running into an ex-boss you can’t stand."

"Mr. Hart actually thought they’d fight over him? I’m dying."

"I always knew he was arrogant, but this is next-level delusional."

A pause. Then someone whispered, "Wait… so out of the three, is Lila the only one who actually likes him?"

The room erupted into stifled laughter.

Grayson’s face darkened.

This wasn’t how this was supposed to go.

Not at all.

The entire scene had been nothing but a carefully orchestrated performance, hadn't it? The thought alone sent waves of amusement through me, and I couldn’t suppress a laugh.

The crowd around us was thoroughly entertained, their whispers and chuckles filling the air.

Grayson’s friends, however, looked as if they wanted to disappear. After all, he had boasted endlessly in front of them, painting himself as some untouchable heartthrob. Their previous pity for Gwendolyn—the poor, lovestruck assistant hopelessly devoted to a man who would never return her feelings—had now twisted into something far more humiliating.

None of them had known the truth. That Grayson had paid for every single one of those staged affections.

The realization left them torn between secondhand embarrassment and simmering anger. None of them could bear to look at Grayson now, yet the irony of his self-inflicted downfall was almost too delicious to ignore.

Evelyn was practically vibrating with glee.

Finally! The truth is out! Oh, this is too good!

Nathan quickly wrapped an arm around Evelyn, who was practically bouncing in her seat with unrestrained laughter. Her eyes sparkled with mischief, bright as stars against the dim lighting of the venue.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan found himself lost in them. A shame, really, that such brilliance wasn’t directed at him.

Meanwhile, Grayson stood frozen, his mind still reeling from Gwendolyn’s sudden confession.

In his mind, the money had been nothing more than a transaction—a way to keep her at arm’s length, to ensure she never developed real feelings for him. A paltry sum, really, barely worth a second thought.

But he hadn’t considered that for someone like her, desperation could make even the most degrading roles tolerable.

He had assumed the money was just a convenient excuse between them, a way to avoid messy emotions.

How wrong he had been.

Every assumption, every smug certainty—it had all been nothing but his own delusion.

And now, even a fool could see the raw disgust in Gwendolyn’s eyes as she looked at him.

Humiliation burned through him, quickly followed by a surge of fury. But what enraged him most was the realization that he had been the one to fall for her.

Grayson lunged forward, intent on confronting her, demanding answers. He needed to hear her say it—that she had never cared for him, not even a little. He couldn’t accept this.

But Vivian stepped smoothly into his path, blocking him.

“Why…?” Grayson’s voice cracked. “You were supposed to hate her. I made you hate her!”

Vivian’s expression didn’t waver. “You really are pathetic, aren’t you?”

Grayson flinched as if struck.

“Let me make this crystal clear,” Vivian continued, her voice sharp as a blade. “From the very beginning, you were the only one playing these disgusting games. And yet, you still expected us to fight over you? To worship the ground you walked on?” She scoffed. “You’re nothing but trash. Neither of us has ever wanted you. We loathe you. And if you take one more step toward either of us, I swear I’ll make sure you regret it.”

Grayson’s eyes burned red with fury.

But for the first time, no one was looking at him with admiration.

Only pity.

The moment Grayson's eyes landed on Vivian shielding Gwendolyn protectively, his blood ran cold. Vivian’s stance was unyielding, as if she were guarding a priceless treasure. A horrifying thought struck him like lightning, leaving him breathless with shock. "You—you can't possibly be in love with her, can you? That's why you're both ganging up on me!"

The more Grayson dwelled on it, the more furious he became. It felt like betrayal all over again—twice in one lifetime.

The murmurs around them ceased instantly.

Hah! Is he serious? His imagination knows no bounds.

Evelyn nearly choked on her laughter, burying her face in Nathan’s chest to muffle her giggles.

Nathan, however, tensed. The unresolved matter of their familial ties still hung between them. This wasn’t the time or place for such revelations, but now—

The stifled snickers around Grayson made it clear no one bought his theory. Enraged, he snapped, "You’ve always preferred women—you admitted it yourself! Since when do you cozy up to someone you just met? Back then, you couldn’t stand people copying you, let alone someone who looks like your mirror image. Defending her? That’s suspicious as hell. Do you like her? Is that it?"

His wild accusations planted seeds of doubt.

After all, Vivian’s fierce defense of Gwendolyn wasn’t just about goodwill or justice. It was… unusual.

Eyes darted between Vivian and Gwendolyn, speculation thickening the air.

Vivian had been accused of many things—infidelity, coldness—but never this. She wasn’t into women, and she certainly didn’t recall ever claiming otherwise. If she had, it must’ve been a throwaway comment.

"Seriously, Grayson," Vivian said dryly, "get your delusions checked."

"Then why are you so damn protective of her?" Grayson shot back, voice trembling with fury. "We’ve known each other for years. We were together. You—"

The unspoken accusation hung heavy: Vivian, who always stood by those she trusted, should’ve defended him. Not Gwendolyn. Even Evelyn hadn’t intervened.

There was only one explanation: Vivian and Gwendolyn shared something far deeper.

###Chapter 259 Your Mother Is My Biological Mother

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the grand ballroom, all eyes turned toward her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the room, illuminating the sea of elegantly dressed guests. But none shone as brightly as Evelyn in her midnight-blue gown, the delicate sequins catching the light with every graceful movement.

Nathan Blackwood stood near the balcony, his piercing gaze locked onto her. He had known she would come—had willed her to—but seeing her now, poised and radiant, sent an unexpected jolt through him. His fingers tightened around his glass of whiskey, the ice clinking softly.

"Mr. Blackwood," Victoria Hayes murmured beside him, her voice laced with thinly veiled irritation. "Shouldn’t you be mingling with the investors?"

Nathan barely spared her a glance. "Later."

Victoria’s lips thinned, but she said nothing more. She knew better than to push him when he was in this mood.

Across the room, Evelyn felt the weight of Nathan’s stare like a physical touch. She resisted the urge to look his way, focusing instead on the conversation with Serena Whitmore, her ever-loyal agent.

"You’re causing quite the stir," Serena whispered, nodding subtly toward the whispers trailing in Evelyn’s wake.

Evelyn smirked. "Good. Let them talk."

But her confidence wavered when she spotted her—Margaret Blackwood, Nathan’s mother, watching her with an unreadable expression. The matriarch of the Blackwood family was a formidable woman, and Evelyn had no illusions about where she stood in Margaret’s eyes.

Then, as if summoned by her thoughts, Nathan appeared before her.

"Evelyn." His voice was low, intimate, sending a shiver down her spine despite herself.

"Nathan," she replied coolly. "Enjoying the party?"

His lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. "More now that you’re here."

Serena discreetly excused herself, leaving them in a bubble of tension.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Flattery won’t work on me."

Nathan leaned in slightly, his breath warm against her ear. "Then what will?"

Before she could retort, the lights dimmed, and the orchestra began a slow, haunting melody. Guests paired off for the dance, and Nathan extended his hand.

"Dance with me."

It wasn’t a request.

Evelyn hesitated—just for a second—before placing her hand in his. The moment their fingers touched, electricity crackled between them.

As they moved across the floor, the world narrowed to just the two of them. Nathan’s grip was firm, his body a solid presence against hers.

"You’ve been avoiding me," he murmured.

"You noticed," she quipped.

His jaw tightened. "I always notice when it comes to you."

The raw honesty in his voice caught her off guard. She opened her mouth to respond, but the music swelled, and Nathan spun her in a graceful arc, silencing her.

When the song ended, he didn’t release her. Instead, his fingers tightened around hers.

"We need to talk," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn’s pulse raced. About what? The past? The future? The unspoken things between them that neither dared to voice?

Before she could ask, a sharp voice cut through the moment.

"Nathan." Margaret stood nearby, her expression icy. "A word."

Nathan’s grip on Evelyn loosened, but his gaze remained locked onto hers. "This isn’t over."

Evelyn watched him walk away, her heart pounding.

No. It wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

Vivian rolled her eyes, ready to fire back a sarcastic remark when she noticed the uncertain glances exchanged among the onlookers.

Gwendolyn, too, had gone rigid beside her.

For a moment, Vivian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Is my sister seriously worried I have feelings for her?

Gwendolyn was genuinely stunned. After all, she barely knew Vivian compared to Grayson. She had no way of telling whether his accusation held any truth.

It was strange how warmly Vivian had treated her from the moment they met.

Looking back now, though they’d felt an instant connection, Vivian’s overwhelming kindness had left her slightly bewildered.

Not to mention the guilt gnawing at her. She’d liked men before, but this? This was different. Never had she felt such an inexplicable pull toward another woman—especially one she’d just met.

So yes, she was flustered.

Evelyn and Nathan knew the truth, of course. They just weren’t sure if Vivian would reveal it now.

They say blood recognizes blood—that even strangers bound by family feel an instinctive pull. But if misunderstood, that bond could spiral into something messy.

Evelyn’s thoughts drifted before snapping back to the scene unfolding before her.

Vivian, meanwhile, had made up her mind—though it wasn’t how she’d planned to do this.

In one swift motion, she flung the documents in her hand straight at Grayson’s face.

"Open your damn eyes and read this, you idiot! What kind of delusional nonsense have you cooked up in that head of yours? Of course I care about her more than you!"

Without waiting for his reaction, she turned to Gwendolyn, her expression softening.

"Gwen, I’m sorry. I wanted to tell you privately, but thanks to this moron"—she jerked a thumb at Grayson—"we’re doing it here. If we don’t clear this up now, people might actually believe his ridiculous accusations. I don’t care what they think of me, but I won’t let him tarnish your reputation."

She took a deep breath.

"You’re my half-sister. Same mother, different fathers."

Silence.

Then chaos.

The revelation hit like a thunderclap.

Murmurs erupted, disbelief thick in the air.

"Wait—the girl Grayson hired as Vivian’s stand-in is actually her sister?"

"Same mother, different fathers? So they share a mom? Hold on—my brain’s short-circuiting. This is insane."

The whispers grew louder, the shock rippling through the crowd.

Grayson, still clutching the papers Vivian had thrown at him, paled.

And Gwendolyn?

She stood frozen, her world tilting on its axis.

The conversation was abruptly cut short by Grayson's shocked exclamation. "This can't be!"

Eyes turned toward him as someone quickly deciphered the document in his hands.

"It's a DNA report. They're biologically related."

"I always thought they looked eerily similar."

"Damn, this is... explosive."

While Evelyn and Nathan remained composed, the rest of the group surged forward, crowding around Grayson.

"It's true!" Marcus gasped, eyes wide.

"Today just keeps getting crazier." Vivian and Lucas exchanged stunned glances. Could fate really be this twisted?

Lucas's lips twitched in disbelief. Just weeks ago, Grayson had been scheming against the two women. Now this?

Beatrice gasped, "Vivian, did your family lose a child?"

Gwendolyn recoiled, shaking her head. "No—that's impossible. I had parents. I—"

The revelation hit her like a tidal wave, leaving her breathless.

Vivian grasped Gwendolyn's trembling hands, voice thick with emotion. "Your mother was my birth mother. The woman I call Mom now is my stepmother. Few know this back home. The moment I saw you, I knew. Blood recognizes blood. I had my doubts, so I took a strand of your hair for testing. There's no mistake. We are sisters."

Her grip tightened, desperation creeping into her tone. "Don't you want me as family? Your parents are gone—I'm all you have left. God, if only I'd found you sooner. All those years in that orphanage..." A tear slipped free. "But I swear, no one will hurt you again."

Her investigation into Gwendolyn's past had revealed chilling parallels.

At five, Vivian's mother vanished. At four, Gwendolyn's died. Neither truly knew a mother's love. Sisters in sorrow.

Yet Vivian had a doting father and stepmother, raised in luxury. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn grew up in a cold orphanage, fighting for every scrap of kindness.

The thought of her sister reduced to being a paid stand-in shattered Vivian's heart.

The usually flamboyant socialite now gazed at Gwendolyn with raw tenderness.

Gwendolyn's resistance crumbled. That inexplicable pull toward Vivian? Blood calling to blood.

Maybe... maybe this wasn't so hard to accept after all.

It felt like the heavens had dropped an unexpected gift into her lap.

Gwendolyn Brooks was overwhelmed by a storm of emotions, leaving her momentarily speechless.

"Don't you want me as your sister?" Vivian Moore's voice softened, playing the wounded card perfectly.

Gwendolyn shook her head quickly. "No, that's not—"

Then she froze, cheeks heating with embarrassment.

Oh no.

"Call me Viv," Vivian murmured, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, lips trembling ever so slightly—as if she were holding back a flood of joy.

Gwendolyn hesitated. Under Vivian's hopeful gaze, she finally whispered, "Viv."

Instantly, tears welled in Vivian's eyes.

None of their friends had ever seen Vivian like this—vulnerable, emotional, raw.

They were stunned into silence.

As Vivian's tears spilled over, Gwendolyn's own eyes burned. It was as if she could physically feel her sister's emotions, and her throat tightened.

"Gwen!" Vivian's voice was thick with emotion before she pulled Gwendolyn into a crushing embrace.

It was a picture-perfect moment of sisterly love.

Yet, aside from shock and confusion, most of the onlookers didn’t fully grasp Vivian’s reaction.

After all, an ordinary person wouldn’t easily accept that their mother had another child.

But Vivian was anything but ordinary.

She had long accepted that she would never marry or have children of her own. To suddenly discover a sister—one as sweet and kindred as Gwendolyn—was nothing short of a miracle.

Look at her! Vivian thought, heart swelling. She’s perfect. So gentle, so accepting. Like she was meant to be mine all along.

Evelyn Sinclair watched, genuinely moved. She began clapping, celebrating their reunion.

The crowd’s attention shifted to her. Seeing Evelyn and Nathan Blackwood applauding, others gradually joined in, their applause filling the room.

"Congratulations on finding each other!" Evelyn beamed.

Vivian immediately thanked everyone on Gwendolyn’s behalf. "This is my little sister," she declared proudly, ruffling Gwendolyn’s hair affectionately. "Remember her face!"

Gwendolyn still felt dazed, as if everything had happened in the blink of an eye.

The moment Evelyn turned to face the disoriented Grayson, her heart pounded violently in her chest. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension, thick enough to slice with a knife.

Grayson blinked, his usually sharp gaze clouded with confusion. "What did you just say?" His voice was rough, barely above a whisper, as if he couldn't believe his own ears.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. She had rehearsed this moment a thousand times in her head, yet now that it was here, the words lodged in her throat like shards of glass.

"Your mother," she repeated, forcing each syllable out with deliberate precision, "is my biological mother."

A deafening silence followed. Grayson's face drained of color, his lips parting slightly as if to protest, but no sound came out. The revelation hung between them like a guillotine, poised to sever whatever fragile connection they had left.

Evelyn exhaled shakily. She had expected anger, denial—anything but this stunned silence. But then, she had never imagined this truth would come to light under such circumstances.

Grayson staggered back a step, his hand flying to his temple as if struck by a sudden migraine. "That's impossible," he muttered, though the doubt in his voice was unmistakable.

"Is it?" Evelyn countered, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her. "Then explain why Margaret kept this from you. From both of us."

His jaw clenched, a muscle ticking in his cheek. For a man who always had a quick retort, Grayson was uncharacteristically speechless.

Evelyn pressed on, her tone softening just a fraction. "I didn’t want to believe it either. But the evidence is undeniable."

Grayson's eyes darkened, his fingers raking through his hair in frustration. "If you're lying—"

"I'm not," she cut in sharply. "And if you dare spread rumors about my sister again, I swear, Grayson, I'll break every bone in your body before you can blink."

The threat hung in the air, raw and unyielding. For the first time, Grayson seemed to truly see her—not as the woman he'd once dismissed, but as someone who had been fighting battles he knew nothing about.

His shoulders sagged, the fight draining out of him. "Damn it, Evelyn," he rasped. "What the hell are we supposed to do now?"

She didn’t have an answer.

And that terrified her more than anything.

###Chapter 260: Mind Games and Whispered Secrets

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's luxurious penthouse as she lounged on her velvet chaise, sipping her jasmine tea. Her phone buzzed incessantly—another tabloid article about Nathan Blackwood’s latest scandal. She smirked, scrolling through the salacious details.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Club with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen. The grainy photo showed Nathan, his dark hair tousled, his usual composed demeanor replaced by something wilder. Beside him, a woman in a sleek red dress clung to his arm, her face obscured by shadows.

Interesting.

She tapped the screen, zooming in. The woman’s posture was familiar—too familiar.

Victoria Hayes.

Nathan’s secretary. His supposed loyal assistant.

Evelyn’s lips curled. Oh, this was delicious.

She set her tea aside and reached for her laptop, pulling up her private files. If Victoria thought she could slink into Nathan’s life unnoticed, she was sorely mistaken. Evelyn had eyes everywhere.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not bothering to look up.

Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped inside, holding a sleek black folder. "You asked for the Blackwood Industries report, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn waved a hand. "Leave it. And Lillian?"

"Yes?"

"Tell Preston Whitmore I need to see him. Immediately."

Lillian hesitated. "He’s in a meeting with Donovan Sharpe—"

"Now, Lillian."

The assistant nodded and hurried out.

Evelyn leaned back, tapping her nails against the armrest. Nathan thought he could play games? Fine. She’d play better.

Her phone buzzed again—a message from an unknown number.

"You should see what else she’s hiding."

Attached was another photo. Victoria, but not with Nathan this time.

With Daniel Prescott.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Oh, this was so much better than she’d imagined.

Nathan Blackwood’s Office – 11:47 AM

Nathan massaged his temples, the headache from last night’s indiscretion pounding behind his eyes. He shouldn’t have let Victoria drag him out. Shouldn’t have let her get so close.

But damn if she wasn’t persuasive.

His phone rang—Julian, his ever-dramatic brother.

"What?" Nathan snapped.

"Someone leaked photos of you and Victoria," Julian said, voice tight. "Evelyn’s already seen them."

Nathan’s stomach dropped.

Of course she had.

He exhaled sharply. "Damage control. Now."

Julian scoffed. "Too late for that. She’s already called a meeting with Preston."

Nathan’s jaw clenched. Preston Whitmore—Evelyn’s favorite director. The man who could spin any scandal into a blockbuster.

This wasn’t just about humiliation.

This was war.

Seraphina Delacroix’s Dressing Room – 2:15 PM

Seraphina Delacroix scrolled through the gossip blogs, her manicured nails clicking against her phone screen.

"Nathan Blackwood’s Secret Affair? Insider Claims He’s Two-Timing Evelyn Sinclair!"

She smirked.

Sebastian Hart, her insufferable ex, had been whining about losing a role to Nathan for weeks. Now? Now he’d eat his words.

She dialed Adrian Cross, her current distraction.

"Did you see the news?" she purred.

Adrian’s chuckle was dark. "Oh, darling. I made the news."

Seraphina stilled. "What?"

"Let’s just say… Victoria Hayes isn’t the only one with secrets."

The line went dead.

Seraphina’s blood ran cold.

What the hell had Adrian done?

Even now, Grayson seemed unable to process the situation. His wild gaze darted between Nathan and Evelyn, his lips trembling with unspoken protests.

Just as he opened his mouth, a booming voice cut through the tension.

"Grayson Hart! You here?"

All heads turned toward the pool entrance, where four hulking figures stood. Their faces were vaguely recognizable—Lila’s brothers.

Grayson’s mind was still reeling. He squinted at them, irritation flashing across his face. "Not now! Whatever it is, deal with it later!"

"Oh, we’ll deal with it alright," the tallest brother snarled, cracking his knuckles. "You think you can mess with our sister and walk away?"

Lila’s brothers.

Oh, this was bad.

Lila, Grayson’s recent fling, came from a family with… questionable connections. Four overprotective brothers who didn’t care about high-society politics. When they’d heard how Grayson had strung Lila along, then discarded her like yesterday’s gossip, they’d stormed in for revenge.

And revenge, they intended to deliver.

Nathan’s instincts flared. He recognized the dangerous glint in their eyes. Without drawing attention, he nudged Evelyn behind him and signaled a staff member. Better to have security on standby.

But before help could arrive—

CRACK.

The first punch sent Grayson crashing into a champagne tower. Glass shattered. Women screamed. Chaos erupted.

Daniel, Lucas, Marcus, and Nathan exchanged glances. Sure, Grayson had it coming—but they couldn’t just watch him get pummeled. They lunged into the fray, pulling the brothers off, but not before Grayson’s face turned into a swollen, purple mess.

Humiliation burned hotter than the pain. Tears pricked his eyes.

This night would haunt him forever.

Security finally swarmed in, dragging the brothers back as they hurled curses. "You think your money makes you untouchable? You’re dead, Hart!"

Police were called. The Harts and the Carters arrived, turning the scene into a spectacle. The pool party? Over. The gossip? Just beginning.

By dawn, high society would have a new scandal to feast on.

And Grayson?

He’d just dug his own grave.

Final Reckoning

The crisp night air carried the scent of expensive perfumes as the group stood outside the pulsating nightclub, freshly changed and waiting for their rides.

Vivian Moore's grip on Gwendolyn Brooks' wrist was surprisingly gentle as she led her away, leaving the others exchanging bewildered glances.

"They really do look like sisters," Lucas Thornton murmured, watching their retreating figures.

"Vivian seems... oddly pleased," Beatrice Holloway observed, adjusting her emerald earrings. "She even mentioned bringing Gwendolyn to my engagement party next week."

Vivian Grant's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Do you think... Grayson would dare show his face there after tonight?"

Marcus Prescott snorted. "I'd pay good money to see that train wreck."

Daniel Wright shook his head, the neon lights casting shadows across his sharp features. "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Grayson just signed his own downfall."

Their conversation was drowned out by a sudden eruption of excited chatter nearby.

"It's her! The Truth Seeker! The Gossip Empress of high society!"

"Unbelievable. Last time she appeared at the Reed wedding, the whole thing got canceled. Now this? A simple party turns into a scandal worthy of prime-time drama."

"No wonder she's got a cult following. The woman knows everything!"

"I'm officially obsessed. Tonight's twists were better than any thriller novel. This'll be my dinner party story for months."

"Someone find out which event she's hitting next. I need front-row seats to the chaos."

"Rumor has it she never misses a wedding... especially not the upcoming Blackwood-Holloway one..."

Nathan Blackwood's inner circle exchanged loaded glances as Evelyn Sinclair descended the steps beside him, their gazes flickering toward Beatrice.

The silence stretched just a beat too long.

"What?" Evelyn finally asked, noticing their peculiar expressions.

Vivian Grant—never one for subtlety—blurted out, "Evelyn, darling, was this your handiwork tonight?"

Evelyn blinked in genuine surprise.

Marcus chuckled darkly. "Better watch your back. If Grayson ever sobers up enough to connect the dots..."

The realization dawned on Evelyn, and she rolled her eyes at their teasing. The streetlights caught the amusement dancing in her hazel eyes as the group dissolved into laughter, the night's drama already weaving itself into legend.

Yet, she truly hadn’t orchestrated any chaos in this matter. She’d merely stumbled upon the information ahead of time and was now content to sit back and watch the drama unfold.

Evelyn looked genuinely wronged. "This really has nothing to do with me."

.

Vivian and Marcus exchanged amused glances, their skepticism evident. They reiterated their hope that she would attend Marcus’s father’s nth wedding in the future.

Daniel cleared his throat, signaling them to dial back the chatter. They were oblivious to the fact that Beatrice might take offense to these metaphysical insinuations.

Still, if it was a matter of fate, then Daniel was genuinely grateful to Evelyn.

Of course, he dismissed it as mere coincidence. Evelyn had always thrived on gossip, drawn to the spectacle of scandal.

Nathan, too, reacted. His gaze flickered toward Beatrice.

Beatrice, ever blunt, remarked, "If this does have something to do with you, Vivian ought to reward you handsomely. But my engagement party is about to start. I should probably stay on guard."

A brief, awkward silence settled over them. They’d assumed Beatrice was truly bothered.

"My fiancé has a rather... colorful past. I don’t particularly care, so long as it doesn’t erupt into a scandal that jeopardizes our families’ business dealings. So, our little Angel of Justice, let’s keep things discreet, shall we?"

Her tone rose playfully as she spoke, making it clear she was joking.

There had been a sense of righteous vindication in all the previous gossip. But between her and her fiancé, Caleb, no such justice existed. Even if Evelyn uncovered something scandalous, Beatrice had no need for her to intervene.

She simply didn’t care. She’d agreed to this marriage alliance because her family had promised her the freedom to pursue her passions. Having reaped the benefits of her family’s wealth without contributing to the business, she saw this as a fair trade—a marriage in exchange for an unhindered pursuit of her dreams.

Romance had never interested her anyway.

At Beatrice’s rare attempt at humor, the group laughed.

Only Lucas’s expression grew increasingly unreadable.

The cars arrived one by one to collect them.

Soon, only Lucas, Evelyn, and Nathan remained.

Lucas watched as their car pulled up. On impulse, he took a step forward, his eyes locking onto Evelyn’s. He seemed on the verge of speaking, hesitation flickering across his face.

"Is there something you need?" Nathan asked.

When Evelyn turned to look at him, Lucas snapped back to reality, panic flashing in his eyes.

A dangerous glint flashed in his eyes as his jaw tightened, yet he remained silent.

Evelyn arched a delicate brow, her expression unreadable. "Don’t tell me you’re actually concerned about the engagement party too?" Her voice dripped with mockery. "Afraid I’ll ruin Caleb and Beatrice’s picture-perfect future?"

Lucas’s face twisted with self-deprecation, the irony of the situation not lost on him. He felt like a drowning man clutching at straws—desperate enough to start believing in miracles.

Just as he opened his mouth to deny it, Evelyn cut him off with a sharp laugh. "Or maybe you’re counting on me to show up and play my part perfectly—to turn that engagement party into a glorious disaster?"

The air between them crackled with tension, unspoken words hanging heavy. Lucas exhaled sharply, his fingers twitching at his sides.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying him with cold amusement. "Well?" she challenged. "Which is it?"

Lucas met her gaze, his own dark with conflict. He had no answer—only the sinking realization that he was standing at the edge of a cliff, and Grayson had already started digging the grave beneath them both.

###Chapter 261 Sleep Together Tonight

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her velvet chaise, sipping her matcha latte with deliberate calm, though her mind was anything but quiet.

Ever since she'd discovered her uncanny ability to hear others' thoughts—specifically, the juiciest, most scandalous ones—life had become infinitely more entertaining. And today, the mental chatter around her was particularly delicious.

Across the room, her assistant Lillian Graves fidgeted with a stack of contracts, her mind screaming: Oh my god, did Preston Whitmore really just fire Seraphina Delacroix mid-shoot? And after she showed up three hours late smelling like tequila?

Evelyn's lips curled. Now that's a headline waiting to happen.

Her phone buzzed—a text from Nathan Blackwood, her ridiculously handsome, infuriatingly enigmatic business rival (and, if she were honest with herself, the man who haunted her dreams).

Nathan: Meeting at 3. Don’t be late.

She rolled her eyes. His thoughts, unfortunately, were the one thing her ability couldn’t penetrate—a fact that drove her mad with curiosity. What was he hiding behind that perfectly sculpted jawline and those piercing gray eyes?

Then, like a gift from the gossip gods, her agent Serena Whitmore burst in, her mind a whirlwind of chaos: I can’t believe Vanessa Sterling had the nerve to show up at Harrison Montgomery’s premiere with his WIFE in the front row. The audacity!

Evelyn nearly choked on her latte. This, she thought gleefully, is going to be a spectacular day.

Nathan's expression shifted abruptly. "What nonsense are you talking about? I was merely looking for Lucas to discuss business matters. You're letting your imagination run wild. Do you seriously believe you possess some kind of supernatural ability? Hahaha."

"Hahaha." Evelyn forced an awkward laugh, making the moment unbearably comical.

A muscle twitched at the corner of Lucas's mouth. He suddenly recalled that Nathan was also entangled in a scandal of his own.

No one would have guessed that Nathan had been secretly pining for Beatrice for years, yet she was about to marry Caleb.

Nathan wasn’t the type to lack courage, which made Lucas wonder why he had never pursued the woman he’d loved for so long.

Lucas supposed it wasn’t surprising that Evelyn teased Nathan like this. Even he had questioned whether Nathan, too afraid to confess his feelings, was grasping at straws—hoping that some mystical force might intervene.

But judging by how Nathan swiftly deflected the conversation, it was clear his moment of desperation had passed.

Evelyn thought the same, so she didn’t press further. There was no real conflict—just a little playful mockery at Nathan’s expense.

The incident was quickly forgotten. Soon after, Evelyn and Lucas got into the car and drove off.

The entire ride, Evelyn chattered excitedly. The situation had been too bizarre to ignore. Lucas, ever the patient listener, let her ramble to her heart’s content.

"You know what? I should share this with the group," Evelyn said, pulling out her phone to send a message to The Quirks Chat.

The group was always hungry for scandalous updates.

In fact, a few days prior, two members of the Blackwood family had already left town.

Julian and Marcus had finally wrapped up their business in the entertainment industry and flown overseas.

Genevieve had also departed, heading abroad for her arts academy.

Still, the Blackwood family gossip group remained lively. The only downside was that they couldn’t enjoy the drama in person, leaving everyone feeling a little lonely.

This time, even Julian—who was thousands of miles away—couldn’t resist teasing, texting:
Evelyn, you really do have a knack for stumbling into these situations. There must be some cosmic force at play here.

Sophia replied: Absolutely. Who knows where you’d be without it?

Julian: Touche.

Boohoo. Ho

I wish I could be home right now, witnessing the drama unfold firsthand.



Margaret: Ah, we stay-at-home folks never get to enjoy the juicy gossip. The younger generation is leaving us behind in their exciting lives.

Richard: I feel the same way.

Evelyn could only respond with a comforting hug emoji.

When she returned home, the rest of the family was still gathered in the living room, deep in discussion.

Clearly, the news had already spread like wildfire—everyone knew except Evelyn.

Seated on the plush carpet, Theodore glanced up from his tablet. "Evelyn, you're trending online. Everyone's talking about you."

Evelyn blinked in amusement, shaking her head. Human nature never changes—gossip is irresistible, even to kids.

Before she could check her phone, her screen lit up with an incoming call from Isabelle.

Of course, Isabelle always had a sixth sense for breaking news.

Evelyn sighed dramatically. Why am I always the one blamed when we're all gossiping together?

Isabelle teased her mercilessly, saying that even though Evelyn had stepped away from the spotlight, her legend lived on. Her fanbase was growing, and every single one of them was fiercely loyal.

Some might say Evelyn was the first celebrity in the industry who constantly courted controversy yet always emerged unscathed—earning her the unofficial title of Gossip Queen.

Naturally, not everyone was pleased. Some accused her of manipulating the media, using insider knowledge from her investigations into high-society scandals to craft her own narrative.

But Evelyn couldn’t care less. She was too busy scrolling through her feed, thoroughly entertained.

After a warm shower, she slipped into her silk pajamas and sprawled across her bed, still engrossed in the online chatter.

Then—knock, knock.

Evelyn knew it was Nathan, coming to say goodnight.

Instantly, she set her phone aside and scrambled off the bed, rushing to the door.

When she opened it, there he stood—dressed in matching sleepwear, his dark eyes soft with affection.

The moment their gazes met, Evelyn’s pulse stuttered, her heartbeat betraying her calm facade.

But Nathan’s was worse. His breath hitched as he opened his mouth to speak—

Nathan didn't bid her goodnight as he usually did.

In the span of a few eerily silent seconds, a flush crept from his neck to his cheeks, staining them a deep pink.

Then, abruptly, he spoke.

"You wanted a hug, didn’t you?"

To Evelyn’s astonishment, he spread his arms wide, his robe parting slightly to reveal the sculpted planes of his chest.

She froze, momentarily speechless.

Nathan’s breath hitched. A thread of vulnerability laced his voice as he murmured, "You don’t want to hold me anymore?"

Only then did Evelyn remember—back at the pool, he had promised she could embrace him once they returned home.

Her pulse spiked as her gaze flickered over him. The way the robe draped over his frame was just as alluring as when he had been shirtless in the water, or when he’d slipped into that fitted short-sleeved shirt afterward.

Under her lingering scrutiny, Nathan found it impossible to relax.

At that very moment, the Blackwoods, who had been on the verge of sleep, perked up. Oh? Something interesting is happening.

Desire curled low in Evelyn’s stomach. Boldness begets reward. If he’s offering himself up so willingly, why shouldn’t I take advantage?

A wicked thought struck her. Maybe I can push it further.

Outwardly, Nathan remained composed.

Internally, his mind raced. Bolder? Does she mean… a kiss?

Evelyn tilted her chin up. "Actually, I want to sleep while holding you."

Nathan’s pupils dilated, his body temperature spiking. His voice roughened instantly. "What?"

Realizing the implication, Evelyn hastily clarified, "Just holding. Nothing more."

She recalled the pool—how safe and warm she had felt in his arms, how effortlessly she had relaxed. I’ve never shared a bed with anyone before. Wouldn’t it be nice to try?

It’s not like I’m lusting after him. Or that I want to wake up to his unfairly handsome face. Or that I’m seizing this chance for some shameless skinship.

We’re testing the waters of a relationship, after all. Sharing a bed is part of that, isn’t it?

Besides, I won’t do anything to him. His precious innocence will remain intact.

Evelyn mentally justified her craving, oblivious to Nathan’s internal struggle.

He watched her, torn between amusement and desperation.

He would give her anything—everything—if she asked. Yet here she was, bold enough to demand his embrace but skittish at the thought of crossing an invisible line.

It was as if she could act recklessly when emotions weren’t involved, but the moment feelings entered the equation, she hesitated.

And Nathan?

He was utterly, helplessly hers.

The tension between them was palpable, thick enough to slice through.

Nathan's lips pressed into a firm line as he took the initiative, stepping forward without hesitation. Evelyn, lost in her swirling thoughts, instinctively retreated into the room. Step by deliberate step, he advanced until the door clicked shut behind him, sealing them inside together.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood family members, who had strategically parked their cars right outside the bedroom doors, were practically vibrating with excitement.

They weren’t just eavesdropping—they were invested.

In the family group chat, Richard, Margaret, and Sophia were already in a frenzy:

Sophia: They’re going to share a bed tonight!

Margaret: Finally! I was starting to think they’d never take the next step.

Richard: Should we send champagne?

Julian and Genevieve, on the other hand, were stunned into silence.

This was not how they expected the night to unfold.

###Chapter 262 Her Cuddle Pillow

Reading Juicy Gossip in Her Mind

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the bustling café, she felt the weight of curious gazes upon her. The air was thick with whispers, the kind that slithered between tables like serpents, carrying secrets she wasn’t meant to hear—yet.

Her fingers tightened around her phone, the screen still lit with the scandalous article she’d just devoured. Nathan Blackwood spotted with Victoria Hayes at midnight? The headline burned behind her eyelids.

A barista slid her usual caramel macchiato across the counter, but Evelyn barely registered it. Her mind raced, replaying every interaction she’d ever had with Nathan. Had there been signs? Had she missed the way his gaze lingered a second too long on his secretary?

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” Lillian Graves murmured, sliding into the seat opposite her. Evelyn’s assistant had a knack for appearing at the worst possible moments.

“Just reading the news,” Evelyn replied, forcing a smile. She tapped her phone screen off, but not before Lillian’s sharp eyes caught the headline.

“Ah.” Lillian sipped her tea, feigning nonchalance. “That explains the murderous aura.”

Evelyn scoffed. “I’m not murderous.”

“Could’ve fooled me.” Lillian leaned in, lowering her voice. “For what it’s worth, the tabloids exaggerate. You know how they twist things.”

Do I? Evelyn’s nails dug into her palm. The article had included photos—grainy, but unmistakable. Nathan and Victoria, standing too close outside a dimly lit restaurant, his hand brushing her elbow.

A notification buzzed on her phone. A message from Serena Whitmore, her agent: Call me. Now.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Serena only used that tone when damage control was needed.

Lillian arched a brow. “Trouble?”

“Always.” Evelyn stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. She needed air. Space. A moment to think without the weight of the world watching.

But as she pushed through the café doors, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Nathan.

We need to talk.

Three words. That was all it took to send her carefully constructed composure crumbling.

The gossip columns had gotten one thing right: this wasn’t just a scandal.

It was a war.

Nathan stretched out on the plush king-sized bed in Evelyn’s bedroom, his muscles gradually unwinding. The soft mattress cradled him as he settled against the pillows, pulling Evelyn close.

She nestled against his sculpted abdomen, one arm draped possessively around his waist while the other scrolled lazily through her phone. The familiar, intoxicating scent of him—warm cedar and something uniquely Nathan—wrapped around her like a security blanket, soothing the restless edges of her heart.

Strangely, there was no awkwardness between them. Instead, an effortless harmony settled in, as if their bodies had always been meant to fit together this way. Just being near him was enough to mend the frayed pieces of their souls.

For Nathan, this quiet intimacy was pure bliss.

The past year had stretched like an eternity, yet in moments like this, time seemed to stand still. Evelyn—once distant, now vibrant and irreplaceable—had carved a permanent place in his heart.

"Hey, Nathan..." Evelyn suddenly tilted her head up.

His gaze had been fixed on her the entire time, so when their eyes met, a fleeting memory flashed through his mind—a younger, cherubic version of Evelyn grinning up at him from the same angle, her voice sweet as honey.

"You’re my cuddle pillow now, Nate. No moving until I fall asleep."

Meanwhile, in their own bedroom, Richard and Margaret lay side by side in peaceful silence.

Then, out of nowhere, Margaret burst into laughter.

Richard arched a brow. "That amused, are we? Just because they’re sharing a bed doesn’t mean it’s that kind of situation. Our son’s still figuring things out. I wouldn’t hold my breath."

It wasn’t that Richard doubted Nathan’s capabilities. But given his son’s history—especially that incident where even drugs couldn’t rouse certain... reactions—he wasn’t exactly optimistic.

If anything, they’d have to rely on Evelyn’s boldness to move things along.

Margaret chuckled. "No, no. I was just remembering that time at the estate. Remember? Evelyn couldn’t sleep without her stuffed pillow, but she accidentally spilled juice all over it. Her mother took it to wash, and even though it was just a nap, she refused to close her eyes. So what did she do? She commandeered Nathan as her replacement."

Richard snorted, the memory flooding back. "Oh, right! Poor kid turned into a human pillow. He stayed so still that by the time she woke up, his arm was completely numb!"

Margaret grinned. "And yet, he never complained. Not once."

Richard shook his head, amused. "Some things never change."

Margaret wiped tears of laughter from her eyes as she recounted the story. "Poor Evelyn was crying so hard she nearly hyperventilated. She thought she'd accidentally suffocated Nathan with her weight!"

Richard chuckled, adding, "She kept begging him not to die and swore she'd never use him as a pillow again. Back then, Nathan didn't say a word—just stood there frozen while Evelyn sobbed. He probably panicked internally, but you know how he is. Emotions? Locked away."

Margaret nodded, still grinning. "The funniest part? After that, Evelyn refused to cuddle him at all, no matter how much we coaxed her. Poor Nathan would just hover near her bed every night, like some kind of silent, brooding bodyguard waiting for permission to be her pillow again."

The two burst into laughter, reminiscing. "Who would've thought, after all these years, they'd end up right back where they started?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn studied Nathan's expression with mild concern. He was staring at her with that intense, unreadable gaze again. She waved a hand in front of his face. "Earth to Nathan? You okay?"

He blinked, snapping out of his daze. His mouth opened, then closed, as if struggling to form words.

"Are you tired?" she asked, shifting slightly. "Or is this uncomfortable? You don’t have to keep holding me if—"

"No," he cut in, voice rough. "It's perfect. You can stay like this forever."

Evelyn blinked. Forever? Wasn’t his arm going numb? Did this man even have muscle fatigue?

Before she could question him further, Nathan tightened his grip, pulling her closer against his chest. If this was happening, he wasn’t letting go.

"So," he murmured, changing the subject. "What did you want to show me?"

Evelyn grinned, grabbing her phone. "Oh, you’re going to love this. The internet’s exploding over the Decker scandal—way bigger than the last one."

Nathan glanced at the screen. Chaos indeed.

"Decker Heir’s Epic Fail: Paid for a Rebound, Got Two Sisters Instead."

The details were brutal. The Decker son had been so delusional, he’d assumed both women were head over heels for him—only to find out they were sisters plotting against him. Every new leak was more explosive than the last, and netizens were eating it up.

Evelyn had expected the trending topics to vanish within hours, courtesy of the Decker family’s PR team. But strangely, the posts remained.

Which made her very curious.

Who, exactly, was making sure this story stayed alive?

"It's a three-way power struggle, each with their own agenda. Getting those topics taken down won't be easy," Nathan remarked, his voice low and measured.

"A three-way power struggle?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"The Moore family, the Hayes family, and the Hart family."

"The Moores wouldn't want to suffer public humiliation, but do the other two families really want to escalate this?" Evelyn asked, surprise coloring her tone.

"Everyone has their own priorities. Once pride gets tangled up in the fight, no one can back down. I suspect they'll need some private negotiations before the topics disappear," Nathan explained, his fingers absently tracing circles on Evelyn's wrist.

Evelyn considered this for a moment. "Honestly, I'm more curious about how Vivian's parents reacted when she exposed Gwendolyn."

Since she didn't know the couple personally, she couldn't indulge in distant speculation about their private affairs.

So instead, she focused on the juicier gossip—Vivian and Gwendolyn's very public feud.

Nathan smirked. "They adore Vivian. Besides, the truth was bound to come out eventually. They've always preferred to keep things quiet, but it's not like they could hide this forever. Mrs. Hart took it in stride, but Mr. Hart..."

Evelyn nodded in understanding. After all, it was a child born from his ex-wife's betrayal—a living reminder of the man who had cuckolded him. No man could easily swallow that. Vivian had really put her father in an impossible position. The fact that she had publicly acknowledged Gwendolyn's identity must have taken immense courage. I wonder how they're handling it now? I should check in on them later.

Lost in thought, Evelyn's fingers unconsciously traced the defined ridges of Nathan's abs.

Suddenly, his muscles tensed beneath her touch. Evelyn blinked, snapping back to reality—but she didn't pull her hand away. Instead, she pretended to still be deep in contemplation, though her racing pulse betrayed her.

Oh no. My hand has a mind of its own. When did I even move it from his collar down to his waist?

But oh, what a glorious waist it was.

To indulge in scandalous gossip while enjoying the physique of an unfairly handsome man—this was truly the pinnacle of a perfect life. Could any other gossip enthusiast possibly be having a better time than me right now?

Evelyn was fully aware she was behaving like a shameless lecher. She knew she should stop—but Nathan's silent endurance, the way his breath hitched ever so slightly under her touch, only fueled her wicked desires.

She wanted to keep teasing him.

And more importantly, she wanted to do it without consequences.

Smug satisfaction curled in her chest—until she realized the man she was toying with had reached his limit.

In one swift motion, Nathan seized her wrist and pulled her flush against him, their breaths mingling in the scant space between them.

###Chapter 263 Can You Be A Little More Daring
Mind Games and Whispered Secrets
The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's luxurious penthouse as she sipped her coffee, scrolling through her phone. A slow smirk curled her lips.

Oh, this is delicious.

Her mind-reading ability—her best-kept secret—had just tuned into the most scandalous thoughts from none other than Victoria Hayes, Nathan Blackwood’s scheming secretary.

"If only Nathan would finally see me as more than just an assistant…" Victoria’s inner monologue dripped with desperation. "That Evelyn doesn’t deserve him. I could make him so much happier."

Evelyn nearly choked on her latte. Oh, sweetheart, you wish.

She leaned back, amusement dancing in her eyes. Victoria’s fantasies were laughably transparent—flimsy daydreams of stolen glances and whispered confessions in Nathan’s office. But then…

"Maybe if Evelyn had an… accident…"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her cup.

Oh, it’s on now.

She set her coffee down with deliberate calm. If Victoria wanted to play dirty, Evelyn would show her exactly how the game was won.

Her phone buzzed—a message from her agent, Serena Whitmore.

"Emergency meeting at Blackwood Media. Drama with the Montgomery account. Get here ASAP."

Evelyn’s smirk returned. Perfect timing. She’d deal with Victoria later.

But as she grabbed her coat, another thought slithered into her mind—this time from Nathan himself.

"I need to tell Evelyn the truth… before it’s too late."

Her breath hitched.

Truth? What truth?

The elevator doors closed before she could dig deeper.

And just like that, the day’s gossip turned deadly serious.

Evelyn met Nathan's gaze, his stormy gray eyes pulling her into their mesmerizing depths. An electric current of unspoken desire crackled between them, making the air thick with tension.

Evelyn stared at the impossibly handsome face mere inches from hers, her pulse racing like a wild stallion. Her gaze dropped to his slightly parted lips—soft, inviting, dangerously tempting. Without thinking, she swallowed hard.

Too close. If I lean forward just a little...

Nathan suddenly snapped out of his daze, realizing how dangerously close he was to crossing a line. No. I can't. Not unless Evelyn wants this too. To him, she held all the power—she could do anything to him, but he refused to take what wasn’t freely given.

What’s he thinking? Is he going to kiss me? Should I stop him... or not? Evelyn’s thoughts spiraled. If I tilt my head up now, our lips would—

Nathan exhaled sharply, his breath uneven.

Yet, despite the charged moment, neither dared to close that final gap. Both were prisoners of their own hesitation, drowning in what-ifs.

"Y-You okay?" Evelyn stammered, cheeks burning. "Did I... do something?"

Nathan’s lips twitched. Couldn’t my wife be a little bolder? But then again, he was no better.

"It’s nothing," he murmured, voice rough with restraint. "It’s late. We should rest." His body thrummed with need, but he refused to let it show—not when Evelyn might pull away.

Relieved he wasn’t pressing further, Evelyn quickly lay down with a soft "Mhm." Yet, the moment she settled, she instinctively turned and curled into Nathan’s side, her arm draping over his chest.

It felt right.

And since he hadn’t objected, she took it as permission.

Nathan switched off the lamp, plunging the room into shadows, though moonlight still painted faint outlines across the sheets.

Evelyn blinked up at him, her eyes luminous in the dim light.

"Close your eyes," he whispered.

She opened her mouth to speak, but before she could, Nathan leaned in and pressed a featherlight kiss to her forehead.

"Goodnight," he murmured, his voice a velvet caress.

Evelyn’s heart swelled.

"Goodnight," she whispered back.

They slept soundly, wrapped in warmth and quiet contentment.

Meanwhile, across the city, Vivian Moore and Gwendolyn Brooks were having a very different kind of night—one filled with restless pacing and bitter regrets.

The air between Vivian and Gwendolyn crackled with unspoken emotions as they sat across from each other, two sisters reunited after years of separation. The weight of their shared past hung heavy in the silence, demanding to be addressed.

Vivian didn’t hold back. She laid bare the ugly truth of their fractured family, her voice steady but laced with bitterness.

"Back then, our parents married for love," she began, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. "But our grandparents never approved. The difference in their social status was too great. So, they eloped. I was born soon after, and our grandparents had no choice but to accept the marriage—but only on one condition."

Gwendolyn leaned forward, her eyes wide. "What condition?"

Vivian’s lips twisted into a humorless smile. "Our father had to prove himself. He worked day and night, barely sleeping, just to meet their impossible expectations. And our mother? She couldn’t handle the loneliness. She couldn’t stand that he never had time for her. So, she ran back to her first love."

A sharp inhale from Gwendolyn.

Vivian continued, her voice dropping to a whisper. "When our father found out, she didn’t even hesitate. She packed her things and left—but not before making sure I wouldn’t slow her down."

With trembling hands, Vivian lifted the hem of her blouse, revealing a jagged scar along her waist. Gwendolyn gasped, her hand flying to her mouth.

"She pushed me down the stairs," Vivian said flatly. "I was just a child. The fall shattered my hip. This scar? It’s from the surgery that put me back together."

Gwendolyn’s eyes welled with tears, her breath hitching. She reached out, but Vivian pulled away, tucking the scar back beneath her clothes.

"You don’t have anything to say?" Vivian challenged, her voice brittle. "Even after hearing all this, you don’t doubt her?"

Gwendolyn swallowed hard, her gaze dropping to her lap. "I… I remember bits and pieces from when I was little. Maybe it’s karma, but their life after that was miserable. Always fighting. Always broke. She drank too much, and when she did, she’d cry about regrets." Hesitating, she rolled up her sleeve, revealing a faded scar of her own. "One night, she threw a wine bottle at me. Said if it weren’t for me—if it weren’t for the lies our father told—she could have gone back."

Vivian’s hands clenched into fists. "Back to him?"

Gwendolyn nodded.

"Disgusting," Vivian spat. "She had two daughters, and she couldn’t even love one of us properly. She was nothing but a selfish coward."

Gwendolyn flinched but didn’t argue. After all, their mother was long gone. There was no one left to defend.

The silence stretched between them, thick with pain and resentment.

Then, softly, Gwendolyn whispered, "Do you think we’ll ever stop hating her?"

Vivian’s answer was immediate. "No. And I don’t want to."

Because some scars never fade.

Unable to resist, Vivian embraced Gwendolyn.

"Sorry, Vivian." Gwendolyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Vivian immediately scoffed. "What kind of nonsense is that? The one who wronged me was that woman—what does any of this have to do with you? We're both just unlucky, stuck with the same wretched birth mother."

Gwendolyn let out a soft laugh. "At least she gave me an incredible sister."

For so long, she had believed herself utterly alone in this world. Then, out of nowhere, fate had handed her a sister like Vivian—strong, brilliant, and fiercely protective. It still felt surreal, like something out of a dream.

Vivian smirked. "True. The only decent thing she ever did was leave me with you."

Just then, the phone in Vivian’s hotel suite rang. Few people knew how to reach her here, which meant it was likely someone who had tried her cell first and failed.

Vivian stood, stretching lazily. "Probably my parents. They must’ve just woken up over there. I bet the news gave them quite the morning shock."

Gwendolyn tensed, her expression flickering with unease. She couldn’t help but dread facing Wren. In her mind, that man would surely despise her very existence.

Vivian caught the shift in her mood instantly. "Relax," she said, waving a hand dismissively. "You’re connected to me, not them."

"But revealing our relationship could damage the Graham family’s reputation," Gwendolyn argued quietly. Having been exposed to Grayson’s world, she understood these things all too well.

Vivian laughed. "When I got the DNA results, I already told them everything. Their exact words? ‘Your life, your rules.’"

With that, she picked up the phone. Sure enough, Wren’s deep, displeased voice rumbled through the line, layered with Grace’s softer, soothing murmurs in the background.

Vivian stuck out her tongue playfully at Gwendolyn before launching into her defense. "What’s the big deal? You said I could handle things my way."

"You never mentioned you’d be causing an international scandal!" Wren snapped. "If you’re so capable, clean up this mess yourself!"

Gwendolyn bit her lip, but Vivian just grinned, unfazed, and launched into placating her father.

Not once did Wren bring up Gwendolyn.

The truth was, Wren and Vivian had long since healed from their wounds, thanks to Grace’s unwavering love. But as far as Wren was concerned, the child that woman had borne outside their family was none of his concern. Still, he didn’t stop Vivian from doing as she pleased.

Meanwhile, Grace quietly asked after Gwendolyn’s well-being, and Vivian filled her in on the details. Grace’s heart ached for the girl, and her concern was genuine.

"She's with me—we're forming an unbreakable sisterly bond. Don't worry, I'll protect her. No one dares mess with my little sister," Vivian teased, her laughter light and infectious. Then, with a mischievous glint in her eyes, she turned to her mother. "Mom, now that I have a sister, when are you going to give me a baby brother?"

"What kind of nonsense are you spouting, child!" her mother scolded, though her lips twitched with suppressed amusement.

Vivian grinned, undeterred. "Did I say something wrong? All I meant was, now that I have Gwendolyn, you don’t need to worry about me being lonely anymore. So, please—give me a little brother!" Her laughter rang out again, bright and carefree.

Gwendolyn felt warmth spread through her chest. The way Vivian and her family embraced her so effortlessly made her heart swell. She hadn’t expected such open acceptance, but here she was, caught up in their laughter, their teasing, their love.

If they really did have a baby brother one day—even if he wasn’t related to her by blood—she knew she’d adore him just as fiercely.

###Chapter 264 Enthralled By Her Radiance

The golden chandeliers of the Blackwood estate cast shimmering reflections across the marble floors as Evelyn Sinclair adjusted the emerald pendant at her throat. Her fingers trembled slightly - not from the autumn chill creeping through the French windows, but from the weight of Nathan Blackwood's gaze burning into her back.

"Must you leave so soon?" His voice, dark as aged whiskey, curled around her like smoke. The scent of his cologne - bergamot and something dangerously masculine - made her pulse stutter.

Evelyn turned slowly, the silk of her midnight-blue gown whispering against her thighs. "The gala starts in forty minutes, and Victoria will have my head if I'm late to my own book launch." She forced a smile, though her stomach twisted at the thought of facing Nathan's predatory secretary.

Nathan stepped closer, his tailored tuxedo emphasizing shoulders that could carry empires. Moonlight caught the silver at his temples as he lifted a hand toward her face. "Let her wait." His thumb brushed her lower lip, smearing the berry-colored stain. "I've been waiting six years for this moment."

Beyond the terrace, Manhattan glittered like a spilled jewelry box. Evelyn's breath hitched when Nathan's other hand settled possessively at her waist. The heat of his palm seared through layers of chiffon and silk.

"Six years," he murmured against her temple, "since you walked out of my life wearing that same damn perfume." His lips traced the shell of her ear. "Jasmine and trouble."

A crash from the foyer shattered the moment. "Ms. Sinclair!" Lillian Graves's panicked voice preceded the assistant's frantic footsteps. "The florist sent peonies instead of gardenias, and Mr. Donovan just arrived with—oh!" She skidded to a stop, cheeks flaming at the intimate scene.

Nathan didn't remove his hands. "Tell Marcus Donovan he can cool his heels with the rest of the vultures."

Evelyn extricated herself with practiced grace, though her knees threatened to buckle. "We'll continue this... conversation later." She smoothed her dress, avoiding Nathan's knowing smirk. "Lillian, let's handle the flowers. And for God's sake, keep Preston Whitmore away from the champagne this time."

As she swept toward the chaos of pre-gala preparations, Evelyn resisted the urge to glance back. Nathan's presence was a physical weight between her shoulder blades, as tangible as the emerald pendant warming against her skin - his first gift, given the night everything fell apart.

Somewhere beyond the ballroom, a string quartet began tuning their instruments. The melody twisted like a knife between Evelyn's ribs. Six years ago, this same song had played as she walked away from Nathan Blackwood. Tonight, it would play as she walked back into his arms - or his trap.

She touched the pendant again. Either way, the game was far from over.

When Evelyn stirred awake, she found herself enveloped in a cocoon of warmth.

Her nose brushed against the firm planes of his chest, inhaling the intoxicating scent that clung to him—a mix of sandalwood and something uniquely Nathan.

A soft sigh escaped her lips.

Then, a tickle teased her nose, and instinctively, she nuzzled deeper against him, only to feel him shift slightly away.

Blinking sleepily, she lifted her gaze—

And froze.

The face above her was nothing short of breathtaking. Sharp jawline, tousled dark hair, and those piercing eyes that seemed to see straight through her.

Oh God.

Memories of last night flooded back—her shameless demands, the way she’d clung to him like a limpet. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

She wasn’t prone to insomnia, but sleep quality varied.

Yet, in both her lifetimes, she’d never slept so soundly.

Nathan was like a living, breathing sedative.

"Morning," he murmured, his voice rough with sleep, sending shivers down her spine.

They adjusted positions, and Evelyn reluctantly extricated herself from his arms.

But when she got a proper look at his face—pale, almost green—her embarrassment flared anew.

"Not used to sharing a bed? Didn’t sleep well?"

He hesitated, then offered a strained smile. "No, I slept fine. Better than when I’m alone."

Evelyn arched a brow. This was his idea of well-rested?

Truthfully, Nathan hadn’t slept a wink. Thank God Evelyn couldn’t peek into his mind—otherwise, his lie would’ve crumbled instantly.

It wasn’t the sharing that was the problem.

It was her.

Evelyn was a restless sleeper. Tossing, turning, and worst of all—clingy.

She’d latched onto him like ivy, arms and legs tangled around him in a vice grip.

At first, it was endearing.

Then, it became torture.

He’d actually gotten up at one point, needing space to… compose himself.

Never in his life had he felt so undignified.

And the moment he’d returned?

She’d coiled around him again, leaving him utterly helpless.

Now, as she studied him with those wide, innocent eyes, he fought the urge to groan.

This woman would be the death of him.

Nathan had just barely managed to suppress his natural morning reaction when Evelyn stirred awake beside him, and instantly, his self-control teetered on the edge.

Of course, he couldn’t blame his wife—this was entirely his own weakness.

"Ah!"

Evelyn suddenly gasped, jolting upright.

"What's wrong?" Nathan was already halfway out of bed when he heard her, his pulse spiking with concern. Had he lost control last night? Had he left a mark on her delicate skin? He’d checked—discreetly—and found nothing. He hadn’t dared to be rough, after all.

"It's already nine-thirty!" Evelyn exclaimed, eyes wide. "You're late for work!"

Normally, by the time Evelyn woke, Nathan was already buried in paperwork at the office. Their mornings never aligned.

"It's fine," Nathan assured her.

He’d been awake for hours, but he’d made a promise. He wouldn’t disturb her sleep, not when she was curled so perfectly against him.

Evelyn blinked at him, stunned.

Was this really Nathan Blackwood? The man who lived and breathed business? The workaholic who never took a day off? Had she truly bewitched him so completely? If he neglected his empire for her, what would happen to his fortune?

Nathan sighed, reading her thoughts. So money still matters to her, huh?

Amused, he stepped closer and tapped her forehead lightly.

"Since you're awake, get up. We’ll have breakfast together. And don’t worry—I’ll leave for the office right after."

Evelyn let out a dry chuckle.

Nathan’s belongings were in his own room, so he had to leave. But before he did, he hesitated, then asked, "Did you sleep well last night?"

Evelyn, now standing and stretching, nodded. "Best sleep I’ve had in ages."

Nathan lingered by the door, his fingers resting on the knob. He didn’t dare look at her as he murmured, "So… should I come back tomorrow? To be your personal pillow?"

Evelyn paused, surprised. She’d assumed last night was a one-time indulgence.

His offer was undeniably tempting.

After a beat, she finally answered, "Alright. Sure."

Nathan exhaled in relief.

Since Evelyn still seemed hesitant, Nathan chose not to push for moving his belongings in just yet. For now, it was enough that he could visit every night to be her personal pillow.

He was confident that, given time, Evelyn would gradually open her heart to him.

When the two descended the stairs together, the entire Blackwood family was watching intently. Even Sophia, who should have left for work by now, had deliberately stayed behind—just to witness this rare sight.

After all, it wasn’t like Nathan to still be lounging around at this hour instead of heading to the office.

Had something actually happened last night? Was that why he overslept?

But seeing Evelyn’s calm, composed expression—her mind clearly preoccupied with thoughts of Vivian and Gwendolyn’s situation—they quickly realized nothing had occurred.

The disappointed, judgmental stares from Richard, Margaret, and Sophia bore into Nathan, making him falter mid-step, heat creeping up his neck.

Left with no other outlet, the trio vented their frustrations in their private group chat.

Afterward, they happily settled at the dining table with Evelyn and Nathan, chatting over breakfast.

Even though Evelyn used to keep erratic hours, the Blackwoods had always made sure she never ate alone. Someone would always join her, even if just for tea. They refused to let her feel isolated.

As they exchanged the latest gossip, Evelyn’s inner reflections gave them insight into recent developments.

Vivian and Gwendolyn had finally made peace. The sisters had talked late into the night, until exhaustion claimed them. They’d even fallen asleep curled up together, like they used to as children.

As for Grayson—well, the only casualty seemed to be his pride. Shockingly, Lila’s family had caused a scene, demanding he marry her. They accused him of toying with her affections. Given his already ruined reputation, they argued, a marriage alliance would be the best solution.

The Blackwoods exchanged glances. Seriously? Would Lila even want Grayson now?

Nathan was certain Grayson would never agree.

The Hart family, however, had actually started considering it. They knew Grayson’s actions last night had infuriated the Moores, making him the laughingstock of their social circle. At this point, no respectable family would let their daughter marry him. Lila, at least, was infatuated—she’d stand by him unconditionally.

The Blackwoods sighed. Hard to say if Grayson deserves pity or not.

The Harts had planned to take Grayson to meet Lila and discuss the marriage. But in a twist no one saw coming, Grayson escaped through a window mid-meeting, leaving behind a note: I’d rather die than marry someone I don’t love. Unfortunately, he broke his leg in the process, effectively ending all discussions.

The Blackwoods blinked. Well… that’s tragic. But also kind of hilarious. What even is his life?

Nathan felt the beginnings of a tension headache creeping in. It appeared he would need to carve out time that afternoon to handle the unfortunate situation.

Sure enough, when he checked his phone, a message from Daniel was already waiting. The news had spread, and Daniel wanted Nathan to join him for a visit.

When Nathan asked Evelyn if she wished to accompany them, she declined. She remembered how Grayson had once teased her relentlessly about her metaphysical beliefs. If she went now, he might blame her for his misfortunes, and that would only invite unnecessary drama.

Before heading to the office, Nathan made a brief stop, offering a few words of sympathy before hurrying off to focus on his work.

The rumor mill had spun wildly—simply because it was so rare for Nathan to be late. The reason? He had overslept. Nathan wasn’t one to fabricate excuses, so the truth had to be genuine.

Could it be that even the unshakable Nathan Blackwood had been so captivated by a woman’s allure that he lost track of time?

His employees refused to believe he’d overslept alone. They were convinced his tardiness could only mean one thing—he’d been with his wife.

Whispers about the couple’s deepening affection spread like wildfire. Some even started placing bets on when their wedding would finally take place.

Little did they know, Nathan was just getting started.

Yet after that incident, he was never late again. Evelyn had firmly declared herself a heavy sleeper, assuring him he could wake up whenever he pleased.

Though leaving the warmth of her embrace was agonizing, he knew exactly what his greatest advantage was in Evelyn’s eyes.

A few days later, Evelyn found herself back at Blackwood Group.

This time, she had a legitimate reason—she was meeting Nathan after work so they could shop together for Beatrice’s engagement gift.

The second-floor balcony was a hotspot for unexpected encounters.

While Nathan was in a meeting, Evelyn sipped her coffee, enjoying the view. A burst of laughter drew her attention as a group strolled in, chatting animatedly.

"Mr. Moore, don’t worry. Ms. Sterling will absolutely be our top choice for the lead role in this project."

"No need to prioritize her. I’m quite close with Mr. Blackwood. Honestly, this minor issue isn’t even worth mentioning."

Evelyn frowned.

Turning, she spotted a man who bore a faint resemblance to Lucas, his arm draped possessively around a woman dressed in a scandalously tight dress, her expression sharp and calculating.

Her identity was unmistakable.

The whispers had begun again.

Evelyn Sinclair could feel the weight of countless gazes burning into her back as she walked through the grand hall of the Blackwood estate. The air was thick with unspoken words, the kind that slithered between champagne flutes and polished smiles.

Oh, gossip.

No—that wasn’t quite right.

Nathan Blackwood’s sharp-tongued sister, Sophia, had once remarked that this level of scrutiny wasn’t mere gossip anymore. It was something far more insidious. Something that clung to Evelyn’s every move like a second skin.

She adjusted the strap of her emerald-green gown, the silk whispering against her skin. The dress was daring—cut low in the back, the fabric shimmering under the chandelier’s glow. She had chosen it deliberately.

Let them stare.

Let them whisper.

She wasn’t the same woman who had stumbled into this world of old money and sharper tongues.

Nathan’s presence was a storm brewing at the edge of the room. He stood near the towering windows, his dark suit a stark contrast to the golden light spilling in from the gardens. His gaze, heavy and unreadable, tracked her every step.

Evelyn tilted her chin up.

She wasn’t afraid of him.

Not anymore.

A server offered her a flute of champagne, and she accepted it with a practiced smile. The bubbles danced on her tongue, crisp and cold.

Perfect.

Just like the plan unfolding in her mind.

Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s ever-loyal secretary, watched her from across the room. Her lips were pressed into a thin line, her fingers clenched around her own glass.

Evelyn smirked.

Oh, Victoria. You have no idea what’s coming.

The music swelled, a haunting melody that wrapped around the guests like a velvet glove.

Nathan pushed away from the window.

He moved with the lethal grace of a predator, his steps measured, deliberate.

Evelyn didn’t flinch.

She met him halfway.

The room held its breath.

“You’re playing a dangerous game,” he murmured, his voice rough, his breath warm against her ear.

Evelyn laughed, low and throaty.

“Darling,” she purred, tracing the rim of her glass with one fingertip. “I’m just getting started.”

And then—just like that—she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him standing there, his jaw tight, his eyes burning.

The whispers erupted behind her.

Let them talk.

She had a empire to build.

And Nathan Blackwood?

He was just another piece on the board.

###Chapter 265 Always The Ultimate Coward
Whispers of Scandal in Evelyn's Mind

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her plush velvet sofa, her fingers idly scrolling through her phone. The latest tabloid headlines flashed across the screen, each one more scandalous than the last.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman!"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Her grip on the phone tightened as she zoomed in on the grainy photo. The man in question was unmistakably Nathan—tall, broad-shouldered, with that infuriatingly perfect jawline. But the woman clinging to his arm? A stranger. A stunning, raven-haired stranger.

Her stomach twisted.

She shouldn’t care. After all, she and Nathan were nothing more than business partners now. Their whirlwind romance had ended months ago, buried under a mountain of misunderstandings and pride. But logic had no place in the storm of emotions raging inside her.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Come in," she called, hastily locking her phone.

Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped inside, balancing a tray of coffee and a stack of contracts. "Morning, Ms. Sinclair. You have a meeting with Preston Whitmore in an hour, and Donovan Sharpe wants to discuss the new project budget."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thanks, Lillian. I’ll be ready."

As the door clicked shut, she exhaled sharply. Work. She needed to focus on work. Not on Nathan’s latest escapade. Not on the way his laughter used to make her heart skip.

But then her phone buzzed again.

A message from an unknown number.

"Ask Nathan about Adriana Prescott. I think you’ll find the story… enlightening."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Adriana Prescott? As in Daniel Prescott’s wife? The same Daniel who was married to Nathan’s sister, Sophia?

This wasn’t just gossip.

This was a bomb waiting to detonate.

And she had no idea if she should light the fuse—or run for cover.

This was Evelyn's first encounter with Caleb. Though he bore some resemblance to Lucas, his demeanor screamed spoiled rich kid with zero substance.

Nathan had mentioned the Moores to her before.

The Moore family had thrived in business due to their unique philosophy—family above all. Internal power struggles were rare, as they believed the most capable should lead.

Currently, the family was helmed by Caleb's mother, Lydia Sanders.

Caleb's father, Richard Bennett, was the second son—utterly ordinary and content to live in his wife's shadow while indulging in hobbies. Their marriage had been arranged by the family, who recognized Lydia's potential early on. Over the years, she'd proven herself, making her word law within the Moore household.

Mrs. Lydia's only failure is this waste of space she calls a son, Evelyn mused. No wonder she shipped him off to dabble in entertainment projects while entrusting the real business to Lucas. Meritocracy indeed.

Lucas was Caleb's cousin, son of the eldest Moore son. His father, Jared Moore, had passed young, and his mother remarried, leaving him somewhat orphaned within the family. Yet given the empire he was inheriting, it was clear the Moores saw him as their future.

From her vantage point, Evelyn watched Caleb slide into his seat, his hand creeping onto Luna's thigh when he thought no one noticed. A pang of pity struck her for Beatrice. How does she stomach being married to this? Even in a loveless arrangement, this is vile.

Her thoughts circled back to Lucas.

He'd loved Beatrice for a decade. But raised by his aunt Lydia—who trusted him with the family legacy—he couldn't bring himself to compete with Caleb for the woman Lydia wanted as her daughter-in-law. To Lucas, it would've been a betrayal. So he'd buried his feelings, watching the love of his life become his cousin's wife.

Evelyn clenched her fists. Coward.

It was a business marriage. Had Lucas fought, he might've won—Beatrice had openly stated she was only marrying to secure the families' alliance. The groom's identity hardly mattered.

Yet out of loyalty, Lucas had surrendered.

Pathetic, Evelyn thought. If that's love, it's weaker than I imagined.

The situation wasn't as tragic as star-crossed lovers—after all, Evelyn wasn't coerced, nor did she harbor any feelings for Lucas.

In truth, Evelyn had no idea that after her accidental outburst at home, the Blackwood family had eagerly persuaded Nathan to speak with Lucas. They hoped Lucas and Beatrice could become a couple.

They were all Nathan's friends. Since Beatrice didn’t object, marrying someone who adored her was surely better than being tied to a man who chased after celebrities. Though Beatrice only wanted a marriage in name, wedding a man with such a notorious reputation would undoubtedly invite endless trouble.

Moreover, they believed that given the Thornton family’s principles, things might not escalate too badly. It was Lucas who had let so-called obligations bind his hands.

On this matter, Nathan shared the same stance as Evelyn—he wouldn’t interfere in affairs that didn’t concern him. However, if it were similar to Daniel’s situation—where he had been deceived—he wouldn’t hesitate to step in for a friend.

But this was a conscious decision made by Lucas and Beatrice. Both were adults, and any consequences were theirs to bear.

Evelyn remained entirely indifferent to the whole affair.

Meanwhile, Caleb was still making things difficult for the staff. Evelyn had already deduced that their vague excuses were merely attempts to placate him. Entertainment companies under Blackwood Group had strict project requirements—even Evelyn had never been allowed shortcuts in the past, let alone others.

No matter how hard Evelyn scrutinized the woman beside Caleb—whose face was clearly the result of multiple cosmetic procedures—she couldn’t picture her as the lead actress.

Caleb still insisted on pretending he was close to Nathan.

Evelyn smirked. Your cousin and your fiancée might be acquainted with Nathan, but he’s never even met you. The audacity.

Nathan had never been one for social niceties. He wouldn’t bother with anyone who wasn’t a potential business partner or competitor.

The staff, however, were in a tight spot. Though Caleb came off as a spoiled heir, he was still a member of the Thornton family—and he did have a personal connection to Nathan.

Evelyn pitied the employees, who lived in constant fear of offending someone over a misunderstanding and bearing the full brunt of the blame. Other than offering vague responses, they couldn’t give a definitive answer.

Unfortunately, they’d have to give Caleb one eventually.

Sweat beaded on their foreheads as they scrambled for a solution.

Evelyn stood and strode toward them. "You must be Mr. Moore, correct?"

The sudden appearance of a poised, striking woman instantly seized Caleb’s attention. His hand, which had been resting on Luna’s thigh, froze mid-motion.

If she's this stunning and calling me Mr. Moore, she must be someone important. Probably another aspiring actress looking for connections.

Caleb had been through this scenario too many times. His first instinct was to flash a charming smile and say, "Well, hello there. And who might you be?"

He even rose from his seat, extending his hand for a polite shake.

The staff member, however, recognized Evelyn immediately. They'd seen her without makeup enough times to know better than to mistake her for just another pretty face.

Caleb did find her vaguely familiar, but her effortless beauty and casual demeanor made him assume she was a fresh-faced university graduate trying to break into the industry. Naturally, he slipped into his usual "successful businessman" persona.

Evelyn arched a brow, amused. "Oh? You don’t recognize me? I just overheard you claiming to know my husband quite well. Strange that you wouldn’t know me."

Caleb froze. Before he could process her words, the staff member had already stood and greeted her respectfully. "Good afternoon, Mrs. Blackwood."

"Mrs. Blackwood? Which Mrs. Blackwood?" Luna, who had been clinging to Caleb’s arm, suddenly spoke up, her tone dripping with skepticism.

The staff members exchanged glances, their confidence bolstered. After all, their CEO’s wife wasn’t just any woman—she was the infamous Gossip Queen, a force to be reckoned with in the entertainment world. They knew she wouldn’t let this slide.

"This is Mrs. Blackwood, our CEO’s wife. Surely you recognize her, Mr. Moore?" The staff member smirked, enjoying the moment.

"Evelyn?!" The realization hit Caleb like a freight train. He’d seen pictures of her in the media, but the woman standing before him was a completely different kind of breathtaking.

Meanwhile, Luna gave Evelyn a slow, disdainful once-over, her lips curling in obvious contempt.

Evelyn hadn’t paid Luna much attention at first, but the girl’s blatant disrespect was impossible to ignore. The way she rolled her eyes—even after learning Evelyn’s identity—piqued Evelyn’s curiosity instantly. A quick mental scan revealed Luna’s true background.

Oh? I thought she was just another one of Caleb’s flings. Turns out she’s Nathan’s persistent little nuisance.

When Nathan heard his wife was in the building, he rushed over the moment his meeting ended. But the second he stepped inside, he was met with Evelyn’s sharp, accusing thoughts.

Nathan blinked, utterly baffled.

###Chapter 266: The Juicy Thoughts in Her Mind

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still half-lost in the remnants of last night’s dream. A smirk curled at the corner of her lips as she recalled the scandalous whispers she had overheard in her mind—again.

Ever since she had gained this bizarre ability to read people’s most private thoughts, life had become infinitely more entertaining. And today? Oh, today promised to be particularly juicy.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Nathan Blackwood, her infuriatingly charming yet equally frustrating business rival—and, if she were being honest with herself, the man who had been occupying far too much of her thoughts lately.

"Meeting at ten. Don’t be late."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. As if she needed him to remind her. But then—her smirk widened—she caught the unspoken thought lingering beneath his words.

"And wear that red dress. The one that makes it impossible to focus."

Oh, Nathan.

She tossed her phone aside and swung her legs out of bed, already plotting. If he wanted a show, she’d give him one. But first, coffee. And gossip.

Downstairs, her assistant, Lillian Graves, was already waiting with a fresh cup of espresso and a stack of tabloids.

"You’re in a good mood," Lillian observed, raising an eyebrow.

Evelyn took a sip, savoring the rich bitterness. "You have no idea."

Because while Nathan’s thoughts had been amusing, they were nothing compared to the absolute chaos brewing in the minds of the elite socialites she’d be seeing at today’s charity gala. Affairs, betrayals, secret deals—oh, the things people thought when they believed no one was listening.

And Evelyn? She was always listening.

She flipped open the first tabloid, her eyes skimming the headlines with detached amusement. But her mind was already elsewhere, replaying the most scandalous tidbits she’d plucked from unsuspecting minds.

Tonight was going to be fun.

And if Nathan thought he could distract her with a red dress? Well.

She’d make sure he regretted it.

The moment Nathan stepped into the room, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. His long strides quickened until he was nearly jogging to reach her side.

"Evelyn." Nathan's deep voice came from behind her. Without waiting for anyone's reaction, he immediately claimed her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers. "Forgive me for making you wait."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

Speak of the devil.

With his striking features and commanding presence, it was no wonder women flocked to him wherever he went.

Nathan's lips twitched.

Is my wife... complimenting me?

"Nathan, what a coincidence," Caleb Moore remarked, though his tone carried an edge of discomfort.

Only then did Nathan turn his attention to him, his expression hardening. "What are you doing here?"

His voice held none of the warmth one might expect between acquaintances—only cold suspicion.

Nathan had learned earlier that the Bennetts and Moores were supposed to be at a private gathering today. Caleb should have been with Beatrice Holloway, not here.

Catching Nathan's icy tone, Caleb bristled. He had always considered himself Nathan's equal and assumed the other man simply disliked him—especially since Nathan was close to Lucas Thornton, a cousin Caleb despised.

"We came to discuss a collaboration," Caleb announced, his voice dripping with condescension. "But your staff is utterly incompetent. Their inefficiency is appalling. They insisted on consulting you over trivial matters." He smirked. "Given our history, I assumed you'd handle it personally. Perhaps you should train your employees better, Mr. Blackwood."

At his words, the wallpaper installer froze, his hands tightening around his tools. He had done nothing wrong—yet here he was, being publicly humiliated.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed.

So, he thinks name-dropping their social circles means he doesn’t have to explain himself? That Nathan will just bend to his whims out of respect for the Bennetts? And now he’s using this as an excuse to punish an innocent employee who simply didn’t grovel at his feet?

Her blood boiled. I despise entitled men like him.

Nathan caught her thoughts and silently agreed. If my wife hates it, then so do I.

"What exactly is this trivial matter?" Nathan turned to the employee, his voice calm but firm.

The man hesitated, unsure if he should speak up.

"Go ahead," Evelyn encouraged gently, offering him a reassuring smile.

Relieved, the employee quickly recounted the earlier exchange.

The audition results were determined under fair conditions. Naturally, if Luna's performance matched the other actresses', her casting—which came with additional investment—would be the obvious choice.

Caleb's expression darkened instantly upon hearing this.

It suddenly struck him that he'd been patronized by a junior employee.

What infuriated him more was that, as a member of the prestigious Moore family and CEO of a major entertainment conglomerate, his influence should have outweighed some random employee's. Yet, Nathan and Evelyn had the audacity to question and dismiss him.

After listening to the exchange, Nathan turned to the junior employee. "At Blackwood Group, we don't operate on personal favors. Everything is handled with professionalism and fairness."

This had always been Nathan's principle. A corporation that relied on nepotism would inevitably rot from within. His leadership had propelled Blackwood Group to unprecedented success precisely because he refused to compromise on integrity.

Still, human nature being what it was, such incidents were unavoidable. Only critical matters under Nathan's direct supervision remained untarnished. This project, being a subsidiary's affair, was why they were even entertaining Caleb's demands instead of outright rejecting him.

The employee was sharp. He recognized Nathan's words as approval of his stance—assurance that no influential figure's complaint would cost him his job.

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood." The employee's admiration for Nathan was palpable.

Meanwhile, Caleb's face had turned stormy. "And what about my reputation?" he snapped, incredulous. These were people who'd be attending his engagement party in days!

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, didn’t you know? I was once signed under Blackwood Group. No matter how much I begged my husband, he refused to pull strings for me. It wasn’t until I struck out on my own that I earned my success." Her tone dripped with sarcasm. "If I couldn’t sway him, what makes you think you can?"

Nathan shot her a look, caught between pride and chagrin.

Now, of course, he'd give Evelyn anything she wanted. He wasn’t inflexible—just fiercely principled. But back then? Not a chance.

Caleb seethed but couldn’t retaliate, forced to swallow his fury under their united front.

Then Luna finally spoke, adopting a pitiful, pleading tone. "Nate, won’t you help me? This is my first major film! Can’t you make an exception?"

Evelyn nearly gagged. Nate? Goosebumps prickled her skin. Did she really just try that after I explicitly said he wouldn’t even help his own wife? This was a blatant challenge—a love rival testing boundaries.

Nathan stiffened slightly, reading Evelyn's thoughts. Unwanted admirer? His lips twitched.

Nathan Blackwood studied the unfamiliar woman before him, his brows knitting together in confusion. "Who are you?" His voice was cool, edged with irritation. "Mind your manners. That casual address is inappropriate."

Two distinct giggles erupted—one from Evelyn Sinclair, the other from the junior assistant who failed to suppress her amusement at the unfolding scene.

Luna Morgan's face paled further than Caleb Moore's, as though Nathan's words had physically struck her. She swayed slightly, her eyes welling up with unshed tears.

"Nate, you—"

"That nickname is off-limits," Nathan cut in sharply, his tone hardening.

"Nathan, are you serious?" Caleb, despite noticing Luna's obvious ulterior motives toward Nathan, found himself bristling on her behalf.

Evelyn, however, found the situation increasingly bizarre. Nathan wasn’t the type to feign ignorance—unless he genuinely didn’t recognize her.

Strange. Even if they aren’t close, he should at least know her. He doesn’t have face blindness. Isn’t Luna Lucas Thornton’s half-sister from his mother’s remarriage? She stifled another laugh. Ah, the tangled webs of high-society families.

Nathan blinked, momentarily stunned by Evelyn’s silent commentary.

Then, realization dawned. "You’re Lucas’s sister?"

They had met before, but her name had clearly slipped his mind.

Luna’s face lit up with hope—until Nathan tilted his head and remarked, puzzled, "Your face looks... different."

"Pfft—"

This time, only Evelyn failed to contain her laughter, while the assistant bit her lip hard enough to draw blood.

Luna’s complexion cycled through shades of crimson and chalk-white. She had undergone extensive cosmetic enhancements—face, body, the works. Yet she never imagined her pursuit of beauty would backfire so spectacularly.

Summoning what dignity she had left, she twirled playfully. "It’s the latest trend. Don’t you think I’ve improved, Nate?"

Nathan didn’t hesitate. Out of respect for Lucas, he chose diplomacy. "Your surgeon needs better taste."

###Chapter 267: The Unexpected Ally

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the delicate china teacup in her hands. She took a slow sip, savoring the warmth of the Earl Grey, her mind still replaying last night’s confrontation with Nathan Blackwood.

How dare he?

Her fingers tightened around the cup. Nathan had always been infuriatingly stubborn, but last night had crossed a line. His cold dismissal of her concerns, the way his storm-gray eyes had darkened with that infuriating arrogance—it made her blood boil.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“Miss Sinclair?” Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped inside, holding a sleek tablet. “Victoria Hayes is here to see you.”

Evelyn’s lips curled into a smirk. Perfect timing.

“Send her in.”

Victoria strode into the room with the confidence of a woman who knew she held power. Her tailored navy suit accentuated her sharp features, and the glint in her hazel eyes was unmistakable—she was here for a fight.

“Evelyn,” she greeted coolly.

“Victoria,” Evelyn replied, setting her cup down with deliberate calm. “To what do I owe this unexpected visit?”

Victoria didn’t bother with pleasantries. “You’re interfering in matters that don’t concern you.”

Evelyn arched a brow. “Oh? And which matters would those be?”

“Nathan’s business.”

A slow, knowing smile spread across Evelyn’s lips. “Ah. So he sent you to do his dirty work?”

Victoria’s jaw tightened. “He doesn’t even know I’m here.”

Interesting.

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, studying her rival. “Then why are you?”

Victoria’s gaze flickered—just for a second—before hardening again. “Because whatever game you’re playing, it ends now.”

Evelyn laughed, a melodic sound that held no warmth. “Oh, Victoria. You’ve always been so dramatic.” She stood, smoothing the silk of her blouse. “But if you’re here to threaten me, let me save you the trouble. I don’t respond well to threats.”

Victoria took a step closer, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. “Stay away from Nathan.”

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. “Or what?”

The tension between them crackled like static before a storm.

Then, Victoria did something unexpected.

She smirked.

“Or you’ll regret it.”

Before Evelyn could respond, Victoria turned on her heel and strode out, leaving behind the faint scent of her expensive perfume and a challenge hanging in the air.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her fingers curling into fists.

Game on.

Outside, the city buzzed with life, unaware of the battle lines being redrawn in the shadows.

And Evelyn Sinclair had never been one to back down from a fight.

At this point, Luna couldn’t hold back any longer, her voice trembling as she asked, “Do you find me unattractive, Nathan?”

Evelyn nearly scoffed aloud. Good heavens! Lucas is as cunning as a fox, but how is his sister this dense? She’s practically begging to be humiliated at this point. A part of her was relieved that Beatrice and Lucas weren’t meant to be—dealing with a sister-in-law like Luna would be exhausting.

Nathan, though appearing to carefully weigh his words, delivered them with icy precision. “You lack distinctiveness. In this industry, uniqueness is an artist’s greatest asset. Your expressions, your speech—they’ve become painfully artificial. Don’t waste your time auditioning for this role. Our most basic requirement is a face that moves naturally.”

Evelyn bit back a laugh. Nathan really has a talent for crushing young women’s spirits.

Sure enough, the next second, Luna fled the room, tears streaming down her face.

Nathan blinked, genuinely perplexed. He had merely stated facts—no malice intended.

“Luna!” Caleb’s expression darkened instantly. “Nathan, it seems you’ve forgotten how to respect anyone from the Bennett family.”

Evelyn feigned shock. “Wait, she’s a Bennett? I thought her last name was Reed?”

Caleb stiffened, clearly flustered. With the recklessness of someone who’d never been denied anything, he snapped, “Do you want me to remove you from my engagement party guest list?”

Oh, here we go, Evelyn thought, amused. The classic tantrum of a spoiled heir. Does he really think that threat holds any weight?

As expected, Nathan’s expression turned glacial.

“Our invitation was delivered by Mrs. Bennett’s personal assistant,” Nathan said coolly. “If you’re so opposed to our attendance, Mr. Moore, perhaps I should call her and clarify.”

The invitation hadn’t come from Lucas or Beatrice—it had been sent directly by Mrs. Bennett herself, a gesture of mutual respect between two powerful families. If she found out Caleb was making a scene like this, she’d likely drag him back by the ear to apologize.

Caleb paled, his face cycling through a spectrum of emotions before he finally gritted out, “Attend if you want.” Then, like a coward, he turned on his heel and fled.

Evelyn and Nathan exchanged a glance, silently agreeing the fool wasn’t worth another thought. They had gifts to buy, after all.

But as they turned to leave, an unexpected voice called out.

“Wait.”

They turned to see Vivian Grant stepping forward, a small, knowing smile on her lips. “I couldn’t help but overhear. If you’re looking for a natural actress for your project… I might have a suggestion.”

Evelyn raised a brow. Now this was an interesting twist.

"All right," Nathan replied as he drove.


"I'm already disgusted on Beatrice's behalf for ending up with such a fiancé," Evelyn complained. "If he doesn't care about his fiancée, why agree to the engagement in the first place? I thought this brat would be more rebellious."

"He is rebellious—just not toward Mrs. Harrison," Nathan explained. "Besides, Beatrice was the one Mrs. Harrison personally approved."

This was new gossip to Evelyn, who immediately turned to look at Nathan with interest. "Go on," she urged.

"Beatrice has a steady personality—no drama, no trouble. At best, marrying her might help Caleb mature. At worst, she won’t make a scene over his misbehavior. Mrs. Harrison knows their marriage is transactional, so it’s not like Beatrice is wasting her time. It’s a practical arrangement. She doesn’t expect Beatrice to manage the family business, nor will she interfere with her freedom. As long as they live peacefully and produce heirs, that’s enough."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Sounds like they'll have the perfect mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship."

"Mrs. Harrison is reasonable, much like Beatrice. They laid everything out clearly during negotiations and actually got along well. As long as Mrs. Harrison is alive, Beatrice’s future is secure."

Evelyn mentally noted: So even if Lucas takes over later, Beatrice will still be protected. Interesting. But the real intrigue was Caleb and Luna’s relationship.

Nathan frowned. What relationship? Still, seeing them together had surprised him. Given the bad blood between Lucas and Caleb, he’d assumed Caleb would despise Luna too. Yet here he was, supporting her career. Wait—why would he skip a family gathering just to accompany Luna?

Just as Nathan was lost in thought, his phone rang. He gestured for Evelyn to answer.

Seeing the caller ID, Evelyn hesitated. "Given that you just insulted his little sister, is he calling to yell at you?"

Nathan chuckled. "Don’t worry. He won’t."

Skeptical, Evelyn answered—only to hear Lucas’s exasperated voice. "Luna just called me sobbing and ranted for ten minutes. What’s this about you calling her ugly? Sure, plastic surgery isn’t ideal, but she did it to look better. You’ve learned to treat your wife well—why are you still so harsh with other women? Where’s your chivalry?"

It was no secret that while Lucas inherited the striking looks of the Bennett family, Luna took after their father’s plain features. Naturally, no one in their family objected to her cosmetic procedures.

"It’s me," Evelyn said.

Lucas laughed. "Ah, right—these days, Nathan might not be the only one answering his phone. My bad. Should’ve asked first. Did you two run into my sister together? She didn’t offend you, did she?"

The lingering awkwardness from their previous encounter had completely dissipated, replaced by an effortless grace and casual ease between them.

“You guessed correctly,” Evelyn admitted without hesitation.

“It wasn’t difficult to deduce. Let me be frank—my sister had an unrequited crush on your husband. He rejected her years ago, but she’s never been one to surrender easily. Honestly, I suspect her endless cosmetic procedures stem from her lingering feelings for Nathan. But rest assured, I have no intention of playing matchmaker for them,” Lucas said bluntly.

Evelyn arched a brow. “When you two first met, I wasn’t even his wife yet. I’m surprised you didn’t consider keeping the benefits within your own family.”

“I did consider it,” Lucas admitted with a dry chuckle. “But I’m neither blind nor foolish. She’s my sister, yes, but unless she undergoes a complete rebirth—physically, mentally, and emotionally—she’ll never be a match for Nathan.” Having observed Nathan for years, Lucas knew better than to meddle. Even if it meant enduring his sister’s complaints, he refused to take on such a thankless, doomed endeavor.

Evelyn nearly laughed. I completely forgot—this man used to ship Nathan and Cassandra. Now, it seems he’s shifted his support… to us.

Amusement flickered in Nathan’s eyes. Perhaps he’s now an advocate for our relationship.

Seeing Lucas’s open-mindedness, Evelyn decided to confide in him, recounting the earlier incident in detail.

The revelation left Lucas silent for a long moment.

Compared to Ruby’s offense, this was far more serious.

When he finally spoke again, his voice was tightly controlled, simmering with suppressed anger. “So, Ruby was auditioning for the female lead role—without informing our family. And Oliver skipped our gathering to escort her there?”

Evelyn smirked, her tone laced with sarcasm. “You truly had no idea, did you? Well, here’s something else you should know…”

Recalling the scene she had witnessed, she leaned in slightly, her words dripping with mischief. “There’s something more between those two. I saw Oliver with his hand on her waist—and then sliding lower.”

Those cousins are already at odds, with Deborah caught in the middle. Now, Lucas’s sister is entangled with Oliver? Evelyn stifled a laugh. This is getting deliciously messy.

A thought struck her. Wait… does this count as sabotaging their engagement party?

Huh. Maybe fate has a twisted sense of humor after all.
###Chapter 268 Effortlessly Saying Sweet Nothings
Mind Games and Whispered Secrets

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers tightened around her coffee cup as she leaned against the kitchen counter, her gaze distant. The morning sunlight streamed through the windows, casting golden streaks across the marble surfaces, but her mind was far from serene.

"Oh, this is too good," she thought, biting back a smirk. The mental chatter around her had become an endless stream of scandalous revelations, each more tantalizing than the last.

Nathan Blackwood, ever the composed businessman, strode into the room, his tailored suit immaculate as always. He paused when he saw her expression—the slight curve of her lips, the mischievous glint in her eyes.

"What’s got you looking like the cat who got the cream?" he asked, pouring himself a cup of black coffee.

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Just enjoying the morning."

Nathan arched a brow. "You’re plotting something."

She laughed, light and airy. "Me? Never."

But inside, her mind was a whirlwind of secrets.

Victoria Hayes, his ever-loyal secretary, had been skimming funds from company accounts for months.
Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s own agent, was secretly negotiating a deal behind her back.
And Nathan’s first love, Cassandra, was back in town—with a child who bore an uncanny resemblance to him.

Oh, the drama.

Evelyn took a slow sip of her coffee, savoring the bitter warmth. She could practically feel the tension simmering beneath the polished surface of their lives.

Nathan studied her for a long moment before shaking his head. "You’re impossible."

She grinned. "You love it."

He exhaled, but the corner of his mouth twitched. "Against my better judgment."

The moment was interrupted by the sharp buzz of Evelyn’s phone. A message from Lillian Graves, her assistant, flashed across the screen:

"You need to see this. Now."

Attached was a grainy photo—Nathan, standing outside a luxury hotel, his arm wrapped around a familiar blonde.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

Cassandra.

Her fingers hovered over the screen, torn between fury and fascination.

Nathan frowned. "What is it?"

She locked the phone with a click, forcing a smile. "Nothing important."

But inside, her mind was already racing.

Game on.

Evelyn was certain it wasn’t her fault. She was merely an innocent gossip enthusiast, a passionate sharer of juicy tidbits who thrived on being the first to know.

Yet, the person on the receiving end of this particular revelation was utterly stunned.

Silence stretched on the other end of the line once more.

But anyone could sense the volcanic fury simmering beneath that quiet.

.

Lucas wasn’t the only one blindsided. Even Nathan was left speechless upon hearing the news. When Nathan had walked into the room earlier, there had been no obvious signs of impropriety between the two, so he hadn’t suspected a thing. He’d only found it odd that they were together at such an unusual hour.

Now, the truth hit him like a freight train, and disgust coiled in his gut.

"Lucas," Nathan cautioned, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. "Don’t do anything reckless."

When Lucas finally spoke, his voice was rough with suppressed rage. "Thanks for the heads-up. I’ll deal with them personally."

The call ended, and Evelyn mused aloud, "Lucas is furious. Honestly, who wouldn’t be? Finding out your own sister is being treated like a lover by your cousin—blood-related or not—it’s downright vile."

"There’s more to it than that," Nathan said.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Enlighten me."

She didn’t bother checking her system for details. Nathan was always more than happy to indulge her love of gossip.

"Caleb and Lucas have been rivals since childhood. They’ve never gotten along—no brotherly affection whatsoever. Mrs. Harrison always favored Lucas, even naming him her heir. So Caleb developed a habit of stealing things from Lucas just to destroy them later. It was his way of getting back at him," Nathan explained.

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "Wait… so you’re saying Beatrice might’ve been—"

Nathan shook his head. "He hid it too well. Caleb had no idea."

A realization dawned on Evelyn. Maybe Lucas’s flawless deception had been to protect Beatrice all along.

"So Caleb’s sleazy behavior wasn’t just about lust? He was trying to mess with Lucas by making Luna his lover? What a joke. How could she be so easily fooled? Didn’t she realize the man she was with despised her own brother?" Evelyn scoffed.

Nathan sighed. "Lucas grew up with the Winters family, raised by the elders. Luna, on the other hand, lived with the Willis family. Same mother, but they were never close. Lucas only paid attention to her because their mother demanded it. Truthfully, Luna never liked him much."

"She doesn’t like her own brother but falls for a playboy like Caleb? Ugh… Did she hit her head or something?" Evelyn rolled her eyes.

Nathan smirked. "Some people have questionable taste."

Evelyn huffed. "Questionable is an understatement."

The car rolled to a stop, and Nathan turned to her, his expression serious again. "This isn’t just about revenge or twisted games. Lucas won’t let this slide."

Evelyn nodded. "I know. And honestly? I wouldn’t want to be in Caleb’s shoes right now."

A dark chuckle escaped Nathan. "Neither would I."

The atmosphere in the car shifted subtly as Nathan's gaze darkened. "It's common for half-siblings to have complicated relationships," he remarked, his voice low. "The competition for parental affection and the refusal to acknowledge each other's fathers often creates tension. The bond between Vivian and Gwendolyn is an exception, not the rule."

Evelyn recalled how inseparable the sisters were—always inviting her out under the pretense of celebrity chasing. "It really does depend on the individuals involved," she mused.

Nathan continued, his fingers tightening imperceptibly on the steering wheel. "With a ten-year age gap, Lucas naturally felt protective of Luna, treating her more like a guardian than a brother. But Luna? She was arrogant, disrespectful. Every time they met, she lashed out at him, treating him like an enemy. So no, I don’t believe she was tricked into being with Caleb."

This time, Nathan didn’t need to spell it out—Evelyn had already pieced it together.

Damn. So they were in cahoots, two villains conspiring to ruin Lucas. Unbelievable. Still, Nathan had given her one possible motive for Luna’s hostility.

Nathan’s jaw clenched. It’s not that I don’t know. Lucas just never talks about it. And I won’t betray his trust by revealing what he’s kept hidden. Besides, he—

His breath hitched, his grip on the wheel turning white-knuckled. For a split second, his mind blanked. But Evelyn’s relentless internal monologue beside him quickly snapped him back to reality.

Just because Ava despised Lucas, Luna mimicked her, inheriting that same disdain for her older brother.

Nathan scoffed inwardly.

Ava was another piece of work. Lucas’s traumatic birth had nearly killed her, leaving her with lasting resentment. Then, after her husband’s death, a fortune-teller claimed Lucas was the family’s curse. That sealed her hatred—so much so that she turned abusive until Mdm. Lydia intervened. The Winters family took Lucas in, but Ava, terrified he’d "curse" her to death, remarried. Even then, Lucas endured years of emotional neglect.

Nathan’s lips twitched as Evelyn’s thoughts continued.

This woman blamed Lucas for everything, acting like he owed her for her suffering. She’d guilt-trip him into cleaning up the messes Luna and the Willis family made. Thank God Lucas had enough self-respect not to be manipulated—he just did what was necessary. His relationship with his mother? A never-ending power struggle. A toxic mother, a bratty sister, and now Luna, engaged to another man. Poor Lucas. Handsome, capable, and utterly tragic.

Evelyn nearly laughed at her own assessment.

By then, they’d reached the mall.

She was used to Nathan opening the car door for her.

But this time, he unbuckled his seatbelt, then hers—and without warning, pulled her into his arms right there in the car.

The sudden embrace caught Evelyn completely off guard.

Nathan's arms wrapped around her so tightly she could feel the rapid rise and fall of his chest against hers. It was as if he were clinging to her like a drowning man to a lifeline, his grip desperate yet tender.

Evelyn, usually oblivious to subtle cues, couldn’t ignore the intensity of the moment. "What’s wrong?" she asked, her voice muffled against his shoulder.

"I just needed to hold you," Nathan murmured, his deep voice vibrating through her, sending shivers down her spine. The confined space of the car amplified the intimacy, making her pulse race.

A whirlwind of emotions swept through her. Is he… flirting with me? She bit back a laugh. We sleep in each other’s arms every night. But they say when you like someone, your heart does funny things—skips beats, flutters, pulls you closer. Am I really that irresistible?

The thought must have shown on her face, because Nathan’s lips twitched into an amused smile.

"I want to hold you like this forever," he whispered, his breath warm against her ear. "Never letting go."

Evelyn’s cheeks burned. Wow. The famously cold, ruthless CEO has turned into a complete romantic. And here I am, melting like butter.

If anyone else had heard her inner monologue, they might have accused her of ruining the moment. But to Nathan, her unfiltered thoughts were endearing—so much so that the tips of his ears turned pink.

As always, Nathan didn’t demand a response. He never pressured her. His words were simply an overflow of emotion before they returned to their usual rhythm.

He released her, stepped out of the car, and opened her door with practiced grace. Hand in hand, they strolled through the boutique-lined streets, chatting and laughing as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

It wasn’t until they’d picked out gifts and settled into a cozy café that Evelyn finally circled back to the earlier drama.

He actually did it! She grinned into her latte. Lucas punched Caleb, but of course, he was sneaky about it—hitting where no one could see. Caleb actually whimpered in pain. Serves him right! I bet Lucas still had some pent-up resentment in that swing. But Luna—ugh! How could she side with Caleb and slap her own brother? Unbelievable!

###Chapter 269: Savoring Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched languidly, her mind already buzzing with the latest gossip she had overheard the night before.

Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Hayes? Really?

A smirk curled her lips as she replayed the whispered conversation between her assistant, Lillian Graves, and Preston Whitmore. The director had let slip something juicy about Nathan’s supposed late-night rendezvous with his secretary.

Evelyn rolled onto her side, propping her chin on her hand. Oh, this is too good.

She had always suspected there was something… unprofessional between Nathan and Victoria. The way the woman lingered a little too long in his office, the way her perfectly manicured fingers brushed against his arm whenever she handed him documents.

Pathetic.

But now? Now she had confirmation.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Serena Whitmore, her agent:

"Don’t forget—meeting with Donovan Sharpe at noon. He’s bringing the revised script."

Evelyn sighed. Business as usual. But her mind was already elsewhere.

How should I use this little tidbit?

She could confront Nathan directly, watch that arrogant mask of his crack. Or better yet—let it slip to the press. A scandal like this would send shockwaves through Blackwood Industries.

Her fingers tapped against the silk sheets, plotting.

Then another thought struck her.

What if… what if she played the gracious, understanding fiancée? Pretended she didn’t know a thing, let Nathan dig his own grave deeper?

Oh, the delicious irony.

A soft laugh escaped her as she imagined the look on Victoria’s face when she realized Evelyn had known all along.

Game on.

She reached for her phone, typing out a quick reply to Serena:

"Tell Donovan I’ll be there. And… I might have some interesting news to share."

With that, she tossed the phone aside and swung her legs out of bed.

Today was going to be fun.

Lucas stood frozen, his cheek stinging from Luna's slap. The coldness in her eyes sent a shiver down his spine. Despite her constant disdain, she was still his sister—his own flesh and blood. The stark contrast between how Vivian and Gwendolyn treated each other versus how Luna treated him made him let out a bitter laugh.

"Do you even hear yourself?" Lucas hissed. "He's days away from his engagement, and you're tangled up with a man who's already taken."

"Since when do you care?" Luna snapped, helping Caleb up from the ground while shooting Lucas a venomous glare. "Just because we share the same mother doesn’t mean you get to dictate my life."

Lucas inhaled sharply, his gaze shifting to Caleb. Even in pain, writhing on the ground, Caleb managed to smirk at him—mocking, triumphant.

Rage burned through Lucas. If this snake wasn’t his aunt’s son, he might have actually killed him.

"He’s using you to humiliate me, to get revenge. Do you really think he cares about you?"

Caleb didn’t bother denying it. He had promised Luna the glitz of Hollywood, flaunting her beauty to the world. He had stoked her resentment toward Lucas, turning her into his weapon. None of it was about love. If she truly mattered to him, how could he stand there and let her be his dirty little secret while he prepared to marry another woman?

Luna only laughed in Lucas’s face.

"I don’t care if he loves me or not," she taunted, her voice dripping with spite. "As long as I love him, that’s enough. I’ll happily be his mistress. And yes, I despise you. What are you going to do about it?"

The smugness in her expression—like she was savoring his anger—was infuriating. Her stubbornness was beyond reason.

Lucas had had enough. If reasoning wouldn’t work, he’d hit them where it hurt.

"Fine," he said coldly. "If you don’t end this, I’ll tell Mom about your little acting dreams—and exactly who’s funding them."

Then he turned to Caleb, his voice low and dangerous. "Aunt Adriana might turn a blind eye to your usual scandals, but Luna is still her former sister-in-law’s daughter. Do you really think she’ll let you play with her like this? Touch my sister again, and I’ll make sure Aunt Adriana knows everything."

The threat struck a nerve. The curses that followed were vicious, but Lucas didn’t flinch.

Without another word, he grabbed Luna’s arm and dragged her away.

"Take my warning seriously. Go ahead—test me if you dare!"

The words hung heavy in the air as Lucas ushered Luna into the car, driving straight back to the Reed residence without another word.

The moment they stepped inside, Luna clung to Penelope like a frightened child, sobbing about how Lucas had mistreated her.

Penelope didn’t bother asking for details. Her fury erupted instantly. "Unbelievable!" she seethed. "So you think just because you might inherit the Bennett family one day, you can treat us like dirt?"

"Mom," Lucas said, his voice steady but cold. "I disciplined Luna because she was out of line. If you keep coddling her, she’ll make a mistake that can’t be undone."

A mother should have sought the truth. But Penelope was too blinded by resentment to care. "If your sister made a mistake, it’s because of you," she spat. "You’ve been nothing but a curse on this family since the day you were born!"

Lucas had heard it all before. The words no longer stung—just left him numb. He knew reasoning with her was pointless. Without another word, he turned to leave.

"Keep an eye on Luna," he said over his shoulder. "She’s been running with the wrong crowd lately."

Luna immediately launched into a defensive tirade, and Penelope seemed ready to join her. But Lucas was already done listening.

As he reached the door, Penelope finally swallowed her rage enough to speak. "Wait. I have a question." Her voice was sharp. "Is Lydia planning to officially name you the heir at the engagement party? Will you start working under her then?"

Lucas paused. He could already see the gears turning in her mind—how she might use him to squeeze more benefits from the Bennett family.

"I don’t know," he said flatly. "And even if I did, it’s none of your concern. You left the Bennett family a long time ago."

Silence.

When Lucas glanced back, Penelope’s face was twisted into something dark, almost monstrous. Her glare was venomous, as if his very success was a personal insult.

His chest tightened. He understood now—she hated seeing him thrive. The better he did, the more it enraged her, as if his achievements came at the cost of the family’s downfall. He had never imagined superstition could poison someone so deeply.

But he was past caring.

Without another word, Lucas walked out.

Behind him, Luna seized the moment to stoke the flames. "Mom, did you see how he talked to you? He has no respect! And today, he hit me and Caleb. Who knows what he’ll do if he ever becomes head of the Bennett family?"

Penelope gasped. "He hit you?"

Luna knew exactly how to manipulate her. Penelope despised Lucas—always had. In fact, she treated Caleb, who wasn’t even her own blood, with more warmth than she’d ever shown her own son.

And Lucas? He was already gone, the door closing behind him with finality.

The tension in the air was palpable as Luna stormed into the mansion, her face flushed with anger. She didn’t even spare Lucas a glance—her disdain for him had reached new heights.

So, she wasn’t afraid to bring Caleb into the conversation.

Luna quickly spun a lie, her voice dripping with feigned innocence. "Today, I finally got a chance to spend some time with Caleb. Out of nowhere, Lucas showed up. You know how much he despises Caleb—he’s always been jealous of our closeness. He started mocking me, even went as far as attacking me. He’s cruel, Mother. And now? He’s lying to you, claiming I was with some shady people. He’s lost his mind!"

Penelope didn’t overanalyze it. To her, Lucas was simply becoming more rebellious, more defiant—as if he no longer saw her as his mother. The thought darkened her expression.

"Does he really think he can stand on his own? I will never let him inherit the Bennett family. If he thinks he can break free from me, he’s delusional."

A plan was already forming in her mind. Then, her focus shifted back to the supposed attack. Luna clutched her side dramatically, pretending to be in pain, which only fueled Penelope’s fury. She swore then and there that she’d find a way to break Lucas’s legs.

Once Luna retreated to her room, she immediately resumed her scheming with Caleb. Like rats plotting in the shadows, they spent their days devising ways to sabotage Lucas.

Meanwhile, Evelyn, who had been silently observing through her system, couldn’t help but sigh in frustration.

Lucas is going about this all wrong. Luna thrives on rebellion. After being humiliated by Nathan and scolded by her own brother, she’s even more determined to cling to Caleb—if only to spite Lucas. Would he really report them if they crossed the line again?

In truth, Nathan wanted to argue. He hadn’t insulted anyone.

But if those two got tangled up in their mess again, Lucas would report them.

What the hell? He’s gone to see Beatrice again. Could it be…?

Nathan was stunned. Had his brother finally decided to stop holding back?

But was it too late?

And knowing Beatrice, she wouldn’t cancel the engagement party over something like this.

###Chapter 270 Endure It

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her plush velvet sofa, a steaming cup of Earl Grey in hand, scrolling absently through her phone. But her mind wasn’t on the screen—it was tuned to the chaotic symphony of thoughts buzzing around her.

Ever since she’d discovered her uncanny ability to hear people’s innermost musings, life had become infinitely more… entertaining.

"Ugh, if Nathan Blackwood glares at me one more time today, I swear I’ll quit," grumbled Victoria Hayes, Evelyn’s ever-disgruntled secretary, from the next room. Evelyn smirked. Poor Victoria. If only she knew Nathan’s icy glares were just his way of hiding how utterly flustered Evelyn made him.

A ping from her phone interrupted her amusement. A message from Serena Whitmore, her agent:

"Emergency meeting at 11. Studio execs are panicking over Harrison Montgomery’s latest scandal. Bring popcorn."

Evelyn’s lips curled. Harrison Montgomery—Hollywood’s golden boy, Natalie Whitaker’s picture-perfect husband—was embroiled in yet another affair. This time with Vanessa Sterling, his co-star from "Midnight Whispers." The tabloids hadn’t caught wind yet, but the studio was in damage-control mode.

She took a sip of tea, savoring the drama. Then—

"I can’t believe Daniel’s cheating on me with Adriana. After everything I’ve done for him!"

The raw pain in Sophia Blackwood’s mental voice made Evelyn freeze. Sophia—Nathan’s sister, her soon-to-be sister-in-law—had just uncovered her husband’s infidelity. And Evelyn was the only one who knew.

Her phone buzzed again. Nathan this time.

"Dinner tonight. Wear the red dress."

A shiver ran down her spine. That dress was his favorite—the one that made his thoughts turn deliciously indecent. But now, with Sophia’s heartbreak hanging between them, could she really enjoy the evening?

Evelyn exhaled.

Looks like she had more than just Hollywood gossip to deal with today.

"Is the rumor actually true?"

Nathan was lost in thought when Evelyn's voice abruptly pulled him back to reality. Before he could even process her words, she had already seized his wrist, dragging him into motion.

They had planned to head to the underground garage after dinner, ready to retrieve their car and leave.

Instead, Evelyn yanked him behind a marble column, pressing a finger to her lips.

Then, the voices of a man and a woman drifted toward them.

At that moment, it clicked for Nathan. The Blackwoods and Holloways were supposed to have a private dinner gathering tonight—likely right here. After all, most of the city's elite restaurants were housed in this very mall, owned by Blackwood Enterprises.

Lucas Thornton shouldn’t have attended such a formal event, but he clearly knew the location. Timing-wise, by the time the gathering ended, Lucas was perfectly positioned to intercept someone.

What an absurd coincidence that they’d run into each other.

If there was a goddess of gossip, Evelyn was undoubtedly her favorite disciple.

Right now, she was practically vibrating with excitement, like a tabloid reporter who’d just stumbled upon a scandal involving A-list celebrities. She peeked out from behind a parked car, her head bobbing in and out of view like a mischievous child playing hide-and-seek.

Even the illustrious Nathan Blackwood had no choice but to crouch beside her. If the security team in the surveillance room saw their CEO engaged in such antics, they’d probably question their own sanity.

"What exactly is going on?" Beatrice Holloway asked, studying Lucas, who seemed to be struggling to find the right words.

This was, in fact, the first time the two of them had arranged to meet alone—an unfamiliar dynamic, despite having known each other for years. Soon, they would even be in-laws.

But Beatrice had serious doubts about whether they could ever get along. Their personalities were like oil and water.

She was the type who took time to warm up to people. Her friendships were always initiated by others, pulling her into their circles. She rarely made the first move.

Lucas, on the other hand, was naturally outgoing—yet he had never made an effort to engage with her. As a result, their relationship remained superficial, sustained only by circumstance and time.

He was warm and charming with everyone else, but with Beatrice? Cold. Distant. As if they were fundamentally incompatible.

So, when he had asked to meet her alone tonight, insisting he had something important to discuss, she had been genuinely stunned.

What could he possibly want to talk about?

The moment was tense, electric. Hidden behind a sleek black sedan some distance away, two figures held their breath, hearts pounding in their chests.

Is he really going to confess now? At this crucial moment? Evelyn Sinclair thought, her fingers tightening around the edge of the car door. Is it because he’s furious about what happened between Caleb and Luna? Is this about to turn into a full-blown scandal?

The more she considered it, the more exhilarated she felt. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood remained silent, though his sharp gaze never wavered from the scene unfolding before them. Even he wasn’t entirely sure what would happen next.

Then, Lucas Thornton finally spoke.

Evelyn’s excitement dimmed almost instantly, her shoulders slumping in disappointment. Nathan’s expression, on the other hand, smoothed into something unreadable—cool, detached.

Ugh. Not a confession after all.

Instead, Lucas had merely revealed the sordid affair between Caleb Moore and Luna Morgan.

“I’m sorry,” Lucas murmured, his voice rough with emotion. His gaze lingered on Beatrice Holloway, his expression a tangled mess of regret, frustration, and something else—something deeper.

Beatrice blinked, momentarily stunned. “He’s got nerve,” she said after a beat, shaking her head. “Messing around with other women is one thing, but to dare lay hands on his own cousin’s sister? He’s practically begging for a family war.”

“That’s the situation,” Lucas said quietly. “Whatever you decide to do, I’ll stand by you.”

Beatrice hesitated, then let out a dry laugh. “What do I want to do? Honestly, it’s not my problem. The Winters and the Willis families should be the ones panicking. It barely concerns me.”

Lucas froze. Then, to her surprise, he let out a low, humorless chuckle. It sounded almost self-deprecating. “Of course,” he muttered. “I should’ve known better than to think you’d fall apart over this.”

Beatrice frowned slightly at the look in his eyes—dark, intense, like he was holding back something unspoken. But she wasn’t in the mood to pry. With a careless shrug, she said, “Doesn’t matter if my future husband is a saint or a sinner. As long as my mother-in-law is decent, I can handle the rest.”

Lucas’s lips twitched into a faint, bitter smile. “Aunt Ava is a good woman,” he said softly. “She’ll treat you well.”

Beatrice nodded, her own smile polite but distant. “Thanks for telling me. If that’s all, I should get going.”

Being alone with Lucas always left her unsettled, like standing too close to an open flame.

He didn’t stop her.

As Evelyn and Nathan watched from the shadows, Lucas’s gaze followed Beatrice’s car until it disappeared around the corner. The moment she was gone, the air around him seemed to dim, his broad shoulders sagging slightly under an invisible weight.

Once they were back in their own car, Evelyn finally let out an exasperated huff. “Ugh! What a waste of my emotional investment!”

Nathan, however, didn’t seem surprised at all.

The Reckoning

Evelyn couldn't resist turning to Nathan, her voice laced with skepticism. "Do you think Lucas came here to warn Beatrice out of genuine concern—afraid she might be unaware of the viper lurking so close—or was he secretly hoping that once she learned the truth, she’d finally reject Caleb and call off their engagement?"

Nathan adjusted his grip on the reins, his expression unreadable. "Both. His primary motive was the former, but his deepest desire was the latter. He’s been in love with Beatrice for years. Of course, he’d want the alliance broken."

Evelyn’s eyes widened in shock. "You… you knew?"

A faint smirk played on Nathan’s lips as he glanced down at her from his horse. "I figured it out ages ago."

"You knew and didn’t tell me?" Evelyn huffed, crossing her arms. If she had only discovered this bombshell through the system, how had Nathan uncovered such a well-guarded secret and kept it to himself?

Ugh. I walked right into that one.

But Evelyn didn’t press further. Now that they were on the same page, it was time for some good old-fashioned gossip.

"If that’s the case, then Lucas is downright pathetic," Evelyn scoffed. "Too cowardly to fight for her himself, yet praying Beatrice would take the initiative? His unrequited love might seem tragic, but honestly, it’s just self-indulgent. He doesn’t deserve her."

Nathan understood Lucas’s dilemma—the weight of his debt to Lydia, the woman who had saved his life and shaped his future. But even he had to admit Lucas’s handling of the situation was… lacking.

"From his perspective," Nathan mused, "he already stole the inheritance meant for Lydia’s son. He couldn’t bring himself to take away the bride Lydia had carefully chosen for Caleb too. That’s why things ended up this way."

"But the Winters fortune was always meant for the most capable heir," Evelyn countered.

"And that’s where his guilt festers," Nathan said. "Without Lydia, he’d be dead. He believes every skill, every opportunity, even his right to inherit, was her doing. If she’d been selfish, ignored him as a child, everything would’ve gone to Caleb. And now, he’s convinced Caleb’s misery is his fault—that the constant comparisons between them ruined Caleb’s life."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. What a mess.

Of course, Beatrice was an outsider in this tangled web. She didn’t need to see things through the lens of a victim. Evelyn was just venting about Lucas’s spineless approach to love.

With emotions running high, the engagement party arrived.

Once again, the entire Blackwood family mobilized.

The Sinclairs never missed a chance to attend events with Evelyn.

The air was thick with anticipation—who knew what scandalous drama might unfold tonight?

It had to be said, the Blackwood family wasn’t the only one with a penchant for gossip. The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the venue, she could feel the weight of countless eyes boring into her, sharper and more invasive than usual.

Ugh.

She suppressed the urge to fidget. The whispers were nothing new—just the usual petty murmurs, harmless on their own. But beneath the polished smiles and polite nods, she could sense the undercurrents of judgment, the unspoken questions.

Like that one over there.

Her gaze flickered toward Lucas Thornton, standing beside a poised, regal woman as they greeted guests. His exhaustion was palpable—dark circles shadowed his eyes, his smile strained.

Tough it out, coward. Evelyn’s lips curled slightly. This was your choice.

The Blackwoods followed her line of sight, their expressions unreadable.

###Chapter 271 Secret Affair

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse floor as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. The silk sheets tangled around her legs, still warm from the imprint of Nathan Blackwood’s body beside her. She reached out, but the space was empty—only the faint scent of his cologne lingered.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, peeked in. "Victoria Hayes is here. She says it's urgent."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the sheets. Victoria—Nathan’s scheming secretary—was the last person she wanted to see this early. "Tell her I’ll be out in five."

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek black dress that screamed power rather than the vulnerability she felt. When she stepped into the living room, Victoria stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her crimson lips curled in a smirk.

"Good morning, Evelyn. Or should I say, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Evelyn ignored the jab. "What do you want?"

Victoria slid a manila envelope across the glass coffee table. "Nathan asked me to deliver this. He thought you’d appreciate seeing it before the press does."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked as she flipped it open. Inside were photos—Nathan, his arm draped around a stunning brunette at a high-end restaurant last night. The timestamp read 11:47 PM.

Her stomach twisted. He’d left their bed for this?

Victoria’s voice dripped with faux sympathy. "He mentioned you two had a fight. I suppose this is his way of coping."

Evelyn slammed the envelope shut. "Get out."

Victoria’s smirk widened as she sauntered toward the door. "Oh, and Evelyn? Don’t take it personally. Nathan’s always been… easily distracted."

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Preston Whitmore, her director friend:

"Saw the photos. Call me. There’s more you need to know."

Her fingers hovered over the screen. More? What else was Nathan hiding?

Then, another notification—this time from Nathan himself:

"We need to talk. Tonight. Don’t make plans."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Whatever game he was playing, she wouldn’t be a pawn. Not again.

She dialed Preston. "Tell me everything."

"That's Lydia," Nathan murmured, keeping his head slightly bowed as Evelyn clung to his arm. Only after Evelyn had gotten a clear look at the woman in question and learned her name did she allow herself to observe more freely. This had become Nathan's habit—introducing key figures to Evelyn whenever they crossed paths, ensuring she never missed out on any juicy gossip.

Lydia was a force to be reckoned with in the business world. During Richard's time, she had been a frequent collaborator. Now, thanks to Nathan's sharp acumen, Richard had retired early to enjoy his golden years, leaving Lydia to work with Nathan instead. Naturally, the two were well-acquainted.

Aside from Howard, who stood like a silent shadow, members of the Carney family were also present nearby. As business partners, they exchanged warm greetings the moment they met.

Lucas remained by Lydia's side, assisting with the guests, while Beatrice had already retreated out of sight, ensuring she wouldn't appear until the engagement ceremony officially began.

Logically, Caleb should have been here.

But everyone knew he was nothing but trouble, so no one bothered asking why he was absent.

Without any inside information, Evelyn could only sit back and watch the drama unfold.

Evelyn: This is almost comical. Anyone who didn’t know better would think Lucas is the groom today. Oh, for heaven’s sake—I think I might actually gag.

Though they engaged in polite small talk, the Blackwoods were secretly eavesdropping. Being around Evelyn always guaranteed some scandalous revelations.

What’s going on? Is he planning to cause a scene at such an important event? Is he late? Or is he not coming at all? Or… could there be something else?

Evelyn: Even after being threatened, Caleb and Luna still have the audacity to carry on their affair. It’s like they’re spitting in Lucas’s face. Is this deliberate defiance, or are they intentionally trying to humiliate Beatrice?

The moment this tidbit reached the Blackwoods, they were utterly revolted.

Richard cast a pitying glance at Lydia.

Margaret shot Lucas a sympathetic look.

Sophia tilted her head back, exhaled dramatically, and immediately pulled out her phone to update her siblings on the latest gossip.

Evelyn: Maybe I should find a way to expose them? Hmm… No. Beatrice knows the truth but is pretending ignorance. She just wants this engagement to go smoothly. Caleb might have been harsh, but he plans to handle it discreetly. I should stay out of it—no need to get tangled in this mess. Best to just survive the day in one piece.

Nathan Blackwood felt the same way. Given how events had unfolded, it was no longer appropriate for them to interfere.

As the Blackwood family entered the grand hall, they dispersed, each gravitating toward their own social circles. Wherever they settled, the whispered conversations inevitably turned to Caleb Moore's conspicuous absence, how pitiful Beatrice Holloway looked, and the strong possibility that the Blackwoods would officially announce Lucas Thornton as the heir today. This was precisely why so many relatives had gathered—to witness the shift in power firsthand.

Meanwhile, Marcus Prescott's group was deep in discussion about the very same matter.

"I suppose Lucas will be next in line after Mr. Nathan," Marcus remarked with a teasing smirk.

"From the looks of it, only those two are being considered for succession, huh?" Vivian Grant chimed in. "What about you, Vivian?"

Vivian Moore was also present that day.

"I’ve already started pushing my parents to have another child," she declared with a playful grin. "I trust in their abilities. There will be an heir. But like Beatrice, I’m focused on my career—and taking care of my younger sister, of course."

The others nearly burst out laughing at her audacity. When it came to unconventional solutions, Vivian was in a league of her own.

"Where’s Gwendolyn?" Evelyn Sinclair asked as soon as she sat down.

"She’s taking her exams," Vivian replied proudly. "My sister is far smarter than I ever was. She excels in everything academic."

"You can’t stop bragging about her these days, can you?" Daniel Wright chuckled.

Vivian immediately shot back, "I have a sister, and you don’t. Face it—you’re jealous!"

Daniel laughed. "It’s not me who’s jealous. It’s Lucas."

"Oh, please. Don’t even mention that ingrate," Vivian groaned.

"What happened?" Evelyn pressed, eyes sharp. Surely they didn’t know about that ungrateful wretch sneaking around in some dimly lit lounge, did they?

"Lucas’s half-sister just arrived," Vivian explained before Ines could. "He told her to stay close to their mother because of the crowd. She lost it and started mocking him in front of everyone!" She then mimicked Luna Morgan’s shrill tone: "Oh, so you think you’re already the head of the Blackwoods? Ordering me around before they’ve even announced you as heir?"

Vivian rolled her eyes dramatically.

Marcus scoffed. "Even if Lucas’s warning was unnecessary—she’s eighteen, not a child—he was just being a concerned older brother. Luna’s always been reckless and ungrateful. After all these years, she’s still the same rabid little brat."

In the past, whenever they crossed paths with Luna, she had never treated Lucas with anything resembling kindness. She was just as vicious now as she had always been.


The girl was often unreasonable and threw tantrums, which was why everyone disliked her.


Evelyn and Nathan exchanged a knowing glance. Lucas's warning to Luna had been crystal clear—he wanted her to stay away from Caleb.

Unfortunately, his words fell on deaf ears as the two continued their reckless behavior.

Lucas and Luna’s mother were equally at fault. She remained blissfully unaware of the brewing scandal, dismissing her son’s concerns and even enabling Luna’s sneaky disappearances. By now, Lucas probably didn’t have the energy to deal with them anymore.

The group chattered away, completely oblivious to the fact that Luna was embroiled in something far more disgraceful.

Nathan glanced around, and after pouring Evelyn a fresh cup of tea, he asked, "What are you searching for?"

"I was just curious about what your eccentric mother looks like."

Nathan pointed directly toward a woman in the crowd.

Evelyn’s gaze landed on a harsh, unsympathetic face among a cluster of gossiping women.

Evelyn: "Appearances really do reflect the heart. She looks like a villain straight out of a drama. Who knows how she’d react if she found out her precious daughter was entangled with a man of such notorious reputation. Knowing her, she’d probably blame Lucas for everything."

After a moment’s thought, Evelyn realized just how unfairly Lucas had been treated. He truly was the victim here.

Just as she was lost in her musings, the murmurs around them grew louder.

"Wow! I didn’t think he’d have the nerve to show up at his own engagement party," Marcus remarked.

"I bet he’s still immature and pulling stunts like this to get his mother’s attention," Daniel said bluntly.

"What is he, a child throwing a tantrum?" Vivian gasped in disbelief.

Vivian burst into laughter.

Evelyn and Nathan scanned the room but saw no sign of Luna. It seemed the two were determined to keep their affair hidden.

Then, Caleb appeared, promptly escorted by Lydia’s trusted aide to greet the guests at the main entrance.

About half an hour later, the engagement ceremony began.

Beatrice, draped in an elegant gown, made her entrance. With her flawless makeup, she looked absolutely stunning.

Vivian and Vivian cheered her on, snapping photos like devoted fans.

Evelyn couldn’t help but lean toward Nathan and whisper, "Caleb must be blind."


Nathan gave a slow, deliberate nod of approval.

At that precise moment, the man who was notoriously indifferent to his appearance stood beside Beatrice Holloway, looking unexpectedly polished. His tailored suit hugged his broad shoulders, and the dim lighting caught the sharp angles of his jawline—a stark contrast to his usual careless demeanor.

What made the scene even more intriguing was Lucas Thornton, the man who typically commanded every room with his presence, now relegated to the shadows at the edge of the stage. The spotlight didn’t touch him, leaving his expression unreadable. He stood motionless, his posture rigid, as if someone had carved the life out of him.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension, thick enough to slice with a knife.

Beatrice, oblivious—or perhaps deliberately ignoring it—smiled brightly at Nathan, her fingers brushing against his sleeve in a gesture that was far too intimate for a professional setting.

Lucas’s knuckles whitened where they gripped the edge of the stage.

No one dared to comment.

But everyone noticed.

###Chapter 272 Claim Of Ownership

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She exhaled sharply, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. The weight of the upcoming meeting pressed on her shoulders like an invisible burden.

Nathan Blackwood’s deep voice echoed in her mind—"You’re overthinking this, Evelyn. Just trust your instincts."

She scoffed, picking up her phone to reread the message from Preston Whitmore, the director of her next project.

Preston: "We need to discuss the final revisions. The studio wants changes—especially for the third act."

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen. Changes. Again. She had fought for this script, poured her soul into it, and now they wanted to alter the heart of the story.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Come in," she called, setting her phone aside.

Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, stepped inside, balancing a tray with a steaming cup of coffee and a stack of documents. "Morning, Evelyn. You look like you’ve been wrestling with your thoughts all night."

Evelyn accepted the coffee with a grateful sigh. "More like wrestling with studio executives in my dreams."

Lillian smirked. "Well, brace yourself. Marcus Donovan just called. He’s on his way up."

Evelyn’s brows shot up. "Julian’s agent? Why?"

Before Lillian could answer, the elevator dinged, and Marcus strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable.

"Evelyn," he greeted smoothly. "We have a situation."

She crossed her arms. "What kind of situation?"

Marcus handed her a tablet. On the screen was a tabloid headline:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Vanessa Sterling—Is Evelyn Sinclair Out of the Picture?"

Evelyn’s stomach twisted, but she schooled her features into indifference. "And?"

Marcus’s gaze sharpened. "And Julian thinks this could affect investor confidence in your joint project. The last thing we need is bad press derailing everything."

Evelyn set the tablet down with deliberate calm. "Tell Julian not to worry. My personal life won’t interfere with my work."

Marcus studied her for a beat before nodding. "Good. Because the studio’s already skittish. One wrong move, and they might pull the plug."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathan:

"We need to talk."

Her fingers tightened around the device.

Lillian cleared her throat. "Should I reschedule your meeting with Preston?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No. Let’s handle one fire at a time."

But as she glanced back at the tabloid photo—Nathan’s arm draped casually around Vanessa’s waist—a quiet storm brewed inside her.

Trust your instincts, he had said.

But right now, she wasn’t sure she trusted him.

"Tsk, tsk. Poor thing," Evelyn murmured under her breath, her fingers tightening around her champagne flute.

The others nearby had no idea she was actually referring to Lucas.

"Right?" Vivian chimed in, tossing her sleek auburn hair over one shoulder. "I feel sorry that Beatrice is doomed to marry such a man. Honestly, I’d love to crash their engagement party." A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes. "Maybe I should hire a few gorgeous models to sweep Beatrice off her feet—save her from that walking disaster."

Nathan scoffed, swirling his drink. "Beatrice wouldn’t give you the time of day."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "She told me she and Caleb are just a business arrangement. They’re even planning to use a surrogate for kids."

"You’re not wrong. Beatrice has… particular standards," Marcus added dryly.

This was news to Evelyn, and a weight she hadn’t realized she was carrying lifted slightly. At least now she knew Beatrice wasn’t some innocent girl ruined by a snake.

Still, watching the two exchange rings and fake smiles was nauseating.

Then Caleb took the microphone, his voice dripping with rehearsed charm.

"I’m beyond thrilled to be engaged to Beatrice. This is the first step toward our lifelong happiness together."

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. Since when did he become such a smooth talker? I expected him to embarrass himself in front of everyone.

Caleb turned to Beatrice, his gaze unnervingly intense. "Beatrice, from this moment on, you are officially mine."

The possessive edge in his voice made Beatrice stiffen. This wasn’t part of their agreement—their relationship was supposed to be strictly professional. But she played along, forcing a smile as he pulled her into a stiff embrace.

Evelyn’s grip on her glass turned white-knuckled.

Then, without warning, Nathan turned to Vivian. "Vivian, lend me your sunglasses."

Vivian’s oversized shades were practically a part of her face today, a bold fashion statement she hadn’t removed indoors. She blinked at Nathan’s sudden request but handed them over without question.

In one swift motion, Nathan slid them onto Evelyn’s face, shielding her from the sickening display in front of them.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Good. I don’t have to watch this farce anymore.

"There are reporters here," Nathan murmured, his displeasure evident.

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

It wasn’t that she feared being photographed. At past events, credentialed reporters had always been present, discreet and professional. But today, she hadn’t spotted a single one, leading her to assume the Blackwoods didn’t engage with the media in such settings.

Unauthorized photos, however, were a different beast—ripe for manipulation, for twisting narratives. Isabelle Laurent had warned her: If you sense paparazzi, cover your face. It makes damage control easier.

Yet Evelyn hadn’t noticed a thing. Nathan, though not an artist, had sharper instincts.

"Where?" she asked, keeping her sunglasses firmly in place.

"What? Paparazzi? Since when does the Blackwood family allow this? No one warned us!"

Their small group stiffened in alarm.

Nathan’s frown deepened. "Lucas didn’t arrange this. It’s Caleb. His business partners’ table—they’re filming covertly."

Eyes flicked toward the indicated group. Sure enough, several guests cradled devices in their arms, lenses subtly angled, capturing footage without permission.

"What’s Caleb playing at? Why the secrecy?" Marcus Prescott muttered, baffled.

Nathan didn’t answer. Instead, he pulled out his phone and dialed Lucas, relaying the situation in clipped tones.

The ceremony had ended, the toast concluded. The moment Lucas received the message, he sought out Ava.

Within minutes, Ava summoned Caleb for an explanation.

"What’s the issue? Can’t I document my own engagement?" Caleb’s tone was defensive, bordering on petulant. "You might dismiss my company, but I’ve poured everything into it, Mother."

Ava exhaled, rubbing her temples. It was always like this—she could guide empires, yet her own son remained an enigma wrapped in rebellion.

"Tattling to my mother again? Pathetic," Caleb sneered at Lucas, who ignored him, long accustomed to empty threats.

"Enough," Ava cut in, weariness lacing her voice. "Today is important. If you insist on filming, one rule: no footage of the guests."

Caleb shrugged, as if it were obvious. "Wasn’t planning to."

Seeing his unexpected compliance, Evelyn let out a quiet sigh of relief. Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, she gestured for Nathan to step away first, signaling she needed a private word with Caleb.

But Caleb’s expression was already darkening with impatience. "What?"

Evelyn had intended to soften her tone, but his sharp response made her hesitate. "I know you and Nathan have always clashed, and I understand why you feel the way you do," she began carefully. "But you must remember—we’re family. I could never favor him over you. The only reason I’ve invested more in him is because he has the skills to carry the Blackwood legacy."

She believed herself to be fair, even logical, yet Caleb’s face twisted further. "So, in your eyes, I’ll never measure up to him, is that it?"

Evelyn didn’t understand his resentment. She had built an empire while her husband remained content in the background, never once complaining. Everyone had their strengths—why must they compete? Their marriage had thrived on balance, yet their son seemed determined to wage war.

"You have your own talents," she said gently, not wanting to escalate tensions, especially not today. "Once Nathan takes over, you’ll have the freedom to pursue whatever you want. That’s not a bad compromise, is it?"

Caleb’s control snapped. "So, it’s official then? They’re announcing him as the heir today, and you’re here to soften the blow for me first?"

"This was a decision made by the entire family council."

Caleb refused to accept it. In his mind, if Evelyn had just supported him instead of Nathan, the title would have been his. Ability didn’t matter—he deserved it. It was Nathan’s existence that held him back, and the world’s refusal to see his worth.

Fine. If they won’t give me what’s mine, I’ll drag them all down with me.

He smirked, cold and bitter. "Nathan might not be the golden boy you think he is. Just don’t come crying to me when you regret choosing him."

Without another word, he turned and walked away.

Meanwhile, Nathan had already circled back to Lucas. He knew the man well enough to guess his concern—his celebrity wife. Quickly, he reassured him that no photos of the guests would be taken.

Yet Lucas still didn’t let Evelyn remove her sunglasses.

"What’s his game?" Vivian muttered. "Using his own engagement party as free publicity for his company? Is he really that desperate?"

"If they’re not photographing guests, why all the secrecy?" Marcus questioned, frowning.

"Something’s not right," Vivian agreed, her instincts prickling.

After a brief pause, Daniel turned to Nathan with a thoughtful expression. "Do you think they got caught in the act and panicked, making up some ridiculous excuse on the spot? Though I doubt they'll be bold enough to try anything like this again."

Evelyn studied Nathan's face intently, her curiosity piqued.

The man's brows knitted together in suspicion. "It's not that straightforward. He's invested too much time and effort into setting this up—there must be something more behind it."

Given the circumstances, further investigation was necessary.

Evelyn's mind raced. Not only is Caleb carrying on his affair at his own engagement party, but he's also scheming something else? Let me think... He invited those reporters primarily to... Wait—to expose his own infidelity?!

###Chapter 273 My Mind Is Spinning Out of Control
Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her latte, scrolling through her phone absentmindedly—until a familiar voice cut through her thoughts.

"Oh my god, did you hear about Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Hayes?"

Evelyn’s fingers froze mid-scroll. That voice—sharp, gossipy—belonged to Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant. But Lillian wasn’t speaking aloud. No, this was… internal.

A slow smirk curled Evelyn’s lips. Since when could I hear people’s thoughts?

She focused, tuning into the mental chatter like adjusting a radio frequency.

"Rumor has it Victoria’s been sneaking into Nathan’s office after hours. And not for paperwork." Lillian’s mental voice dripped with scandalized delight. "But here’s the juicy part—she’s also been leaking company secrets to Preston Whitmore. Double betrayal!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee. Victoria, Nathan’s secretary—a spy?

Before she could process it, another thought-wave hit her—this one from Marcus Donovan, Julian Blackwood’s agent, pacing outside her building. "If Julian finds out Nathan’s been embezzling funds, the Blackwood empire will implode. Time to cash in my stocks."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Embezzlement? This wasn’t just gossip—it was a landmine.

Then, like a soap opera crescendo, Nathan’s own thoughts sliced through the noise as he entered the lobby below. "Evelyn can never discover the truth about Sophia’s accident. Or that I paid off the witnesses."

The latte cup slipped from Evelyn’s grip, shattering on the floor.

Lucas had been informed that Penelope wanted to speak with him. Already in a foul mood that day, the last thing he wanted was another tense confrontation with her. Experience had taught him that nothing good ever came from her seeking him out.

Yet Luna had come to urge him repeatedly, leaving him no choice but to comply.

Meanwhile, Penelope had excused herself from the banquet and retreated to a private lounge. When Lucas arrived, she gestured for him to sit.

"What do you want?" he asked bluntly.

The moment she saw him, a surge of irritation flared within her, but she suppressed it with practiced ease. Instead, she casually steered the conversation toward his future.

Her sudden concern about when he would settle down only deepened his confusion.

"I heard you'll soon be announced as the Bennett family heir," she remarked, her tone deceptively light. "I don’t have much to offer in terms of blessings, but I hope you’ll never forget where you came from."

With that, she raised her glass in a mock toast.

Lucas knew better than to expect anything pleasant from her. A simple blessing was the most he could hope for in their strained relationship. Without hesitation, he grabbed the nearest wine bottle, poured himself a glass, clinked it against hers, and downed it in one swift motion.

A flicker of triumph—and something darker—flashed in Penelope’s eyes. "In the future, do look after Luna and her child’s interests. You owe Caleb that much. You should be grateful and repay him accordingly."

Lucas exhaled sharply. Here we go again. He had already endured watching the woman he loved become Caleb’s fiancée. What more did she want from him? Gratitude? Stubbornness? Since when did others—especially his own mother—get to dictate how he should feel?

Finally, his restraint snapped. "Are you even my real mother?"

Penelope’s eyes widened briefly before she scoffed. "What kind of ridiculous question is that?"

"Funny," he shot back. "You ask me to take care of Luna, but then demand I repay Caleb? Have you forgotten the Bennett family rules? There’s no tradition where the heir owes anything to those who failed to claim the position. I earned this with my own skills—not because he let me have it. We both trained under Aunt Eleanor, and she chose me because I outperformed him. The only person I owe gratitude to is her. Caleb has nothing to do with this."

The words poured out of him, a flood of pent-up frustration finally unleashed.

Truthfully, Lucas had never craved the role of heir. But from childhood, he had been conditioned to believe that his place in this family was tied to his worth. And now, bound by duty and expectation, he had no choice but to accept it.

The Blackwoods never once believed that Lucas had stolen Caleb's future. He had often reflected on why such toxic thoughts plagued him—thoughts so deeply rooted they seemed impossible to uproot. Deep down, he knew the answer: Penelope's relentless manipulation.

The cruelest part of family ties was how they bound you to things you knew were wrong, yet couldn’t escape.

Even though logic screamed he owed no one, guilt still whispered that he should surrender. I already gave up the woman I loved. What more do they want from me?

Penelope’s suffocating expectations pressed down on him like a vise.

Then, suddenly, his vision blurred. Heat surged through his veins, his breaths turning shallow. His limbs grew heavy, his thoughts sluggish.

Lucas’s gaze snapped to Penelope, realization dawning. "You drugged me?" His voice was hoarse. "What the hell are you planning?"

Penelope’s face twisted into something ugly.

"Ungrateful wretch!" she spat. "You think someone like you deserves to lead this family? You’ve failed me—failed your father! You should be groveling for forgiveness!"

Her words dripped with venom, her eyes wild. Only when Lucas collapsed did she finally exhale, her expression smoothing into cold satisfaction. With a sharp gesture, she summoned Luna.

The younger woman hurried in, barely containing her excitement. "It worked that fast?"

"What about next door?" Penelope demanded.

"That woman already drank what Caleb gave her. I checked—she’s completely unconscious." Luna hesitated. "But… what if they accuse us when they wake up?"

Penelope scoffed. "The Blackwoods won’t make a scene. As for the Holloways, they’ll take any marriage alliance they can get. They won’t care who it’s with."

Luna’s laughter bubbled up. "Then Caleb will be the heir!"

Penelope nodded, her smile almost affectionate.

Luna’s mind raced. If Caleb takes over, I’ll be the future Mrs. Blackwood. Forget the Reeds—this is power. Nathan might be out of reach, but I’ll make Evelyn Sinclair regret crossing me.

A flicker of doubt crossed her face. Caleb wasn’t easy to control. But she had a plan.

That photo of us together earlier? Perfect leverage. Once the family announces Caleb’s engagement is off and he’s named heir, I’ll reveal our relationship. If he resists, I’ll leak the photo. They’ll force him to marry me.

Her lips curled. Of course, I can’t let Mother know. She acts like she cares about Caleb, but it’s all for Nathan’s sake. She despises him—just like she despised his mother. Their feud must’ve been brutal. Maybe she thinks her ex-husband would’ve been head of the family if not for Eleanor.

The thought gave her pause.

Then why is she helping Caleb now?

Something didn’t add up.

And that unsettled her.

It made perfect sense now why her mother had chosen to help Oliver instead of Lucas. After all, compared to Mrs. Holloway, her mother must have despised Lucas Thornton even more—the man who had brought nothing but chaos into their lives. The thought didn’t unsettle Luna; if anything, a twisted satisfaction curled inside her.

With calculated movements, she hauled Lucas—now unconscious—into the adjacent room, dumping him unceremoniously onto the bed where Beatrice Holloway lay. The impact drew a faint groan from Beatrice, though she remained blissfully unaware. Lucas, however, stirred as the heat radiating from his body intensified, his senses slowly clawing back to awareness.

The intoxicating scent beneath him, the warmth and softness pressing against his skin—it all chipped away at his restraint. The sharp click of the door closing finally forced his heavy eyelids open.

And then—his heart stopped.

The woman before him was the one he had longed for over a decade.

Back in the ballroom, the Blackwoods, thoroughly entertained by the unfolding drama, suddenly stiffened in realization.

Nathan: Who exactly are we catching in the act?

Oh god… How am I supposed to react? Caleb is about to walk in on Lucas and Beatrice?! Luna’s thoughts spiraled. You’re just handing your fiancée over like some twisted gift, aren’t you? A perfect strike right to Lucas’s weak spot!

A hysterical laugh bubbled up inside her. Wait—would Lucas have even needed persuasion if you’d just asked him outright? Would he have jumped at the chance to take your place in the marriage agreement?

No, no, I’m thinking about this all wrong. Her stomach twisted. They’ve been drugged. Locked in there together. Something terrible is going to happen—we have to stop this now!

###Chapter 274 On Their Way To Catch Them

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her coffee, scrolling through her phone. A smirk tugged at her lips—another scandal had erupted overnight in the entertainment world.

"Oh, this is delicious," she mused, her fingers pausing over a particularly juicy headline.

"Seraphina Delacroix Caught in Love Triangle—Sebastian Hart Spotted Leaving Her Hotel at Dawn!"

Evelyn’s laughter bubbled up. "And here I thought last week’s drama was peak entertainment."

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, breezed in with a tablet. "You’re in a good mood," she noted, eyeing Evelyn’s amused expression.

"Wouldn’t you be if you saw this?" Evelyn turned the screen toward her.

Lillian’s eyes widened. "Wait—Sebastian Hart? Isn’t he dating Isabelle Laurent now?"

"Was dating," Evelyn corrected, tapping the article. "Apparently, Seraphina couldn’t resist revisiting old flames. And Adrian Cross? Oh, he’s furious."

Lillian shook her head. "This industry never disappoints."

Evelyn leaned back, savoring the chaos. "The best part? This isn’t even the biggest secret I’ve heard today."

Lillian arched a brow. "Do I want to know?"

Evelyn’s grin turned sly. "Let’s just say… someone very high-profile is about to have their private messages leaked. And it’s going to ruin more than just a relationship."

Meanwhile, across town, Nathan Blackwood scowled at his phone.

Breaking: Harrison Montgomery’s Affair Exposed—Vanessa Sterling Speaks Out!

His jaw clenched. "Damn it."

His brother, Julian, glanced over. "Problem?"

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Harrison’s idiocy is about to blow back on us. His wife is Natalie Whitaker—Senator Whitaker’s daughter."

Julian whistled. "That’s not just a scandal. That’s a political nightmare."

Nathan’s phone buzzed—a message from Marcus Donovan.

Marcus: "We need to talk. Now."

Nathan’s stomach dropped. This was worse than he thought.

Back at Evelyn’s penthouse, her phone lit up with an encrypted notification.

Unknown: "You’ll want to see this before it goes public."

Attached was a video—one that made Evelyn’s breath hitch.

"Oh… this changes everything."

Her fingers flew across the screen.

Evelyn: "Who else has this?"

The reply was instant.

Unknown: "Just you. For now."

Evelyn’s pulse raced. This wasn’t just gossip.

This was leverage.

And she knew exactly how to use it.

Evelyn's inner monologue left the Blackwoods utterly stunned.

What? Caleb is setting a trap to frame his fiancée and Lucas?

They couldn't fathom why Caleb would orchestrate such a scheme. Had his disdain for Lucas grown so intense that he'd use his own fiancée as a pawn?

Yet, this confirmed one thing—Caleb had no idea Lucas harbored feelings for Beatrice. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have planned it this way.

Nathan’s expression darkened as he pieced together the deeper implications of their scheme.

"That’s odd. Beatrice just texted saying she’d be here soon. Why is she taking so long to change?" Vivian kept glancing at her phone, eager to gossip with Beatrice about Caleb’s underhanded move.

After all, Beatrice despised media attention.

The others were also waiting for Lucas, but there was still no sign of him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was frantic. Time was slipping away, and she couldn’t think of a plausible excuse. Grabbing Nathan’s arm, she blurted, "I feel a bit lightheaded. Come with me to rest for a moment."

Just then, Nathan’s phone lit up.

His eyes flicked to the screen as he played along with Evelyn—then his pupils constricted. He answered immediately.

"Help…"

A weak voice came through, but before the plea could finish, the call cut off abruptly.

Seeing the couple rush toward the east wing, the Blackwoods tensed but exhaled in relief. The three of them huddled in a corner, deciding to stay put—they might be needed later.

They assumed the crowd was gathering to catch Lucas and Beatrice in a compromising position, so they needed to keep an eye on Caleb and those reporters.

Their gazes flicked to Penelope in the distance, chatting and laughing with others, Luna by her side.

What kind of mother is she? they thought bitterly. Lucas deserves better.

Hurry, the break room in the east corridor—third one… third one… We need a reason to barge in.

Evelyn’s thoughts raced frantically.

Then Nathan’s voice cut through her panic.

"Evelyn, something’s wrong. Lucas and Beatrice—they’re in—"

Evelyn was still desperately searching for an excuse to enter that room when she heard the muffled groan. Instantly, her heart leaped with relief.

Wow, he actually resisted? I was certain Mrs. Hillis slipped Lucas something strong. How did he hold on and even call for help?

Lost in thought, she reached the third break room.

To her surprise, the door wasn’t locked—likely left that way to make catching them in the act easier. With a quick twist of the handle, it swung open.

A pained growl echoed from inside.

Evelyn and Nathan exchanged a glance before rushing in.

The sight that greeted them made them exhale in relief. Beatrice lay on the bed, unharmed except for slightly rumpled clothes.

Lucas, however, was curled on the floor, clutching a broken vase shard. Blood dripped from his palm where the sharp edges had cut deep. He was using pain to fight the drug’s effects, clinging to his last shreds of control.

The gruesome sight made Evelyn’s respect for him rise.

He’s resisting even now? Pathetic, but impressive.

Nathan hauled Lucas up and dragged him to the bathroom, dousing him with cold water to shock his system back to clarity.

Meanwhile, Evelyn tried shaking Beatrice awake, but the woman remained dazed, her consciousness too clouded to respond.

"Nathan, what now? Call the police? Or an ambulance?" Evelyn asked urgently.

Before Nathan could answer, Lucas—now slightly more coherent—gritted out, "No. Too obvious. It’ll look like we’re guilty even if we’re not. We can’t give them what they want."

Seeing the agony twisting Lucas’ face, Nathan nodded. "I’ll arrange a private doctor. But we need to move—now."

Evelyn’s inner voice screamed in alarm.

Oh no. They’re coming to catch us. What do we do?

Outside, the heir announcement should have begun by now. Lydia had waited endlessly for Lucas, growing more impatient by the minute. Calls to him went unanswered.

Frowning, she sent someone to search for him.

Then Caleb approached the Winters family table, where Lydia sat. "Where’s Beatrice? I can’t find her, and she’s not answering. I wanted to introduce her to my friends."

The Winters exchanged confused glances—none had seen Beatrice in a while.

The trap was closing in.

The soft murmur of a feminine voice suddenly cut through the hum of conversation. "I think I just saw Lucas following Beatrice to the break room. They must be discussing something private. But they've been in there for quite a while now."

The speaker was none other than Luna Morgan, her words dripping with feigned innocence. The moment they left her lips, whispers erupted among the guests.

What could Lucas Thornton possibly have to discuss alone with his future sister-in-law?

Beside her, Penelope Collins tugged at Luna’s sleeve urgently. "What nonsense are you saying? Lucas isn’t even close with her!"

But her defensive tone only fanned the flames of speculation.

Caleb Moore’s expression darkened instantly. Without hesitation, he turned on his heel and strode away.

The moment he moved, the entertainment reporters—disguised as guests—sprang to their feet, their excitement barely contained.

Vivian Moore’s face paled as she sensed trouble brewing. She quickly stepped forward, blocking Caleb’s path. "Beatrice is resting upstairs. Oh, and Caleb, I assigned Lucas some tasks earlier. He probably hasn’t  yet. Maybe you could go help him?"

She wasn’t entirely sure what was happening, but she wasn’t a fool. Something was clearly wrong, and making a scene would only make it worse.

Yet when Caleb shrugged her off without a word, she knew—this was about him. Her stomach twisted with dread.

By then, Caleb was already leading a small crowd down the corridor, his strides sharp with purpose.

The onlookers, oblivious to the truth, exchanged knowing glances.

"What’s going on? More drama?"

"Of course! Evelyn is here today!"

"Should we follow and see?"

"Judging by the looks of it, they’re about to catch someone red-handed!"

Some trailed after the group, while others whispered excitedly. Evelyn Sinclair’s presence had a way of igniting the room’s appetite for scandal. Normally, they might have stayed out of it—but today, they wanted front-row seats.

A small group near the back exchanged alarmed looks. They could only catch fragments of the gossip—something about Lucas and Beatrice being caught in a compromising situation.

"Is Caleb out of his mind? What could possibly be happening between those two?" Vivian Moore muttered in disbelief.

"Something’s off. This feels like a setup." Daniel Wright stood abruptly, realization dawning. "Nathan and Evelyn…"

"They said they were going to rest. Do you think there’s actually something scandalous going on?" Marcus Prescott asked, his voice low.

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.

The revelation left them stunned.

Vivian gasped, her hand flying to cover her parted lips.

Daniel, however, felt an odd sense of relief wash over him. If they're involved, this situation can't be as bad as it seems.

The thought made him scoff at himself. Since when had he started believing in such things?

Still, worry gnawed at them. The idea of Beatrice and Lucas being in a secret relationship was absurd—unless they'd been set up. And with Caleb's suspicious decision to invite reporters...

They exchanged a glance. No time to waste.

Without another word, they rushed after the others, determination fueling their steps.

The game was on.

###Chapter 275 Stop Being Nosy
Delicious Secrets Unraveled
The morning sun streamed through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows, casting golden streaks across her marble countertops. She sipped her lavender-infused latte, scrolling through her phone with idle curiosity—until a particular headline made her nearly choke on her drink.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Luxury Hotel with Mystery Woman at 3 AM!"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. The grainy paparazzi photo showed Nathan—his signature brooding expression in place—holding the door open for a statuesque brunette. The caption speculated wildly: Is the billionaire playboy finally moving on from his rumored entanglement with rising star Evelyn Sinclair?

A scoff escaped her lips. As if.

She knew Nathan better than the tabloids ever could. That "mystery woman" was none other than his cousin, Genevieve, visiting from Switzerland. But the media loved twisting narratives, and Evelyn had learned long ago not to take gossip at face value.

Still... curiosity gnawed at her.

Tapping her manicured nails against her phone case, she opened her messages and fired off a text to Lillian Graves, her ever-reliable assistant:

"Any intel on Nathan’s ‘scandalous’ hotel rendezvous? The press is having a field day."

Lillian’s reply was instantaneous: "Already on it. Give me 10 mins."

Evelyn smirked. Lillian was a wizard at digging up the truth—often before the parties involved even realized there was a story.

Setting her phone aside, Evelyn wandered to her floor-to-ceiling windows, overlooking the city skyline. Her reflection stared back—flawless makeup, sleek blonde hair, a designer silk robe draped over her shoulders. The perfect image of unbothered elegance.

But beneath the surface?

Her mind raced.

What if this wasn’t just tabloid nonsense? What if Nathan was seeing someone new? The thought sent an unexpected pang through her chest—one she quickly shoved aside. They weren’t together. They’d never been together, no matter how much the media—or her traitorous heart—wished otherwise.

Her phone buzzed. Lillian’s follow-up:

"Confirmed: It’s Genevieve. They were at a family meeting with Julian and Sophia. Boring stuff—estate planning, blah blah. The ‘hotel’ was the Blackwood corporate suite. Press just loves drama."

Evelyn exhaled, tension seeping from her shoulders. Of course.

But then—another message:

"Though... you might want to check Page Six’s latest. Someone’s feeding them very specific rumors about you and Preston Whitmore."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

Preston? The director she’d had one professional dinner with?

She swiped to the tabloid—and there it was:

"Evelyn Sinclair’s Secret Romance with A-List Director Heats Up!"

The attached photo showed them laughing over wine at a dimly lit restaurant. Innocent enough—but the caption painted it as a "clandestine lovers' meeting."

Evelyn groaned.

This wasn’t just gossip.

This was a setup.

And she had a sneaking suspicion she knew exactly who’d orchestrated it...

Nathan's expression darkened the moment he caught Evelyn's thoughts about the approaching crowd coming to catch Lucas and Beatrice together.

"Evelyn," he commanded sharply, "check the door—discreetly."

Without hesitation, Evelyn darted to the entrance and cracked it open just enough to peek outside. A quick scan confirmed her fears. She snapped the door shut.

"Damn it," she hissed. "There's a whole mob heading this way. If we step out now, we're screwed."

Inside the bathroom, Lucas had heard every word. His face drained of color, a mix of fury and helplessness twisting his features.

"Why... Why is this happening?" His mind raced through the betrayals—his mother, his sister, his own family. It was enough to make his blood boil.

"Save the self-pity for later," Nathan snapped.

He knew Lucas was fighting to stay composed, but the drugs in his system made rational thought nearly impossible. If not for his iron will, Lucas would have already lost control.

Seeing him struggle, Nathan took charge.

The bathtub was now filled, water lapping at Lucas's tense body. Nathan turned off the tap and tossed him a towel.

"Bite down on this if you have to," he ordered. "Just keep quiet. The last thing we need is them knowing you're here."

Nathan's voice carried an authority that even Lucas, in his haze, couldn't ignore. He obeyed, gripping the towel between his teeth.

When Nathan stepped out, Evelyn was desperately shaking Beatrice, trying to rouse her. After a quick assessment, he said, "Hide her in the closet. We'll make it look like we're the only ones here."

Evelyn's eyes lit up with realization.

Damn, no wonder he's the boss. If the intruders found just the two of them—a married couple—they’d be too embarrassed to search further. And if they dared, Nathan’s infamous icy glare would send them running.

Nathan barely suppressed an eye roll at her train of thought.

Evelyn hauled Beatrice up and stuffed her into the nearest wardrobe. By the time she turned back, Nathan was already straightening the room. The broken vase and the blood Lucas had smeared on the floor? She shoved them out of sight just in time.

Outside, Caleb stormed down the hallway, his expression thunderous.

Then, three members of the Blackwood family intercepted him. Oddly, they didn’t seem to notice the crowd trailing behind him.

"Perfect timing. You must be Caleb, right? Have you seen our son and daughter-in-law? We've been searching everywhere for them, but their phones seem to be off. There's something urgent we need to discuss!" Richard exclaimed, his voice laced with urgency.

Margaret chimed in, wringing her hands. "I'm terribly worried. Could you perhaps use the loudspeaker to make an announcement?"

Sophia Blackwood, ever the quick thinker, added, "Maybe you could check the surveillance footage for us?"

Caleb Moore was in a rush—his blood boiled at the thought of catching the cheaters in the act. But to his frustration, these three oblivious individuals blocked his path. His temper flared, yet he dared not lash out. Their status wasn't something he could dismiss lightly, so he swallowed his rage, cursing them silently instead.

"Go bother my mother if you need help."

"The Blackwood family won’t let that traitor slip away so easily. Whatever Nathan and Evelyn are doing, they need more time."

Seizing the moment, Lydia Winters—her face tight with anxiety—stepped forward, intercepting the Blackwoods.

But no one had anticipated just how shameless Caleb could be. Desperate to achieve his goal, he abandoned all pretense of civility. Shoving past the crowd, he charged toward the break room like a man possessed, his actions mirroring those of a husband catching an unfaithful wife. The onlookers buzzed with excitement, eager for the impending scandal.

The reporters, especially, threw all decorum aside in their hunger for a juicy exposé, surging forward like vultures.

The door burst open. Without even looking, Caleb bellowed, "What the hell is going on here?"

A woman’s shrill scream pierced the air. "Ah!"

"Could that really be Lucas and Beatrice?" Luna Morgan gasped from the back of the crowd.

The expressions of the Winters and Holloway families darkened instantly. They pushed through the throng, desperate to reach the front. Lydia’s face turned stormy, and she whirled around, her gaze locking onto Penelope Collins at the rear. Just as she suspected, a cold smirk curled the woman’s lips.

Seeing that smirk, Lydia’s blood ran cold. It hit her like a slap—Penelope despised her own son to such an extent that she would orchestrate his ruin over mere superstition.

Beatrice had just become engaged to Caleb. If she were caught in a compromising situation with Lucas now, he’d be branded as the man who seduced his cousin’s fiancée. The scandal would obliterate his reputation, let alone his chances of ever inheriting the Winters family legacy.

Lydia’s heart sank. Disaster loomed, inevitable and devastating.

The spectators, meanwhile, were electrified. Whispers swelled into excited chatter, drawing even more curious onlookers.

Everyone was here for one thing—drama.

At the same time, their friends rushed forward, faces etched with concern. These two had never been tangled in scandal before. If something had truly happened, it would be catastrophic.

The atmosphere in the room shifted abruptly, turning tense and charged with an unspoken warning.

The flashes of cameras, which had been relentless moments ago, suddenly ceased as if someone had flipped a switch. A cold, suffocating aura seeped from the doorway, sending an unmistakable message—someone was furious.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as a voice, sharp as ice, sliced through the silence.

"Who gave you the right to barge in on my wife and me without knocking? Is this how the Winters family treats their guests? Get. Out."

The members of the Blackwood family and their small entourage froze. That voice—deep, commanding, and laced with barely restrained fury—could only belong to one man: Nathan Blackwood. And the softer, startled voice that had called out moments before? That had been Evelyn Sinclair's.

The reporters at the front recoiled, their faces paling. The sheer dominance radiating from Nathan made it clear—this was not a man to cross. And worse, they had just interrupted what was clearly an intimate moment between a married couple. Not a scandal. Not even close.

Panicked, they scrambled backward, clutching their cameras like lifelines.

"Delete every photo you took. Unless you'd like to explain yourselves to Blackwood Group's legal team," Nathan warned, his tone leaving no room for argument.

That single sentence sent them into a frenzy. Fingers flew over screens, hastily erasing any trace of what they'd captured. No one wanted to tangle with Blackwood Group's lawyers—unless they had a death wish.

A few of the sharper individuals in the crowd quickly pieced together who they were dealing with. Nathan Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Group, and Evelyn Sinclair, the Justice Upholder.

Rumors of their marriage had circulated before, but many had dismissed them as baseless gossip. Now, seeing them together like this—her pressed against him, his arm wrapped protectively around her—there was no denying it.

No wonder the Justice Upholder could afford to make so many enemies without consequence. Her husband’s influence was not something to be trifled with.

"Mr. Moore has really screwed us over this time," one of them muttered under their breath. "We need to get out of here before they remember our faces."

Meanwhile, Caleb Moore, standing at the very front, gaped at the scene before him, his face draining of color.

"What the hell is going on?" Luna Morgan pushed forward, her eyes widening as she took in the sight.

There, on the couch, sat Nathan Blackwood, his arms wrapped securely around Evelyn Sinclair, who had buried her face against his shoulder, clearly shaken.

The two of them had clearly been in the middle of something private—whether a heated embrace or a stolen kiss—before being rudely interrupted. No wonder Nathan was livid.

And the worst part?

The room was empty except for them.

No scandal. No secret rendezvous. Just a married couple who had been very clearly enjoying each other’s company before being ambushed.

This was not the explosive revelation Caleb had promised.

And now, judging by the murderous glint in Nathan’s eyes, someone was about to pay for it.
###Chapter 276 - The Tangled Web

The morning light spilled through the curtains of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sat at her vanity, her fingers absently tracing the delicate silver locket around her neck—a gift from Nathan Blackwood, one she hadn’t taken off since the night he’d given it to her.

A sharp knock at the door jolted her from her thoughts.

"Evelyn, we have a problem." Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, strode in, clutching a tablet. Her usually composed expression was tight with urgency.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What now?"

Lillian swiped the screen and turned it toward her. "Victoria Hayes just leaked a private recording of you and Nathan to the press."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. She snatched the tablet, her stomach twisting as she saw the headline:

"Evelyn Sinclair’s Secret Affair with Nathan Blackwood—Full Audio Inside."

Her fingers trembled as she pressed play. The recording was from months ago—a heated argument between her and Nathan, one filled with raw emotion and confessions neither of them had meant to make public.

"This is bad," Evelyn muttered, her mind racing. Victoria had always been a thorn in her side, but this? This was outright sabotage.

Lillian hesitated. "There’s more. The media’s already spinning it as proof you manipulated Nathan into leaving his family for you."

Evelyn scoffed. "Of course they are."

She tossed the tablet onto the bed and stood, pacing the length of the room. The timing couldn’t be worse—Nathan was in the middle of finalizing his divorce, and this scandal would only complicate things.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathan lit up the screen:

"We need to talk. Now."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She knew what that meant—damage control. But before she could reply, another notification popped up.

This one from Serena Whitmore, her agent:

"Turn on the news. Now."

Evelyn grabbed the remote and flicked on the wall-mounted TV. The screen flashed to a live press conference—Nathan, standing at a podium, his expression unreadable.

Reporters shouted questions, but his voice cut through the chaos like steel.

"I won’t address baseless rumors," he said, his tone firm. "But I will say this—Evelyn Sinclair is not the villain in this story. If anyone’s reputation should be questioned, it’s the person who recorded and leaked a private conversation."

Evelyn’s breath caught. He was defending her. Publicly.

But then the camera panned to the side—and there stood Victoria, smirking like she’d already won.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

This wasn’t just a scandal.

It was war.

"Why are you here?" Luna shrieked, her voice cracking with hysteria. She had been the last to see Beatrice and Lucas together, tangled in sheets just moments ago—utterly vulnerable to her schemes. Yet now, mere minutes later, they'd been replaced by these two.

"Where are Beatrice and Lucas?" Caleb demanded, his eyes darting around the room as if expecting them to materialize from the shadows.

Nathan's jaw tightened, his patience evaporating. He saw no point in explanations. Instead, he leveled them with a glacial stare that could freeze hell itself.

The air grew thick with tension, suffocatingly so.

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Nathan said coolly, his tone so indifferent it left no room for doubt. "If you're so desperate to find someone, why waste time here?"

"This doesn't make sense—did you—" Caleb's outburst was cut short by a sharp crack.

Vivian stepped forward and slapped her son hard across the face. "Enough! You're making a drunken spectacle of yourself in front of our guests."

After scolding him, she turned to Nathan and Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Forgive us. We've made a terrible mistake. I'll return later to offer a proper apology."

"Mrs. Bennett, that won't be necessary," Evelyn murmured, her voice muffled but firm. "The one who caused this should be the one to apologize."

Vivian's smile deepened, her sharp eyes locking onto Nathan's. A silent understanding passed between them—he had just saved the Winters family from disaster.

She didn't know where those two had vanished to, but leading this mob away was the only logical move.

"Out!" Vivian shoved Caleb toward the door, her patience fraying.

Caleb, still reeling from the public humiliation, clutched his stinging cheek. His glare burned with indignation. "Something's wrong here! Those two—"

"You!" Vivian couldn't believe her own flesh and blood could be so consumed by malice, so willing to destroy lives. Is this really my son?

As mother and son teetered on the brink of open conflict, Richard pushed forward, attempting to mediate. "How did this happen? There must be some misunderstanding."

"Today is your engagement party," Vivian hissed, her voice low and dangerous. "Don't dare ruin it."

The steel in her tone finally struck fear into Caleb, silencing him.

Everyone assumed it was just a misunderstanding. Not wanting to stir up trouble, they all quietly decided to leave.

"No, they have to be here somewhere!" Luna was growing increasingly frantic. They had been drugged. Even if they had somehow woken up and tried to escape, they wouldn’t have made it far in their condition.

She threw caution to the wind. "I saw them together with my own eyes! If we keep searching, we’ll find them!"

"This is absurd!" The Blackwood family was livid. "Who let this delusional woman in here? Get her out now!"

The moment Luna was called delusional, chaos erupted. Penelope, who had been standing by in confusion, suddenly snapped. "How dare you speak to my daughter like that?"

Margaret swiftly signaled security, ushering everyone out before the argument could escalate further.

If Beatrice and Lucas didn’t emerge soon, this situation would spiral out of control.

The last to leave were the Blackwoods. They had only come to enjoy the spectacle, but now, they were treated to the rare sight of their son holding his wife close, both grinning like fools. It was a moment so sweet, it almost made the entire fiasco worth it.

Only when the door clicked shut did Nathan finally release Evelyn.

Evelyn’s eyes sparkled with excitement, clearly thrilled by how smoothly they had handled the crisis.

"You were amazing. Everything went exactly as you planned!" she gushed, her praise rare enough to make Nathan’s lips twitch in satisfaction.

"Let’s check on them first. For now, they stay hidden—just in case someone barges in again. I’ll have a private doctor handle them discreetly."

Evelyn nodded, moving toward the wardrobe to check on Beatrice. Good grief, what kind of sleeping pill had they used? Beatrice looked like she wouldn’t wake up anytime soon.

As Nathan stepped closer to inspect, he quickly updated their allies via text, instructing them to bring in a doctor quietly. He also made sure they knew Margaret would assist if needed.

Meanwhile, the group chat was exploding with theories, the outrage reaching a boiling point.

"He actually drugged his own friends? Is he out of his damn mind?"

They assured Nathan they’d keep watch outside and handle any loose ends.

But Margaret barely had time to help—the hall had devolved into shouting matches and accusations.

Nathan caught snippets of Evelyn’s racing thoughts.

Was Luna truly this naive, or was she just a pawn? She refused to back down, insisting she’d seen everything. Now she was spinning wilder lies, hurling accusations left and right—

And all of it was being pinned on Lucas.

The accusations against Lucas were outrageous—as if they intended to paint him as some depraved monster with an unnatural obsession with his own sister-in-law. Was she seriously planning to ruin his reputation even if she couldn’t catch him in the act? She was just as foolish and vindictive as her mother. Despite how absurd Luna’s claims were, she sounded convincing simply because she was his sister. I couldn’t believe she would stoop this low!

Meanwhile, Nathan had been receiving updates from his group chat and family. Though they had tried to counter the rumors, most people were still more inclined to believe the scandalous gossip.

After all, spreading lies was easy. Stopping them? Nearly impossible.

And with both Lucas and Beatrice missing, things only looked worse.

Evelyn thought, No one can stop that lunatic now. Caleb was putting on a grand performance, insisting on searching the entire estate. They knew the drug’s effects hadn’t worn off yet, meaning the situation could spiral out of control at any moment. Wait… that means Beatrice is still suffering, isn’t she? This wasn’t just about fabricating a scandal—this was about destroying Lucas completely. If Beatrice ended up hating him for this, it could sever their relationship entirely. How cruel. They’re pushing him toward absolute ruin.

Outside the bathroom, Nathan stood guard, watching as Lucas lost control of himself. He couldn’t even keep the towel between his teeth, his brows furrowed in agony. If not for the slippery bathtub keeping him trapped, he might have thrashed around even more violently.

Evelyn mused, Mrs. Lydia is sharper than I thought. She knew the two were safely hidden, so she didn’t let her nerves betray her. Instead, she let Caleb and his group continue their ridiculous charade.

Nathan had also received a message. Everyone agreed this was the best approach—it gave them the perfect timing to bring in the doctor.

Now, all they had to do was wait.

Evelyn turned to Nathan, curiosity burning. "How is he?"

Nathan didn’t let her get too close. Instead, he pulled her down to sit beside him, explaining the situation in hushed tones.

Finally, unable to hold back, Evelyn asked, "I can’t believe how far they’re willing to go. Forget the twisted motives—just the sheer audacity of it all… Lucas and Beatrice aren’t going to let this slide, are they? Once the truth comes out, where will these people even run? They can’t possibly think they can talk their way out of this, right? People aren’t that stupid."

###Chapter 277 The Game is Afoot

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the same line for the fifth time.

Why can’t I focus?

Her phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. A message from Nathan Blackwood flashed on the screen:

"Meeting at 10. Don’t be late."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. As if she needed the reminder. The Blackwood Media merger was the biggest deal of her career, and Nathan’s constant micromanaging was grating on her last nerve.

She tossed the phone aside and stood, stretching. The penthouse was too quiet—too empty. Even the luxurious silence felt oppressive.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Who is it?" she called, padding barefoot across the marble floor.

"Lillian," came the muffled reply.

Evelyn opened the door to find her assistant, Lillian Graves, holding two steaming cups of coffee and a file tucked under her arm.

"You look like you need this," Lillian said, handing her a cup.

Evelyn took it gratefully, the rich aroma of espresso grounding her. "Bless you."

Lillian smirked. "I also brought the revised contract. Nathan’s lawyers made more changes."

Evelyn groaned. "Of course they did."

She flipped open the file, scanning the highlighted sections. Her grip tightened on the cup.

"He can’t be serious."

Lillian winced. "He is. Clause 12-B now states that any creative decisions regarding your projects require his approval."

Evelyn’s blood boiled. "That wasn’t part of the deal."

Lillian hesitated. "He says it’s non-negotiable."

Evelyn set the coffee down with a sharp clink. "We’ll see about that."

Nathan Blackwood leaned back in his leather chair, watching the cityscape through his office windows. The view from the 50th floor was impressive, but his mind was elsewhere.

His intercom buzzed.

"Sir, Evelyn Sinclair is here," his secretary, Victoria Hayes, announced.

Nathan smirked. "Send her in."

The door swung open, and Evelyn stormed in, her emerald eyes blazing. She slammed the contract onto his desk.

"Explain this."

Nathan didn’t flinch. "It’s standard."

"Standard?" Evelyn scoffed. "Since when does standard mean handing over creative control?"

Nathan stood, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. "Since I’m the one funding your next film."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Then maybe I’ll find another investor."

Nathan’s smirk faded. "You won’t. Not after what happened with Holloway Pictures."

Evelyn stiffened. How did he know about that?

Nathan circled his desk, stopping inches from her. "Sign the contract, Evelyn. Or walk away and lose everything."

Her pulse pounded in her ears. She’d worked too hard to let him bulldoze her.

But before she could retort, her phone rang.

Unknown caller.

She hesitated, then answered.

A distorted voice hissed through the line:

"You shouldn’t have trusted him."

The call disconnected.

Evelyn’s breath caught. Nathan’s gaze sharpened.

"Who was that?"

She swallowed hard. "No one."

But the warning echoed in her mind.

What game was Nathan really playing?

And more importantly—who else was involved?

They weren't insane—just bolder than most.

#MissionAccomplished

Pain was a small price to pay if it meant destroying their enemy. The end justified the means.

Evelyn's brows furrowed in confusion, prompting Nathan to explain.

"If this scandal goes public, even if Beatrice and Lucas expose Caleb, it won’t matter. Because regardless of manipulation, something did happen between Lucas and Beatrice. Remember how Caleb behaved during the engagement?"

A spark of realization lit Evelyn's eyes. "If this had occurred before the engagement, they could’ve spun it as mutual affection. But now? Their status changed. This isn’t just a mistake—it’s betrayal."

Nathan nodded. "Even if the Bennett family learns Lucas was framed, they won’t risk further scandal. They’ll have to choose which son to protect. With Lucas already compromised, they’ll side with the 'victim'—Caleb. As for Beatrice? She’ll be discarded like yesterday’s news. The Holloways won’t have a say. Justice is irrelevant when family reputation is at stake."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "They’re monsters. Targeting Lucas is one thing, but ruining an innocent woman for their schemes? Do they have no shame?"

Nathan’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "Shame is a luxury they can’t afford."

"Now that we’ve stopped it, can’t we expose the truth?" Evelyn clenched her fists. She refused to let them win.

Nathan shrugged. "That’s their battle to fight."

A vibration cut through the tension—Nathan’s phone. He glanced at the screen, then strode to the window. Shadows shifted, and three figures slipped inside: Vivian, Daniel, and a doctor.

Vivian rushed to Beatrice’s side, lifting her limp form. Seeing her unconscious, she slammed a fist into the mattress. "I’ll skin those bastards alive."

The examination was swift. A single injection, and Beatrice stirred.

Lucas required more care. After sedation, the doctor tended to his wounds.

By the time Lucas stabilized, Beatrice was awake—and furious. She bolted upright, senses sharpened by adrenaline. The unnatural sleep had been a red flag. Now, every nerve screamed danger.

The bizarre situation made her face pale instantly. "What's wrong with me?"

Evelyn quickly explained everything that had happened, then asked pointedly, "It was Caleb who drugged you, wasn't it?"

Beatrice's face drained of all color, her body trembling violently. Clenching her fists, she whispered, "Yes."

Just as she was about to speak, a pained groan echoed from the bathroom.

Beatrice stiffened, her expression turning even more ashen.

Evelyn, assuming she was worried about that matter, reassured her gently, "You're completely unharmed. Trust me, he restrained himself."

Vivian, ever the joker, smirked and quipped, "Does Caleb even know Lucas's preferences?"

Evelyn choked on air, whipping her head toward Vivian.

Daniel, who had been discussing the situation outside with Nathan, froze mid-sentence. He shot Vivian an exasperated look. "Don't spread rumors. Lucas doesn’t like men."

Vivian shrugged, unfazed. "Isn’t it obvious? The guy’s been single forever. I’ve always suspected he’s secretly crushing on someone in our circle. Probably stayed single because he knew he couldn’t have them."

Then, with a mischievous grin, she turned to Evelyn. "Honestly? I think it’s your husband."

Evelyn couldn’t help it—she burst out laughing.

Vivian’s got half of it right, she thought, amused. He did have feelings for someone in the group, and he stayed single because he knew they were unattainable. But… oh, she’s so off the mark! If Caleb had this kind of imagination, maybe tonight’s victim would’ve been one of the guys instead. Hah!

Nathan just sighed. This woman’s imagination is something else.

"What’s so funny? You think my theory’s ridiculous?" Vivian pointed at Beatrice. "She’s living proof. Even drugged, he’d rather hurt himself than touch her. If that’s not proof he’s into men, what is? I can’t think of any other explanation."

Evelyn bit back another laugh. Or maybe it’s because he cares too much? Because he couldn’t bear seeing the disgust in Beatrice’s eyes if he hurt her.

"Is… is that so?" she managed between giggles. "Guess I’ll have to keep a closer eye on my husband from now on."

Vivian cackled, and even Daniel couldn’t suppress a chuckle.

Nathan just shook his head in disbelief.

The lighthearted banter helped ease the tension, and Beatrice gradually relaxed. As for Vivian’s wild speculations? She didn’t believe a word of it—she knew Lucas’s character better than that.

A sudden commotion erupted from the restroom area. The doctor's urgent voice summoned them inside.

Nathan swiftly assisted Lucas Thornton, now dressed in fresh clothes, to emerge from the bathroom. Though exhaustion lined Lucas's face, his first instinct was to search for Beatrice Holloway in the crowd.

That single glance sent an electric jolt through Beatrice. Her pupils dilated as if struck by lightning, a dawning realization flickering behind her eyes. Somewhere deep within her heart, a seed of possibility took root.

"Beatrice, you're unharmed?" Lucas's voice came out rough with concern. "I swear nothing inappropriate happened between us."

Beatrice gave a slow nod, her gaze hardening like tempered steel. "I've pieced together what occurred," she stated coldly. "Regardless of consequences, I won't let this slide."

Lucas hesitated, the memory of his earlier desperation flooding back. His jaw tightened with resolve. "I... agree. But you must understand - if we go public with this—"

"I don't give a damn about scandals or whispers!" Beatrice snapped, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "No one humiliates me and walks away unscathed."

Their eyes locked in silent understanding before Lucas finally inclined his head.

Evelyn Sinclair observed the exchange with barely concealed amusement. Oh, this was getting delicious.

A tap on her shoulder interrupted her thoughts. Turning, she found Vivian Moore studying her with newfound respect.

"There's something extraordinary about you," Vivian murmured, eyes glittering with excitement. "Following you always leads to the juiciest dramas."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Was that... a compliment?

The subsequent events unfolded like a well-choreographed play, with Lucas and Beatrice retreating to the wings, allowing their carefully laid plans to take center stage.

Emerging into the ballroom, they discovered the search party had returned empty-handed. Tension crackled in the air, especially after the discovery of a suspiciously disheveled private room bearing all the hallmarks of an illicit rendezvous.

Caleb Moore and Luna Morgan exchanged smug glances, their triumphant expressions suggesting they'd already won. The simultaneous disappearance of two prominent figures under such compromising circumstances had even the most skeptical guests whispering behind their hands.

Penelope Collins's face darkened like a gathering storm—until Evelyn and Nathan materialized in the grand hall.

Then, the call finally connected.

"Father?" Beatrice's voice rang clear and composed through the speaker. "Why the incessant calls? Is something wrong?"
###Chapter 278 I Won't Let Him Get Away With This

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the latest revisions. The role was challenging—a woman torn between love and ambition—and Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing.

Her phone buzzed, breaking her concentration. A text from her agent, Serena Whitmore, flashed on the screen:

"Nathan Blackwood just confirmed for the lead. Filming starts Monday. You’re welcome."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Nathan Blackwood—Hollywood’s most enigmatic heartthrob, notorious for his brooding intensity and scandalous past. They’d never worked together before, but the rumors alone were enough to make her pulse quicken.

She typed back, fingers trembling slightly: "Since when does he do rom-coms?"

Serena’s reply was instant: "Since the paycheck had an extra zero. And since the director promised creative control. Don’t overthink it. Chemistry reads are tomorrow. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned, tossing her phone onto the couch. Chemistry reads with Nathan Blackwood? The man who’d famously walked off set last year after a co-star mispronounced his character’s name? This was either a career-making opportunity or a disaster waiting to happen.

Across town, Nathan leaned against the polished mahogany bar of his private lounge, swirling a glass of bourbon. His manager, Marcus Donovan, eyed him warily.

"You’re really doing this?" Marcus asked. "A fluffy romance? After turning down three Oscar-bait dramas?"

Nathan smirked, the dim light catching the sharp angles of his face. "Evelyn Sinclair’s attached. She’s… interesting."

Marcus raised a brow. "Interesting? Or are you just bored?"

Nathan didn’t answer. He’d seen Evelyn’s work—raw, unfiltered emotion wrapped in effortless charm. She wasn’t like the others. And that intrigued him more than he cared to admit.

Meanwhile, in a sleek high-rise office, Victoria Hayes—Nathan’s former secretary and current thorn in Evelyn’s side—scrolled through the casting announcement with a scowl. She’d spent years curating Nathan’s image, steering him away from "beneath him" projects like this. And now Evelyn Sinclair waltzed in?

Victoria’s nails tapped against her desk. If Nathan wanted to play with fire, she’d make sure Evelyn got burned.

Back in her penthouse, Evelyn stared at the script again, a new determination settling in her chest. She wouldn’t let Nathan Blackwood—or his drama—derail this. She’d worked too hard.

But as she rehearsed her lines, she couldn’t ignore the flutter in her stomach. Tomorrow, she’d face the man who’d haunted tabloids and daydreams alike. And somehow, she already knew: nothing about this would go as planned.

Anxiety gnawed at Beatrice's father as he barked into the phone, "Where the hell have you been? We've been searching everywhere! Who are you with? Why aren't you answering your calls?"

A tense silence stretched before Beatrice finally responded, her voice laced with confusion. "What’s the big deal? I got a sudden burst of inspiration and worked in the car. I had my phone on silent—I always do that. Didn’t you say you didn’t need me there?"

The Holloways exhaled in relief, recalling her habit of disappearing into her creative zone. "Just come home. Something’s happened. And—have you seen Lucas?"

"No. What’s going on?"

The Holloways exchanged uneasy glances before replying, "We’ll explain when you get back."

As soon as the call ended, they turned to Luna and Caleb, their expressions hardening. "You heard her?"

Luna and Caleb exchanged skeptical looks. Too convenient. Something’s off.

"Who knows what’s really going on?" Luna muttered stubbornly.

Caleb remained silent, but his narrowed eyes spoke volumes.

"Well, we’ll see how long you can keep spinning lies. At this rate, we might have to reconsider this entire arrangement," the Holloways snapped.

After the way they’ve insulted our daughter, we can’t just let this slide.

But instead of Beatrice, it was Lucas who walked through the door next.

His reappearance instantly drew everyone’s attention—especially since he had changed clothes.

Lydia, ever trusting, was the first to speak. "Didn’t I send you to handle something? Where have you been? You were gone for ages, and no one could reach you!"

Lucas lifted his freshly bandaged hand, the gauze stained with blood. "Sorry, Aunt Lydia. I did go, but I took a nasty fall. My clothes were soaked, and I cut my hand. Had to patch myself up before coming back. And my phone—" He held up the device, water still dripping from it. "—got waterlogged. It’s dead."

Lydia sighed in relief, satisfied.

But Caleb wasn’t buying it. He stepped forward, eyes blazing. "What a convenient excuse. Both of you just happen to vanish at the same time, and both your phones happen to fail? Do you really think we’re that stupid?"

His words hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

The tension was suffocating.

And the truth?

It was far from over.

"Stop pretending!" Caleb Moore's voice was laced with venom as he glared at Lucas Thornton. "Did you sleep with my fiancée? How could you betray me like this? At our engagement party, no less! You're nothing but a filthy traitor!"

Lucas scoffed, his expression darkening. "What the hell are you even talking about? Someone explain this nonsense to me."

Vivian Grant watched Luna Morgan with icy disdain. Even now, she refuses to control herself. Does she truly not care about the Winters family's reputation?

A bystander quickly recounted the events, and Lucas burst into laughter. "So, based on baseless rumors, you're accusing me without proof? By that logic, why don’t you check everyone’s phones? If someone left early or was too busy to answer, would you accuse them of cheating too?"

"I saw it with my own eyes!" Luna snapped, refusing to back down.

Lucas’s chest tightened as he looked at her. I thought I was numb to this pain, but it still feels like a knife twisting in my chest. Does she really hate me this much? That twisted, ugly expression—it’s exactly like Mother’s. And Mother orchestrated this whole mess. I’m so damn tired of this.

"So," Lucas said, his voice heavy with exhaustion, "just because I told Mother about your plans to join the entertainment industry and stopped you, you decided to destroy me? Our relationship has always been strained, but we’re still siblings! There should be limits to your cruelty." The raw disappointment in his voice made a few onlookers hesitate.

After all, Luna was known for being impulsive and selfish. And their sibling rivalry was no secret.

"You—!" Luna stammered, caught in her own lie. She could only double down. "It’s the truth! You are involved with her! You’re obsessed with your own cousin’s fiancée!"

Lucas’s expression darkened instantly.

Caleb smirked. His reaction says it all. Something definitely happened. And if it did… I’ll make sure he pays.

"Hmph! I don’t believe a word you say. We’ll settle this once Beatrice returns," Caleb declared. There’s no way he’s walking away from this unscathed. Unless the heavens themselves intervene.

As if on cue, a flicker of panic crossed Lucas’s face. Caleb’s triumph surged.

"We’re innocent," Lucas said coolly. "But if you insist on making a scene, fine. However, you’re coming with me first. I still have un business for Mrs. Grant, and you’re going to help me."

His demand was baffling.

Some assumed he was putting duty first, proving his integrity.

Others wondered if he was guilty—trying to bribe or threaten Caleb into silence.

Caleb’s smirk widened. Look at you, Lucas Thornton, always so composed. Now you’re scrambling. This is going to be fun.

"What could possibly be more urgent than clearing your name?" Caleb demanded, tilting his chin up with an air of defiance.

"It's a private family matter. Come with me." Lucas's voice carried an edge of desperation, which only fueled Caleb's smug satisfaction.

"I'm not going anywhere. I'll wait right here for Beatrice to return," Caleb retorted, his lips curling into a smirk. He felt invincible, as if he had already won.

"Aunt Ava, I truly can't handle this alone. I need Caleb's help," Lucas pleaded, turning to Ava with a look of urgency.

Ava, sharp as ever, suspected Lucas was trying to manipulate Caleb into changing his story. Still, she nodded. "Go with him, Caleb. Don't be difficult. We can discuss everything when you return."

A surge of resentment flared in Caleb's chest. She always takes his side. But then, a darker thought crossed his mind—It doesn’t matter. Even if I go with him, the doubt about Lucas and Beatrice will linger in everyone’s minds. No matter what he says or does, he can’t erase that. A cruel smile tugged at his lips. In his panic, he’s only digging his own grave. Fine, I’ll go. I want to watch him crumble.

"Let me make one thing clear," Caleb announced loudly, ensuring everyone heard him. "If you think I’ll help you cover up your mess, you’re delusional."

He brushed past Lucas, but the latter didn’t follow immediately. Instead, Lucas approached Ava, his expression unreadable. Leaning in, he whispered words meant only for her ears:

"I'm sorry, Aunt Ava. But he crossed the line this time. I won’t spare him."

Ava’s breath hitched. A flicker of sorrow passed through her knowing eyes before she steadied herself. "I understand."

The air between them grew heavy with unspoken regret—but the game was already in motion.
###Chapter 279 The Cost of Arrogance
Mind Games and Juicy Revelations

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse as she sipped her latte, scrolling through her phone. A smirk played on her lips—today’s gossip columns were spicy.

"Seraphina Delacroix spotted cozying up to Adrian Cross at a private yacht party—just weeks after her messy breakup with Sebastian Hart."

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen. Oh, this is delicious. She could practically hear the tabloid editors cackling.

Then, her phone buzzed—a text from Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant:

"Nathan’s team just confirmed the merger. Press conference at noon. Also, Victoria Hayes is livid—she thought she’d secured the deal for herself."

Evelyn’s grin widened. Perfect.

She tapped out a reply: "Tell Preston Whitmore I want front-row seats to that disaster. And send flowers to Victoria—peonies. She hates peonies."

As she set her phone down, the mental image of Victoria’s face twisting in rage was almost too satisfying. But Evelyn’s amusement faded when another notification popped up—this time from an encrypted chat:

"The Blackwood files are ready. Meet me at the usual place. —D.S."

Her pulse quickened. Daniel Prescott. Sophia’s husband, Nathan’s brother-in-law… and the man sitting on a vault of Blackwood family secrets.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. Game on.

Scene Break

Across town, Nathan Blackwood adjusted his cufflinks in the mirror, his reflection cool and unreadable. The merger was a done deal, but the real battle was just beginning.

His phone lit up with a message from Marcus Donovan: "Heard from our insider—Vincent Holloway’s making moves. He’s got his sights set on the Delacroix scandal to distract from his own mess."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Vincent was a snake, but a useful one—if handled right.

A knock interrupted his thoughts. "Mr. Blackwood? Your sister’s here."

Sophia swept in, her designer heels clicking sharply. "You’re really going through with this merger? After what Evelyn pulled last time?"

Nathan met her gaze evenly. "Business is business."

Sophia scoffed. "And Evelyn’s playing business. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."

As she stormed out, Nathan’s phone buzzed again—an alert from his private investigator:

"Confirmed: Prescott’s meeting someone tonight. Location encrypted, but traces lead back to Sinclair Holdings."

Nathan’s fingers clenched around the phone. Evelyn.

That night, Evelyn slipped into a dimly lit jazz bar, her emerald-green dress drawing glances. At the back booth, Daniel Prescott waited, a manila envelope on the table between them.

"You’re playing a dangerous game," he murmured.

Evelyn smirked, reaching for the envelope. "Aren’t we all?"

But as her fingers brushed the file, the door burst open—flashlights blinding them.

"NYPD! Hands where we can see them!"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Setup.

And standing behind the officers?

Nathan Blackwood, his expression ice.

"Hello, Evelyn."

Evelyn Sinclair understood exactly what Lucas Thornton meant. She knew he had been targeted countless times in the past, yet he had always refrained from retaliating against Caleb Moore—largely because of her.

Truth be told, Evelyn had always carried a quiet guilt over this. She had poured her heart into raising her child, hoping to compensate for the unspoken debt she felt.

But this time, things had gone too far. Innocent people had been dragged into Caleb’s schemes. Lucas wasn’t going to let it slide anymore—and frankly, Evelyn didn’t blame him. A man destined to lead the Winters family couldn’t afford to be lenient with such reckless behavior.

More than that, Evelyn couldn’t help but feel she had failed as a mother. Minor reprimands hadn’t worked. Maybe it was time for Caleb to face real consequences—something that would finally make him think twice before acting.

If stubbornness was Caleb’s defining trait, then perhaps what Lucas had planned would finally knock some sense into him.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. This was the right path.

Meanwhile, Evelyn couldn’t help but sigh as she observed everything unfolding before her, the system feeding her details of the plan in real time.

They say spoiled children are the result of indulgent mothers, but Mdm. Lydia was anything but indulgent. She was strict, even harsh at times. And yet, Caleb turned out like this. Some people are just born rotten, aren’t they?

A ridiculous thought crossed her mind—Maybe Lucas should have been Mdm. Lydia’s son, and Caleb should have been Mrs. Willis’s. Mrs. Willis never treated Lucas well anyway.

She nearly laughed at the absurdity of it. What a cliché. I must be losing my mind to even entertain such a thought.

Nathan Blackwood, standing beside her, didn’t dwell on the matter. Though Penelope Collins’s attitude toward Caleb was polite, it lacked warmth. There were reasons she wasn’t kind to Lucas—reasons that, while they might invite criticism, were understandable.

Around them, murmurs rose from the gathered crowd.

"What’s happening? What are they planning?"

"Should he fight back or just let it go?"

"Fight back, obviously. No way he should let this slide."

In truth, Daniel Wright and Amelia Bennett, who had just returned, weren’t privy to the specifics. Beatrice Holloway and Lucas had arranged everything.

Just then, the hall erupted into murmurs again. Heads turned as Beatrice strode back in, her expression unreadable.

The Carneys immediately stepped forward, ready to explain, but Beatrice raised a hand. "I know what you all want to ask. And I’m about to show you the truth."

With that, she walked toward the stage where the engagement ceremony had taken place moments ago. She pulled out her phone, fingers moving swiftly over the screen.

Evelyn smirked. A livestream? Clever.

The tension in the room thickened as the first flickers of the broadcast appeared on the large screens. Whatever was about to unfold, it was clear—pride was about to come with a very steep price.

The crowd remained in stunned silence, their eyes darting between the screen and Beatrice Holloway, unsure of what she was about to reveal.

Meanwhile, Penelope Collins and Luna Morgan shifted uncomfortably in their seats, a creeping sense of dread tightening their chests.

As for the relentless paparazzi, they stubbornly adjusted their cameras, eager to capture whatever scandal was about to unfold.

The massive screen, which had initially displayed a photograph of Beatrice and Caleb Moore, suddenly flickered to life with a video call. Though no faces were visible, the unmistakable backdrop confirmed it was filmed nearby.

Then, the voices of two men echoed through the hall.

Lucas Thornton had dragged Caleb into the secluded garden before his voice erupted in fury. "Why the hell would you do this?"

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Caleb replied smoothly, his tone dripping with feigned innocence.

Lucas scoffed. "Cut the act. There are no cameras here, and we both know it. I knew you wouldn’t let me walk away unscathed, and sure enough, I fell right into your trap. But tell me—why go this far? Has our relationship really deteriorated to the point where you’d sacrifice your own fiancée’s reputation just to ruin me?"

His expression was a mix of anguish and defiance. Had Caleb not been so eager to savor Lucas’s defeat, he might have been more cautious. But the temptation to gloat was too strong.

After years of being overshadowed, Caleb finally had the upper hand—and he couldn’t resist rubbing it in.

He glanced around quickly, confirming they were alone, before bursting into mocking laughter. "Oh, Lucas. No matter how much the elders praise you, in the end, you still lost to me!"

The damning words reverberated through the hall, plunging the room into stunned silence.

Then—chaos erupted.

"Holy hell! Did he just admit to setting this up?"

"So they did sleep together, but it was all Caleb’s doing?"

"What kind of man willingly makes himself a cuckold? He’s lost his damn mind!"

Penelope and Luna’s faces drained of color. They shot to their feet, ready to intervene—but before they could take a single step, four towering bodyguards shoved them back into their seats.

"Let us go!" Penelope shrieked, but her voice was drowned out by the uproar. Her frantic struggles only made her look unhinged.

"Help! Someone—!" Luna’s cries were even more desperate.

With a sharp flick of her wrist, Lydia signaled the guards, who promptly clamped hands over the women’s mouths, silencing them.

Well played, someone murmured in the crowd. Madam Lydia is really exposing her own son.

And yet, the real spectacle was Caleb—his arrogance had been his downfall.

It was painfully clear now—Lucas had outmaneuvered him.

The game was far from over.

The trap had been perfectly set—only someone who knew Lucas Thornton intimately could orchestrate such a scheme. After all, villains always fell victim to their own arrogance. Pride came with a price, and Caleb Moore would soon pay dearly for his. A smirk curled Evelyn Sinclair's lips.

Nathan Blackwood recognized this as the best strategy Lucas could devise. Unless Caleb confessed everything with his own words, any accusations would only lead to endless arguments, leaving Lucas and Beatrice Holloway's reputations forever stained. But if Lucas played his cards right, the outcome might exceed expectations. Now, everything hinged on Lucas's ability to manipulate the conversation.

Of course, Lucas wouldn’t let the other two off easily. His voice dripped with cold amusement as he said, "I didn’t lose to you, Caleb. I lost to my own mother and sister. How did you convince them to drug me? Did you threaten them, or did you promise them something in return?"

Caleb’s laughter boomed through the hall, arrogant and unrestrained. "Still making excuses for them, are you? Since you’re  anyway, I might as well enlighten you. The entire plan was your mother’s idea. She didn’t want you to inherit the Winters family, so she came to me for help. Once your reputation was ruined, the Winters would never accept you as their heir. Your own flesh and blood despises you enough to destroy everything you’ve built. How pathetic is that?"

Caleb, knowing full well of Penelope Collins’s affection for Lucas, deliberately targeted his emotions by dragging his mother into this. What he didn’t realize was that in doing so, he had just exposed his own schemes—along with Luna Morgan and Penelope’s treachery.

By now, the crowd in the hall had erupted into chaos.

Luna and Penelope stood frozen, their faces drained of color as they stared at the screen in horror. Their minds reeled—how had everything unraveled so spectacularly? In mere seconds, their carefully constructed lies had crumbled into dust.

When the weight of hundreds of accusing eyes turned toward them, panic finally seized them.

###Chapter 280 The Full Exposure
Mind Games and Juicy Revelations

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind already buzzing with the latest scandal she’d overheard at last night’s gala.

Oh, the things people think when they believe no one’s listening.

A smirk played on her lips as she recalled the mental chaos she’d absorbed—Victoria Hayes’ frantic internal monologue about her dwindling influence, Nathan Blackwood’s conflicted thoughts about their latest argument, and the most delicious tidbit of all: Seraphina Delacroix’s secret rendezvous with Sebastian Hart, despite her very public relationship with Adrian Cross.

Evelyn reached for her phone, scrolling through the morning’s headlines with amusement. The tabloids hadn’t caught wind of Seraphina’s little indiscretion yet, but it was only a matter of time.

Should I drop a hint to the press? she mused, tapping her fingers against the screen. No, better to let it simmer. Explosions are more fun when they’re unexpected.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, knocked lightly before entering with a tray of coffee and pastries. “Morning, Evelyn. You look… scheming.”

Evelyn grinned. “Because I am. Did you know Seraphina was spotted leaving Sebastian’s penthouse at three in the morning?”

Lillian’s eyes widened. “You’re joking.”

“Oh, I wish I were.” Evelyn took a sip of her coffee, savoring the rich flavor. “The best part? Adrian has no idea. He’s still gushing about her in interviews.”

Lillian shook her head. “That woman has a death wish.”

“Or a talent for self-destruction.” Evelyn set her cup down. “Either way, it’s going to be spectacular when it blows up.”

Her phone buzzed with an incoming message from Preston Whitmore, the director of her latest project.

Preston: Emergency meeting at noon. Studio’s panicking over the reshoots.

Evelyn sighed. Drama on and off-screen.

She typed back a quick reply before turning to Lillian. “Cancel my morning appointments. I need to mentally prepare for whatever fresh hell Preston’s about to unleash.”

Lillian nodded, already pulling out her tablet. “Anything else?”

Evelyn’s smirk returned. “Keep an ear out for any whispers about Seraphina. I have a feeling today’s going to be very entertaining.”

As Lillian left, Evelyn leaned back against her pillows, her mind already racing with possibilities.

Who needs reality TV when you can read minds?

"No wonder she was so animated earlier. What a performance!"

.

"Looking back at how she shamelessly tarnished her own brother's reputation makes my stomach churn."

"They're deranged! Both mother and daughter are completely unhinged, treating their own flesh and blood like this."

"Not only are they twisted, but downright vicious. The words 'wicked' and 'ruthless' might as well be carved into their foreheads. Lucas is cursed to have relatives like them."

"Colluding with outsiders to betray your own son? That’s a level of depravity beyond comprehension."

"Caleb isn’t any better. He just called Lucas an animal. Ironic, considering he’s the one who truly fits the description."

"Still playing the victim? He should look in the mirror—does he even have the intellect to pull it off?"

"What a disgrace! He plotted to sabotage his own cousin, even offering up his own fiancée. Look at the Carney family’s expressions—utter humiliation!"

The Bennett family members wore equally grim expressions. All eyes flicked toward Lydia. As Caleb’s mother, they expected fury. Yet, to everyone’s shock, she remained eerily composed, seated with unsettling calm.

Penelope, witnessing this, seethed. Her eyes burned crimson with rage. Had she not been gagged and restrained, she would’ve lunged at Lydia by now.

Evelyn, who’d been enjoying the spectacle, suddenly sensed something amiss. Penelope’s hatred for Lydia was blatant. Was it just because Lydia had them restrained?

By now, Caleb had spilled everything. Seeing Lucas’s stormy expression, Caleb smirked. "I’ve been fair. I never touched Beatrice, and now she’s yours. Consider her a trade for the heir’s position. You’re already . Once Beatrice returns, it’s over."

Pausing, Caleb added arrogantly, "Kneel and beg, and I might spare you some dignity. But the heir’s position? Don’t even dream of it. You were always destined to lose to me."

Lucas’s demeanor shifted. He scoffed. "Lose? You resorted to underhanded tricks and call that victory? Aunt Lydia would be ashamed."

"Shut up! I gave you a chance, but you’re throwing it away? Fine. Then I’ll make sure you’re convicted for assaulting Beatrice." Caleb’s rage flared at Lucas’s defiance.

"You really think Beatrice would still cooperate after you drugged her?"

"She’s a woman who slept with her fiancé’s—"

The air crackled with tension as Caleb Moore smirked, his voice dripping with false sympathy. "Oh, she'll play the victim soon enough. But even if she tries to pretend nothing happened, it won't work. The choice isn't hers—it's mine."

Lucas Thornton let out a low, humorless chuckle. "You really think this will go your way?"

Too absorbed in his own twisted scheme, Caleb missed the dangerous edge in Lucas's tone.

"Don't underestimate me," Caleb sneered. "All we need is a doctor to examine Beatrice. If she refuses, then we'll know she's hiding something!"

A sharp crack echoed through the room as Lucas's fist connected with Caleb's jaw.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" Lucas growled, his composure slipping.

Even Evelyn and Nathan hadn't anticipated Caleb's vile plan—a blatant attack on Beatrice's dignity as a woman of high society.

All eyes turned to Beatrice on the stage. Her gaze was lowered, her expression frozen in ice.

"Go ahead, hit me again," Caleb taunted, wiping blood from his lip. "The more you do, the worse you'll look when we expose the truth!"

Lucas exhaled sharply, then smirked. "You're delusional, Caleb. Nothing happened between Beatrice and me."

Caleb scoffed. "Liar! Then why were you two hiding?"

"Do you even know how long the drug you gave me lasts?" Lucas's voice was glacial. "If we'd done anything, do you think I'd be standing here awake?"

For the first time, doubt flickered in Caleb's eyes.

"I was drugged. So was Beatrice. But I stayed conscious—cut my own hand to keep my mind clear until help arrived," Lucas continued.

A realization dawned on Caleb. "Nathan and Evelyn."

"Exactly. They brought a doctor. We were treated and just returned," Lucas said coldly. "Your plan failed. Beatrice is still untouched. You can't touch her."

Caleb's amusement vanished, replaced by fury. His glare was venomous, but then—he laughed.

"Is that so? Then why did you meet me alone? Even if you deny it, who will believe you? We found evidence!" Caleb spat. "I can still demand—"

The room held its breath. The game wasn't over yet.

The investigation into Beatrice would proceed, whether she consented or not. Nathan had made his suspicions clear—he refused to believe the Blackwood family would still name her as the heir with such damning accusations hanging over her.

"What crime scene?" Lucas's brows furrowed instantly.

Caleb, ever the smug opportunist, smirked. "The one left behind after your little encounter, of course."

"Bullshit!" Lucas's voice was sharp, laced with fury. "That room was another one of your setups."

"So what if it was?" Caleb shrugged, his grin widening. "Call it bad luck. That room? It was mine and your sister’s doing. You were the one who hid away like a coward. When someone stumbled upon it, I thought—why not let you take the fall?" His laughter echoed, cruel and mocking.

As always, Caleb took pleasure in twisting the knife from the angle of family betrayal. Flaunting his involvement with Luna and their conspiracy to trap Lucas—it was all part of his sick satisfaction.

But for Lucas, none of it mattered anymore. His heart had shattered the moment he realized how deeply his own mother and sister had manipulated him.

Gasps rippled through the ballroom.

The guests exchanged horrified glances. No wonder Luna had turned against her own brother—she had chosen an outsider over blood. The wealthy elite thrived on scandal, but even this was too much. Poor Lucas, caught in the crossfire of his family’s treachery.

Luna’s face burned crimson. She had willingly entangled herself with Caleb, but she never expected him to expose her so publicly. The man had no filter, no sense of discretion. Now, her reputation was in ruins.

It was truly over.

Yet no one noticed Penelope—who had been thrashing in despair moments before—suddenly go still. At Caleb’s words, all fight left her. She stood frozen, her expression hollow, as if her soul had been ripped away.

The silence around her was deafening.
###Chapter 281 As Long As It Doesn't Destroy You
Whispers in the Shadows

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting delicate patterns across the marble floor. She sat curled up on her plush velvet sofa, a steaming cup of Earl Grey in one hand and her phone in the other. The screen glowed with the latest headline from Celebrity Pulse:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Exclusive Gala with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. The grainy photo showed Nathan, impeccably dressed in a tailored tuxedo, his arm draped casually around the waist of a statuesque brunette. The woman’s face was partially obscured, but Evelyn recognized the confident tilt of her chin—Victoria Hayes, Nathan’s cunning secretary.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Of course.

She scrolled further, her pulse quickening as she absorbed the details. The article speculated about a possible rekindled romance between Nathan and Victoria, citing their "undeniable chemistry" and "years of professional closeness." Comments from anonymous insiders hinted at a rift between Nathan and Evelyn, painting her as the jealous ex who couldn’t handle sharing the spotlight.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palm. Professional closeness? More like Victoria’s relentless scheming.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call—Serena Whitmore, her ever-loyal agent.

"Evelyn, darling, please tell me you haven’t seen the gossip rags yet," Serena sighed.

"Too late," Evelyn replied dryly. "I’ve already memorized every ridiculous word."

Serena groaned. "Ignore it. You know how these tabloids love to twist things. Nathan wouldn’t—"

"Wouldn’t what? Stab me in the back publicly? Again?" Evelyn cut in, her voice sharper than intended. She took a steadying breath. "It doesn’t matter. I have my own life to focus on."

But the seed of doubt had been planted.

As she ended the call, her gaze drifted to the framed photo on her mantel—a candid shot of her and Nathan laughing under the stars at last year’s charity gala. Back when things were simpler. Back when she thought she knew him.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Miss Sinclair?" Lillian Graves, her assistant, peeked in hesitantly. "Mr. Blackwood is here. He says it’s urgent."

Evelyn’s heart stuttered. Speak of the devil.

She smoothed her silk robe and schooled her expression into cool indifference. "Let him in."

The door swung open, and Nathan strode in, his usually composed demeanor frayed at the edges. His stormy gray eyes locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn arched a brow. "About your undeniable chemistry with Victoria? Or is there another scandal I should brace for?"

Nathan’s jaw clenched. "It’s not what it looks like."

"Isn’t it always?" She crossed her arms. "Get to the point, Nathan. I’m busy."

He stepped closer, the scent of his cologne—dark, woodsy, infuriatingly familiar—wrapping around her. "Someone’s trying to sabotage us," he murmured. "And I think I know who."

Evelyn stilled. "Who?"

Nathan’s lips curved into a humorless smile. "The same person who’s been pulling strings since the beginning. The one who stands to gain the most from tearing us apart."

A chill slithered down her spine.

Victoria.

But before she could respond, Nathan’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "We’re out of time."

Evelyn frowned. "What does that mean?"

Nathan pocketed his phone and met her gaze. "It means the game just changed. And if we don’t act fast, we’ll both lose."

The air between them crackled with tension, the unspoken question hanging heavy:

Who do you trust?

And for the first time in months, Evelyn wasn’t sure of the answer.

Well, well, well. The idiot just blew up his own grand scheme. I would pay good money to see the look on his face when he realizes he single-handedly ruined everything. Priceless.

Evelyn watched the live broadcast with dark amusement. Not only had Oliver exposed his own vile nature, but he’d also dragged Ava and her daughter into the mud, utterly destroying their reputations in one fell swoop.

"Strike fast, strike hard. I always knew that mother-daughter duo didn’t deserve to be part of Lucas’s family. Now, with this scandal breaking, even if Lucas chooses to cut them off completely, they won’t have a leg to stand on when it comes to guilt-tripping him," Marcus said, arms crossed.

Vivian nodded in agreement. "After everything Lucas has done for them, and this is how they repay him? Heartless doesn’t even begin to cover it."

"Once Lucas finally shakes them off, Beatrice can finally break free from Oliver too. A happy ending for both of them!" Vivian Moore clapped her hands together, grinning.

Daniel Wright gave a slow nod. "That engagement is as good as dead."

The Holloway family needed Beatrice for a political marriage, but there was no way they’d tie themselves to someone who brought this level of disgrace.

With this turn of events…

The group immediately dissolved into hushed gossip.

"Do you think they’ll switch the groom?" Vivian Grant whispered, eyes gleaming.

"Wouldn’t be surprised. They’re all victims here," Marcus Prescott agreed instantly.

"What? My poor girl just got out of one mess, and now she’s getting thrown into another?" Vivian Moore gasped dramatically.

"Even though Oliver just exposed some truths, you know people will still whisper. Rumors spread like wildfire," Daniel pointed out. "Besides, the engagement was arranged by the elders. There’s still room for… adjustments."

No way. Does this mean Lucas gets everything? Not only does he reclaim his inheritance, but he might just walk away with a wife too? Oliver and that scheming pair might as well have gift-wrapped his future for him.

As absurd as it sounded, Nathan didn’t deny the possibility. It was… disturbingly plausible.

After all, while the marriage alliance wasn’t about love, it was about securing ties between the families. There were multiple joint ventures waiting in the wings, all hinging on this union.

The group’s imaginations ran wild. The situation had reached its climax—there was nothing left to worry about.

Until—

A sudden uproar erupted from Ava’s side of the room.

With a surge of adrenaline she didn’t know she possessed, Penelope wrenched herself free from the bodyguard’s grip, her breath ragged. “No! This can’t be happening!” she shrieked, her voice cracking. “My daughter would never—never—be involved with… No, no, this is impossible!”

At that moment, Penelope’s composure shattered. She lunged at Lydia, her manicured nails clawing the air. “You! Did you orchestrate this? Was this your sick game?”

The guests exchanged uneasy glances. Penelope’s erratic behavior was unsettling, to say the least.

Even Luna was stunned. She couldn’t fathom why her mother was reacting this way. Sure, she had kept her relationship with Caleb a secret, but would that really drive her mother to madness? Or was it deeper than that? Did Penelope despise Caleb simply because he was Lydia’s son? Was her hatred for Lydia so consuming that she couldn’t bear the thought of their families entwined?

But it was too late now. Caleb had already exposed everything.

Lydia barely flinched at Penelope’s outburst. She had half a mind to have her thrown out—after all, Lucas probably didn’t want his mother making a scene like this. As for Penelope’s schemes against Lucas and Beatrice, both families would ensure she paid dearly.

Before Lydia could signal the security, however, Penelope froze. Her body trembled violently, as if seized by an unseen terror. The sudden silence was eerie.

Something was undeniably wrong with Penelope. It was as if she were trapped in some kind of waking nightmare.

Meanwhile, on the massive screen, Lucas flashed Caleb a knowing smile. “Thanks for playing along. You’ve just helped Beatrice and me clear our names.”

Caleb’s face paled. “What… did you say?”

Lucas pulled out his supposedly waterlogged phone and ended the video call.

Caleb’s expression twisted in horror.

“When you realized there were no surveillance cameras, did it ever occur to you that someone might be recording on their phone?” Lucas taunted. “Or did you actually believe my phone was ruined? Caleb, you really are painfully naive.”

“You—you tricked me!” Caleb sputtered, his voice strangled.

“Go see for yourself.”

Panic surged through Caleb. The old saying—pride comes before a fall—had never felt more real. One moment, he had been gloating, convinced of his victory. The next, he was plummeting from the heights of his arrogance. Without another word, he bolted toward the ballroom, his mind racing.

The wind howled around him, each gust like a slap to his face.

Desperate, he scrambled for a way to salvage the situation. Maybe he could spin this. Maybe there was still a chance—

But the moment he stepped into the ballroom, the weight of hundreds of scornful stares crushed him. The air thickened with disdain.

There was no coming back from this.

His face twisted through a series of emotions—confusion, humiliation, rage—before finally settling into sheer terror.

That expression could win an Oscar, Evelyn thought wryly.

She wasn’t the only one who noticed. The entertainment reporters, originally paid by Caleb Moore to cover the scandal, were practically salivating. They had come for a story, but never expected the mastermind himself to become the headline. Professionals to the core, they couldn’t resist capturing this explosive moment.

A camera flash went off.

Caleb snapped out of his daze. "Who the hell is taking pictures?!" he roared, his voice cracking with fury.

The crowd tittered. After all, hadn’t he orchestrated this entire mess? He’d tried to trap his cousin and fiancée, only to be caught in his own web. Poetic justice, they whispered.

The hushed laughter crashed over Caleb like a tidal wave. He glanced at his companions—Penelope Collins looked like a ghost, her spirit long fled, while Luna Morgan glared at him with accusing eyes.

Then his gaze landed on Beatrice Holloway, standing regally on the stage above them all.

"You scheming witch!" Caleb snarled, lunging toward her.

People moved to stop him, but to everyone’s shock, the usually composed Beatrice didn’t retreat. Instead, she charged at him.

Caleb faltered mid-step, stunned by her sudden aggression.

Beatrice didn’t hesitate. Her palm cracked across his cheek with a sound so sharp it silenced the room.

For a man used to being struck only by his mother or Lucas Thornton, this was unthinkable. Caleb’s eyes blazed, but before he could react, Beatrice struck again—and again—each slap landing with rhythmic precision.

"Beatrice is hitting someone?" Vivian Grant gasped.

"Damn, when she snaps, she snaps," Marcus Prescott muttered, impressed.

"I’ve never seen this side of her," Vivian Moore sighed.

"Desperation," Daniel Wright observed dryly.

Good. Hit him harder. Evelyn clenched her fists. Scum like him deserves it. As long as it doesn’t kill him, keep going.

###Chapter 282 Whatever Beatrice Desires

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. The weight of last night’s argument with Nathan Blackwood still pressed heavily on her chest.

Her phone buzzed—Victoria Hayes, her ever-persistent secretary, had sent another message.

"Evelyn, the press is already speculating about your absence from the premiere. We need damage control."

Evelyn tossed the phone aside. Damage control. As if her personal life was just another PR crisis to manage.

Across town, Nathan stood in his office, staring blankly at the city skyline. His assistant, Lillian Graves, hovered near the door, hesitant.

"Mr. Blackwood, your sister, Sophia, called. She said it’s urgent."

Nathan clenched his jaw. Sophia had been meddling in his affairs again, no doubt.

"Tell her I’ll call her later."

Lillian hesitated. "She mentioned… Evelyn."

Nathan’s grip tightened on his glass. The whiskey inside trembled.

Meanwhile, at a chic café downtown, Serena Whitmore, Evelyn’s agent, tapped her manicured nails against the table. Across from her sat Preston Whitmore, the director of Evelyn’s latest film.

"Preston, we need to address this before it spirals," Serena said, her voice low but urgent.

Preston sighed. "The studio’s breathing down my neck. If Evelyn doesn’t show up to the reshoots, they’ll replace her."

Serena’s phone lit up with a message from Evelyn: "I need space."

She groaned. Space was a luxury they couldn’t afford.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn’s gaze drifted to the framed photo on her nightstand—her and Nathan, laughing under the stars at last year’s gala. A lifetime ago.

A knock at the door startled her. She wasn’t expecting anyone.

Through the peephole, she saw Nathan, his expression unreadable.

Her breath hitched.

He knocked again, firmer this time.

"Evelyn. We need to talk."

Her fingers hovered over the lock. One twist, and everything would change.

Outside, Nathan waited, his heart pounding.

The door remained closed.

The slap came out of nowhere, catching Caleb completely off guard. For a moment, he stood frozen, his cheek stinging from the impact. Of course, a man like him would never allow a woman to strike him without retaliation.

But before he could raise his hand, his wrist was seized in a vice-like grip. Caleb turned sharply, only to find himself staring into the cold, furious eyes of Lucas, who had followed him silently.

Rage burned through Caleb like wildfire. He wanted nothing more than to tear Lucas apart right then and there. "So protective of her, aren't you?" he sneered, his voice dripping with venom. "It's obvious now—you two have been sneaking around behind my back. Those words I said earlier? Lies. The truth is, you've been lusting after my fiancée, and she’s been more than willing. Disgusting."

Lucas hadn’t expected Caleb to sink this low. The sheer audacity of his accusations nearly made him laugh. "Do you honestly think anyone believes your delusions?"

Caleb didn’t care. He was determined to drag them both down with him.

"You dare deny it? I know you—"

Another slap cut him off mid-sentence.

This time, the force sent Caleb sprawling to the ground. His cheek throbbed as he clutched it, dazed. When his vision cleared, he found himself staring up at the woman who had struck him—Luna.

"Drugging. Scheming. Framing innocent people. And now throwing a tantrum like a spoiled child?" Luna’s voice was eerily calm, but her eyes held a deep, unspoken pain. She had always known her son was flawed, but she never imagined he could be this rotten.

At that moment, something in Caleb snapped. The resentment he had harbored toward his mother twisted into something darker—something vicious.

She had seen the video. She knew the truth. And yet, instead of defending him, she stood there, siding with Lucas. If she had just supported him, he could have turned this entire situation around!

But no. Her betrayal cut deeper than any blade. "Mother," he spat, his voice trembling with fury. "How could you do this to me?"

Luna couldn’t bear to meet her son’s hate-filled gaze. Steeling herself, she turned to address the gathered crowd.

"My deepest apologies for this disgraceful spectacle," she announced, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "The fault lies with me—I failed to raise my son properly, allowing him to become this kind of man. Effective immediately, the engagement between Caleb Moore and Beatrice Holloway is officially canceled."

At those words, Beatrice finally exhaled, relief flooding through her.

Though many had expected this outcome, the abruptness still sent shockwaves through the room. The wedding had been confirmed barely an hour ago—now, it was over before it even began.

The Holloway and Bennett families exchanged uneasy glances. While they had anticipated this, the reality was far more brutal than they imagined.

The alliance between the two families?

At that moment, Claudia had already turned to apologize to Beatrice. "You're a wonderful young woman, and it's our family, the Bennetts, who owe you. As restitution, if your family still wishes to forge an alliance through marriage, you may choose any eligible bachelor from our family."

Beatrice froze, causing Lucas to stiffen instantly. His gaze snapped toward her, while the rest of the two families erupted in quiet excitement.

As expected of Mrs. Claudia. Bold enough to replace Beatrice’s fiancé on the spot! Evelyn thought.

The room buzzed with murmurs. Though the Bennetts had many sons, wasn’t Lucas the most prominent candidate? Had their speculations been right all along?

Claudia continued solemnly, "Of course, you may also select the heir."

The moment the words left her lips, the entire gathering erupted.

Unconsciously, Beatrice lifted her eyes to Lucas—only to be caught off guard when their gazes locked.

The Holloways gasped in excitement. "The heir?"

The Holloway family had never seriously considered pursuing the heir—not because they were unworthy, but because they understood their daughter’s nature. Beatrice thrived in her own world, chasing her passions, and thus, she was unlikely to be a conventional matriarch.

The head of any prestigious family couldn’t afford to neglect business affairs. Even if she didn’t work directly in the company, her role in social engagements was crucial. Yet Beatrice refused to conform to such expectations. That was why she had been perfectly matched with Caleb, who also had no interest in inheriting the family empire. They had been equals—neither overshadowing nor yielding to the other.

Now, Claudia’s offer implied a compromise. Beatrice could retain her freedom, and the Bennetts were willing to grant her this position. This was their way of making amends.

The Holloways found themselves at a loss. How could they demand justice for their daughter’s ordeal when the apology had been delivered with such sincerity?

Claudia spoke again, firm and direct. "Yes. And with this, we formally announce the selection of the Bennett family’s future heir." She exchanged nods with several Bennett elders before gesturing toward Lucas. "Lucas, step forward."

Lucas took a single, deliberate step forward.

Claudia declared, "From this moment onward, Lucas will gradually assume my responsibilities. I trust you will all continue to support our family in the years to come."

Just moments ago, the room had been thick with tension. Now, in an instant, the atmosphere had shifted—transforming into an official succession announcement. And with that, Caleb lost everything.

Holy hell, is this really happening? Lucas actually landed this? My emotions are all over the place—it’s like watching your favorite ship finally set sail! I’d pay to see Caleb’s face right now. Imagine going for gold and ending up with nothing.

Evelyn couldn't help but glance at Caleb, curious about his reaction. But before she could get a proper look, Caleb suddenly lunged forward, his voice cracking with betrayal.

"Mom! How could you be so unfair? Am I not your son? Is he the one you favor now? You're even trying to set them up! How could you do this to me?"

This time, Caleb was truly furious—his eyes burned red with anger. He could accept the broken engagement. He could even swallow the loss of his position as heir. But the thought of what was rightfully his being handed over to Lucas? That was unbearable.

At that moment, Luna saw her chance. She had been drowning in despair, but now, she seized the opportunity with desperate excitement.

"I knew it! I knew it! You must have found out about their secret affair and are just covering for them now! So I wasn’t lying—I’ve seen them together, acting suspiciously! I’m a witness!"

Was this woman truly so determined to ruin her own brother? Or was she simply too stubborn to admit defeat?

Nathan thought it was the latter—some people refused to face reality until it crushed them completely.

"Luna, do you have the memory of a goldfish?" Lucas snapped, his voice sharp with warning. "Or have you already forgotten that Caleb admitted you two drugged and framed them?"

Some people were like this—acting as if recent events never happened, stirring up chaos for no reason.

"Why else would she let them get engaged? Who just switches partners like that? Who would believe there’s nothing shady going on?"

Luna was exactly like those vile internet trolls—hiding behind anonymity, spreading baseless rumors with just enough plausibility to cause damage.

But everyone here knew better. She was nothing more than a nuisance.

Margaret stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. "We haven’t even begun to address what you and your mother have done. You’d do well to stay quiet." She paused, then added, "And I wasn’t  speaking. Who said I was playing matchmaker? I was simply giving Beatrice the right to choose."

As she spoke, Margaret turned her gaze toward Beatrice, who stood with a slight frown.

"This is merely a suggestion. If you don’t wish to marry into the Blackwood family, I’d be honored to take you as my goddaughter. But if you truly can’t bear any connection to us anymore, I’ll ensure you’re compensated in other ways."

Margaret had never believed that forcing a new relationship onto a wounded woman was true compensation. Real reparation meant giving her the power to decide her own future.

Even as a goddaughter, Beatrice could maintain ties between their families. If that wasn’t enough, there were other options.

In the end, whatever Beatrice desired, the Blackwoods would accept.

###Chapter 283 I Want To Be Your Goddaughter

The tension in the penthouse was palpable as Evelyn Sinclair stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tightening around the stem of her wine glass. The city lights glittered below, but her mind was far from the view.

Nathan Blackwood watched her from across the room, his dark eyes unreadable. "You're overthinking again," he murmured, his voice low and smooth.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "It's not overthinking when the entire industry is waiting for us to fail."

Victoria Hayes, Nathan's sharp-tongued secretary, chose that moment to stride in, her heels clicking against the marble floor. "The press has caught wind of the merger," she announced, her tone clipped. "They're already spinning it as a desperate move."

Serena Whitmore, Evelyn's ever-loyal agent, scoffed. "Desperate? Please. This is strategic genius."

Nathan's lips curved into a smirk. "Let them talk. By the time we're done, they'll be scrambling to rewrite their narratives."

Evelyn turned to face them, her emerald eyes flashing with determination. "Then we make sure there's no room for doubt. We go bigger than they expect."

Victoria arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Bigger how?"

A slow, knowing smile spread across Evelyn's face. "We don't just announce the merger. We announce the project that will redefine the industry."

Nathan's gaze locked onto hers, a spark of challenge igniting between them. "You're talking about The Obsidian Crown."

Evelyn nodded. "Exactly. We give them something they can't ignore."

Serena clapped her hands together. "Oh, I love this. The media will lose their minds."

Victoria, ever the skeptic, crossed her arms. "And if it backfires?"

Nathan stepped forward, his presence commanding. "Then we handle it. But it won't."

Evelyn met his gaze, the unspoken understanding between them stronger than ever. They had faced worse—betrayals, scandals, ruthless competitors. This was just another battle.

And they always won.

Lydia's proposal took everyone by surprise—especially Evelyn.

The older woman's suggestion carried profound respect, a gesture so unexpected it made Evelyn's breath catch. Just moments ago, she had been drowning in distress, weighed down by the aftermath of the scandal. Worse still, she suspected Lucas might harbor feelings for her…

But now, with Lydia’s words, it was as if chains had shattered around her. A new path unfurled before her, bright with possibility.

Lydia tilted her head, amusement dancing in her eyes. "So, which will it be? Or do you need more time to decide?"

She owed this woman a debt. Her son had caused pain, and she intended to make amends.

The Blackwoods and the Prescotts didn’t object—though they clearly preferred the stability of a marriage alliance. Subtle glances from the Prescotts nudged Evelyn in that direction.

The onlookers whispered, marveling at how Evelyn had turned disaster into fortune.

Small clusters of guests began placing bets on her choice.

Vivian leaned toward Nathan, mischief glinting in her gaze. "What do you think she’ll pick?"

Nathan shrugged. "No idea."

Vivian’s lips curved. "Let’s make it interesting. You choose one option, I’ll take the other. Whoever wins gets to demand a favor from the loser."

Hah! I already know she’ll pick goddaughter. Victory is mine! Her mind raced with possibilities. What should I make Nathan do?

Nathan didn’t know her scheming thoughts, but his ears burned pink anyway.

"Fine," he said. "I’ll take the marriage alliance."

Vivian nearly squealed. "Perfect! Then I’ll take goddaughter."

Watching her grin like a cat with cream, Nathan couldn’t help but smile. Their tablemates overheard and quickly joined the wager.

Roland frowned. "I wonder what Lucas will think."

"He likes—" Daniel started, but Roland cut him off.

"Don’t joke about that."

Vivian bit her lip to keep from laughing.

His silent devotion had been so carefully concealed that even his closest friends remained unaware. In truth, his restraint was so complete that others began misinterpreting his kindness as mere formality. Poor Lucas. Had his circle known the truth, they might have schemed to unite the pair long ago.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, Beatrice spoke. Hesitation wasn’t in her nature. Before, circumstances had bound her—but now, the choice was hers.

"Mrs. Eleanor, I—"

"Beatrice!" Lucas couldn’t suppress the outburst any longer.

For years, he’d held back out of deference to his aunt’s generosity. But Caleb’s marital blunder was entirely his own making. If Lucas hesitated now, he’d regret it forever. A decade of longing had led to this moment—his chance to fight for the woman who’d unknowingly held his heart.

This was his closest brush with claiming the love he’d nurtured in secret.

As Lucas drew breath to speak, Beatrice’s voice cut through the tension. "My decision is made."

Her frosty tone froze him mid-sentence, though he hadn’t even posed the question.

She understood.

And she’d chosen.

He had no right to object.

Their eyes met, and in that instant, he knew.

Lucas fell silent, his devastation more profound than when he’d been framed months prior. The light drained from his expression, leaving hollow resignation.

The exchange was too direct to suggest hidden meanings. The gathered guests merely buzzed with curiosity—what path would the renowned jewelry designer select?

Eleanor herself seemed startled by Beatrice’s swift resolution.

"I wish to become your goddaughter," Beatrice declared without preamble.

Gasps rippled through the room.

Every soul present had expected her to choose marriage. Their years of friendship, their matching intellects and temperaments—where would Beatrice find a more suitable match than Lucas Thornton?

The Blackwoods mourned the lost opportunity, yet respected her autonomy. The smaller faction remained oblivious, still convinced no romance existed between the pair.

Across the room, Evelyn’s lips curved in triumph as she locked eyes with Nathan.

"Congratulations," Nathan murmured, amusement dancing in his gaze. "Name your prize."

Evelyn tapped a finger against her champagne flute. "I’ll collect when inspiration strikes."

The hum of speculation crescendoed as Lucas turned toward the terrace, his broad shoulders rigid with unspoken grief. Beatrice watched him go, her expression unreadable.

Eleanor reached for her hand. "Are you certain, my dear?"

The question hung between them—not just about goddaughters or weddings, but about the life Beatrice was choosing to walk away from.

Beatrice’s answer came swift as a blade.

"Some paths aren’t meant to intertwine."

And with those words, the gilded doors of possibility slammed shut.

"Alright."

Formalizing an adoptive relationship required more than a casual agreement. They needed to select an auspicious date for the ceremony.

Once the arrangements were settled, Lydia turned her attention to the three troublemakers.

"Caleb, do you understand what you've done wrong?"

Caleb's face darkened as he watched how warmly his adversaries were being treated. He shot up from his seat. "Admit my mistake? You're treating Lucas like your own son and Beatrice like your goddaughter, but you won't even look at me! How generous of you. Huh? You turn a blind eye to everything I’ve endured, and now you think I’m beneath you. Fine. I don’t need you anymore. Today, I’m cutting all ties with you. Go ahead—be their mother!"

His father, startled, leaped to his feet. "How dare you speak to your mother like that? You’re in the wrong. Apologize now!"

"Are you threatening me?" Lydia’s heart ached at her son’s venomous words, but she kept her composure, her expression unreadable.

Caleb was furious, his pride refusing to bend. He wanted to challenge her, to see who would break first.

"If this is truly your decision, I won’t stop you," Lydia said calmly. She wasn’t one to be intimidated. The moment she learned of Caleb’s downfall, she knew drastic measures were necessary.

Deep down, she still hoped to save him. By severing their ties and cutting off his financial support, she prayed hardship would force him to grow. For his sake, she was willing to make this painful choice.

"You—you—" Caleb hadn’t expected her to agree. His vision blurred with rage, his legs nearly giving out beneath him.

"How cruel can you be?" Luna snapped, unable to hide her resentment. "Are you even his real mother?"

Her words drew muffled laughter from the onlookers.

Surprisingly, everyone seemed to share the same thought.


###Chapter 284: Temptation

The penthouse suite smelled of expensive champagne and fresh roses. Evelyn Sinclair traced her fingers along the rim of her crystal glass, watching the golden liquid swirl. Across from her, Nathan Blackwood lounged on the velvet couch, his tailored suit accentuating every hard line of his body.

"You're staring," he murmured, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine.

Evelyn took a deliberate sip of her drink. "I was just wondering how many women have fallen for that look."

Nathan's lips curved into that infuriatingly confident smirk. "Enough to know it works."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Outside, the city lights glittered like scattered diamonds against the night sky. The penthouse was too quiet, too intimate—dangerous territory for two people who shouldn't be alone together.

Evelyn set her glass down with a sharp click. "We should discuss the merger terms."

Nathan stretched his arms along the back of the couch, the movement pulling his shirt taut across his chest. "Business can wait."

Her pulse jumped. Damn him. Damn this attraction that refused to die no matter how many times she told herself to walk away.

A notification buzzed on her phone. Victoria Hayes's name flashed on the screen with a message that made Evelyn's stomach twist: I know where you are. Careful, Evelyn. You're playing with fire.

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "Problem?"

Evelyn locked her phone with forced calm. "Just work." She stood abruptly, needing distance. "I should go."

In one fluid motion, Nathan was on his feet, blocking her path. His hand caught her wrist, warm and unyielding. "Running away again?"

She could feel his breath against her lips. Every rational thought screamed at her to leave, but her body betrayed her, leaning infinitesimally closer.

Then the doorbell rang.

The spell shattered. Evelyn jerked back as Serena Whitmore's voice carried through the intercom: "Evelyn? We have an emergency with the Milan account."

Nathan's jaw tightened, but he stepped aside. "Duty calls."

Evelyn straightened her dress, her hands trembling slightly. This was why she couldn't let herself fall—there were too many players in this game, and someone always got burned.

As she reached the door, Nathan's voice stopped her: "This isn't over."

She didn't turn around. She couldn't. Because part of her feared he was right.

Outside, the elevator doors closed with a hushed whisper, leaving behind the scent of roses, champagne, and promises better left unspoken.

This time, Luna was genuinely terrified. "Mom, you—"

"Shut up! Don't say another word. Let's go—we're leaving this place now." Penelope's voice shook with urgency as she gripped Luna's arm, yanking her to her feet.

"Luna!"

Though reluctant, Luna found herself dragged forward by her mother's iron grip.

"Wait just a minute!" Lydia's sharp voice cut through the tension. "Who said you could walk away without explaining yourselves?"

"That is my son!" Penelope whirled around, her eyes blazing. "How I deal with him is my business, just like how you handle Caleb is none of ours!"

A bitter laugh escaped Lydia. "We are not the same. When Caleb made mistakes, I corrected him. But Lucas? What has he done to deserve this? And let’s not forget—your actions have dragged Ms. Holloway into this mess. Do you really think you can just walk away? Oliver already said you were behind this! My dear sister-in-law, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?"

The truth was, Lydia’s heart ached for Lucas. She couldn’t comprehend how a mother could torment her own child to this extent.

Whispers erupted through the crowd. Many knew of Penelope’s history with Lucas in the Bennett family—how the trauma of a difficult birth and her husband’s sudden death had twisted her mind. Her way of coping? Inflicting pain on her son, feeding off his suffering.

But this time, she had crossed a line.

Not only had she sought to ruin Lucas’s reputation, but she had also tried to destroy his future.

She was sick. She needed help—professional help.

Lucas, meanwhile, was still reeling from the silent rejection of the woman he secretly loved. As for his mother and sister’s latest scheme? He couldn’t bring himself to care. It was the same old story, and he had long since grown numb to it.

Penelope clearly had no intention of explaining herself. Her glare burned into Lydia. "You want to pursue this? Fine. I’m his mother, and she is his sister. If you have a problem, take it up with him."

The sheer audacity. She was guilt-tripping them again.

Legally, this was a nightmare. No crime had technically been committed yet, and it was a family matter. The police wouldn’t touch it.

"So you’re refusing to take responsibility," Lydia said coldly.

Just then, a voice sliced through the tension.

"Of course they’ll take responsibility—but it’s not as dire as you think."

A man strode into the grand hall, his presence commanding immediate attention.

Before Evelyn could ask, Nathan leaned in and murmured, "Victor Reed."

Fresh off an international business trip, Victor Reed had barely stepped foot back in the country when he received a frantic message from his daughter, Luna. She claimed they were being held against their will by the Bennett family. Without hesitation, he rushed to the scene, simultaneously ordering his people to dig into the details of the situation.

Victor was nothing if not cunning. "This seems to be a misunderstanding," he said smoothly.

"Misunderstanding?" scoffed a Bennett family member. "Are you suggesting the dozens of witnesses are all mistaken? Or are you simply unaware of what your daughter has done?"

Victor chuckled, unfazed. "Actually, Luna and Caleb have been in a relationship for some time now. Caleb, pressured by Penelope, didn’t dare refuse the engagement. My wife couldn’t bear to see the young lovers torn apart, so she orchestrated this little scheme. It was also meant to teach our son a lesson—he’s been rather rebellious lately. We never intended for things to escalate this far."

Unbelievable. The audacity of this man knew no bounds. Like father, like daughter—both masters of twisting the truth to suit their narrative.

Nathan Blackwood, however, narrowed his eyes. Something about Victor’s explanation didn’t sit right with him.

Sure enough, Victor continued, "They were wrong, and I’ll make sure they apologize. But here’s my proposal: Luna will never sever ties with Lucas. Why not strengthen that bond instead? Let’s put this ugliness behind us. Since Caleb and Luna are clearly in love, why not announce their engagement today? From now on, we’ll be one big, happy family. No conflict is too great to resolve."

The room fell into stunned silence. Though everyone had just witnessed the scandal unfold, Victor’s words had successfully shifted the narrative. Some members of the Bennett family even found themselves considering the idea.

The Reeds weren’t particularly influential—their recent rise in status was largely due to Lucas. Now, they were shamelessly angling to marry their daughter into the Bennett family. The sheer audacity of their scheme was almost impressive.

Luna and Beatrice were worlds apart. Under normal circumstances, such a match would have been unthinkable. Yet, Victor’s smooth-tongued explanation had somehow made it seem plausible.

If the two were already involved, then marriage would salvage their reputations. Over time, the scandal would fade, and the truth would be buried. Some of the Bennetts were even nodding in approval.

Good grief. Shamelessness truly had no limits. Victor’s plan was airtight. He knew his daughter’s reputation was already in tatters, and he didn’t even like Caleb. But if Luna married into the Bennett family and bore Caleb’s child, that child would be Penelope’s grandchild—a potential heir. And the Reeds, as the maternal grandparents, would rise in status accordingly.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. This man is playing the long game.

And if Luna married Caleb, the Reeds would immediately shift their focus to Lucas. They would come after him with even more ruthlessness than before.

Victor turned to Penelope, who still looked unconvinced. "My daughter is young," he said pointedly. "Caleb is her first love. I won’t stand by and let her be used or discarded like some plaything."

Was that a veiled threat? The mastermind behind this was supposedly Penelope, but was it really Caleb exploiting his mother’s influence instead?

The tension in the room was palpable. The air thickened as Sergio's ultimatum hung between them, sharp as a blade. His cunning plan was clear—if Lydia refused to comply, Oliver would bear the full brunt of the consequences.

Lydia's expression darkened, her fingers tightening around the edge of the table. She understood the game being played. Unless she severed all ties with Oliver, Ruby would worm her way into their lives, a viper in their midst. And worse—Nathan was already piecing together the same conclusion.

Sergio gave Ruby a subtle nod. She hesitated only a moment before lifting her chin. What did she have left to lose? Her reputation was already in tatters. Marrying Oliver might be her only way forward. She smirked inwardly. Lydia would never abandon Oliver, not truly. And once she was in, she and Damien could dismantle Lucas and Beatrice’s influence, piece by piece.

Oliver, however, was frozen in shock. His mind raced. Marriage? To Ruby? No. Absolutely not. He’d indulged in her company, yes, but that was as far as it went. He refused to let his life be dictated by Sergio’s threats. His jaw clenched—he wouldn’t stand for this.

But before he could voice his protest, a furious cry shattered the silence.

"No!"

The room stilled. All eyes snapped to Ava, who stood trembling with barely contained rage. Her voice was raw, desperate. "They cannot be together!"

The crowd exchanged bewildered glances. Ava’s reaction was too extreme, too personal. It was almost as if—

A slow realization crept in.

Wait…

No. It couldn’t be that cliché, could it?

But the pieces were there. And if they fit…

Then this was far more twisted than anyone had imagined.

###Chapter 285 - The Shocking Truth About Caleb and Lucas

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse as she lounged on the plush velvet sofa, her phone clutched tightly in her hand. The screen displayed the latest headline from Celebrity Pulse:

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving Hotel with Mystery Woman—Who Is She?"

Evelyn’s perfectly manicured nails tapped against the glass screen, her lips curling into a smirk. Oh, Nathan, you never disappoint.

The accompanying photo was grainy but unmistakable—Nathan, his dark hair tousled, his signature smirk in place, stepping out of the Luxe Grand with a woman whose face was conveniently obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. The caption speculated wildly: Is this the end of his rumored reconciliation with Evelyn Sinclair?

A soft chuckle escaped her. As if.

She scrolled further, absorbing every salacious detail. The article claimed the mystery woman was none other than Victoria Hayes, his sharp-tongued secretary—his supposed confidante turned lover. Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. Victoria? Really?

The thought was almost laughable. Victoria had always been more of a nuisance than a threat, her icy professionalism masking what Evelyn suspected was a desperate crush. But this? This was bold.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant.

Lillian: You’ve seen the news, I assume?

Evelyn: Oh, I’ve seen it. And I have questions.

Lillian: Shall I dig deeper?

Evelyn hesitated, then typed: No. Let’s see how far Nathan’s little game goes.

She tossed her phone aside and stood, pacing the length of the sunlit room. The media loved a scandal, and Nathan loved feeding them just enough to keep the world guessing. But this time, Evelyn wasn’t playing along.

Not yet.

Her gaze flicked to the framed photo on the mantel—her and Nathan at last year’s charity gala, his arm draped possessively around her waist, her smile razor-sharp. Partners in crime, the tabloids had called them. The power couple of the decade.

And they weren’t wrong.

But power came with games, and games came with risks.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed again—another notification. This time, it was a direct message from an anonymous account.

Unknown: You should ask Nathan about his midnight meetings with Victoria. The ones at her apartment.

Her pulse quickened. Interesting.

She didn’t respond. Instead, she took a slow sip of her champagne, the bubbles fizzing against her tongue.

Let the games begin.

Not only did Evelyn find it strange, but even Nathan couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling about Penelope's reaction.

The Blackwood family had gradually mastered the art of gossip from Evelyn. The best kind of gossip had to be either outrageous or dramatic—preferably both.

At Evelyn's sudden exclamation, the Blackwoods couldn't help but dive into speculation.

Richard remarked, "Her reaction doesn’t seem like she thinks Caleb is unworthy of Luna."

Margaret mused, "Remember that soap opera we watched recently?"

"The mother who tried to tear apart the male lead and the second female lead?" Sophia’s cheeks flushed with excitement. "Honestly, Penelope looks like she’s about to burst into tears any second now..."

You two can’t be together… because you’re actually half-siblings sharing the same mother… Oh my god, what did I just uncover? So, Caleb and Lucas were switched at birth?

Evelyn’s inner revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

What had started as wild speculation was now confirmed by Evelyn herself. The expressions on the Blackwoods' faces were priceless—shock, disbelief, and morbid fascination.

While gossip was entertaining, the reality was undeniably cruel for those involved.

Nathan’s expression darkened instantly. This confirmed his suspicions.

All the suffering Lucas had endured over the years… had been nothing but a cruel twist of fate.

His sharp gaze locked onto Penelope, whose face had gone deathly pale.

People like her—no matter their reasons—were unforgivable for the pain they inflicted on children.

Evelyn was so engrossed in unraveling the truth that she didn’t notice the sudden shift in Nathan’s demeanor. But the others at the table felt the icy chill radiating from him and shivered.

"What’s wrong?" Daniel asked, startled.

"What else? He’s disgusted by the Winters family’s shamelessness," Vivian huffed. "But why is Mrs. Winters opposing her own husband? It’s obvious Victor is trying to secure a good future for their family and Luna. Luna seems willing. So why is Penelope acting like this?"

Vivian Grant tilted her head. "Are they playing good cop, bad cop?"

Marcus Prescott scoffed. "If that’s the case, then this woman’s acting skills are Oscar-worthy. She looks like she’s seen a ghost."

"Actually… it doesn’t look like disgust. More like fear." Daniel frowned, unable to resist voicing his observation.

The tension in the room thickened.

What had started as mere gossip had spiraled into something far darker.

And the truth… was more twisted than anyone could have imagined.

Nathan had already begun strategizing how to expose this scandal. He couldn't simply stand by and watch as events unfolded.

Meanwhile, Penelope was trapped in an impossible situation. Though her mind was fracturing under the pressure, she had to maintain composure in this crisis.

There was no way Caleb could marry Luna.

Yet Victor's expression had turned icy, and even Luna was starting to resent her own mother.

"Don't be unreasonable," Victor said sharply, shooting Penelope a disapproving glare. "I know you think our daughter is too young, but she’ll marry eventually. Wouldn’t it be better if she married into a family we know? At least we’d have peace of mind."

No, no, no! Penelope couldn’t afford to hesitate now. She was the only one who truly understood the gravity of the situation, yet she couldn’t speak the truth. How could she possibly admit that she had switched the two babies at birth? That Caleb was actually the eldest son of the Bennett family, making him Luna’s half-brother?

Evelyn, overhearing the whispers and Victor’s words, couldn’t help but scoff internally.

The Blackwood men’s expressions darkened further. Enough! This is beyond twisted.

The phrase "reaping what you sow" had never felt more apt.

Penelope could only shake her head desperately, her entire body trembling. "No, I can’t agree. Absolutely not! Victor, let’s go home. I’m exhausted. We need to leave."

"Mom, what’s wrong with you?" Luna pleaded, hoping her mother would snap out of it.

Victor, too, was baffled by Penelope’s resistance. But without a proper explanation, neither he nor Luna would back down.

Penelope would never dare confess her sins. And now that everyone knew about Caleb and Luna’s supposed engagement… Holy hell! Evelyn mentally recoiled. I don’t want to know the details. My worldview can’t take this. She quickly distracted herself before her thoughts spiraled further.

Even if Penelope were forced to speak now, she wouldn’t reveal the truth. And without it, her objections sounded weak—pathetic, even.

Hearing Evelyn’s silent judgment, the Blackwoods nodded in grim agreement. Victor wouldn’t let this opportunity slip away.

Nathan’s brows relaxed slightly. Victor was determined to push this marriage through. Penelope had trapped herself in a corner with no escape. All that remained was to wait for the right moment to strike.

Before the Reeds could even process the chaos, Caleb exploded.

He hadn’t expected Penelope to oppose the match, but it brought him no relief. The whispers around him, the mocking glances—they all ridiculed him. They sneered at his failure to win Beatrice’s heart, and now even a woman like Luna was being forced upon him.

The humiliation burned.

But the worst was yet to come.

Caleb Moore was practically choking on his own fury, his pride wounded beyond repair.
? What does that even mean? That Luna isn't worthy of me? If anything, she's the one who should be groveling at my feet! I should be the one rejecting her, not the other way around. How dare Penelope look down on me like this?

Normally, Penelope was all sweetness and light when it came to him, always singing his praises—how much more capable he was than Lucas, how much brighter his future. She'd even conspired with him against Lucas, whispering strategies in his ear like a trusted ally. But the moment her precious daughter entered the picture? Her true colors bled through. It was like she'd been playing him all along.

Neither Vivian nor Beatrice had ever given him the time of day, so their rejection didn’t sting half as much. But Penelope? The woman who’d once called him brilliant? Her sudden shift cut deeper than any insult.

“What’s the matter, Mrs. Collins?” Caleb sneered, deliberately dropping the familiar Aunt Penelope for something colder. “Do I suddenly not meet your standards?”

Oh, it’s not that she looks down on you, Evelyn Sinclair thought, biting back a laugh. She just realizes you’re too much of a snake for her daughter.

Watching Penelope flinch at Caleb’s venomous tone, Evelyn barely suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.

Typical. Every villain had their—

Bitch.

###Chapter 286: Mind Games and Revelations

The morning sunlight streamed through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she sipped her espresso, scrolling through her phone with practiced disinterest. That was, until a particular notification made her nearly choke on her drink.

"Victoria Hayes just posted a new story," murmured Lillian Graves, Evelyn's ever-efficient assistant, placing a fresh stack of scripts on the marble counter. "Shall I—"

"No need." Evelyn's manicured finger hovered over the screen. "Let's see what our dear secretary has to share today."

The video loaded, showing Victoria twirling in a designer dress outside Nathan Blackwood's corporate headquarters. The caption read: Late nights at the office never looked this good.

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone. "How... predictable."

Lillian cleared her throat. "Ms. Sinclair, your meeting with Preston Whitmore starts in—"

"Cancel it." Evelyn stood abruptly, her silk robe fluttering behind her. "I need to pay Nathan a visit."

Nathan's office smelled of sandalwood and power—a combination Evelyn had grown intimately familiar with over the past months. She didn't bother knocking.

"Nathan, darling," she purred, striding past his startled assistant. "We need to talk about your... staffing choices."

Nathan looked up from his documents, his storm-gray eyes unreadable. "Evelyn. To what do I owe this interruption?"

She dropped her phone onto his desk, Victoria's smug face frozen mid-laugh on the screen. "Care to explain why your secretary thinks she's auditioning for the role of Mrs. Blackwood?"

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw. "Victoria's social media habits aren't my concern."

"Really?" Evelyn leaned forward, bracing her hands on his desk. "Because last I checked, sleeping with the boss was company business."

The air between them crackled. Nathan's gaze dropped to her lips for a fraction of a second before he schooled his expression. "Jealousy doesn't suit you, Evelyn."

She straightened with a laugh. "Oh sweetheart, this isn't jealousy." Her smile turned razor-sharp. "This is me giving you fair warning—clean up your mess before I do it for you."

As she turned to leave, Nathan's voice stopped her at the door. "You forget—I don't respond well to threats."

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder, her eyes gleaming with challenge. "And you forget—I always follow through."

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Nathan alone with the echo of her perfume and the undeniable truth: Evelyn Sinclair never bluffed.

Somewhere across town, Victoria Hayes shivered despite the afternoon heat. The game was afoot—and the stakes had just gotten dangerously personal.

Karma always comes full circle. Who could have imagined that Penelope would weave such an intricate web of deception? At first, she might have reveled in the sweet taste of revenge, but she never anticipated her own children would become entangled in her schemes. Her grand design had crumbled into scandal, leaving her drowning in the unbearable weight of truth. Now, she had no choice but to clean up the mess—before her lies were exposed for all to see.

The Blackwood family quickly grasped the heart of the matter. Penelope’s vendetta was tied to the unthinkable—the switching of children.

Evelyn, however, had no time for idle gossip. She was far too entertained watching the drama unfold, her sharp tongue ready with biting commentary.

Caleb Moore glared at Penelope with barely restrained fury, but she refused to meet his gaze, her head bowed in shame. She wanted to whisk her daughter away, but no one was willing to play along. Trapped, she had no choice but to face him. Yet, even in desperation, her mind raced for an escape.

"No, my child. It's... it's that my daughter isn't worthy of you. I realize now there was never anything between you two. No relationship, no obligation. Everything I said earlier was just a scheme against Lucas."

As she spoke, her words gained a twisted logic, and to her own horror, she even began to laugh—a hollow, manic sound.

To onlookers, it was nothing short of bizarre. They knew Lucas had been manipulated, but no one expected Penelope to casually admit it—just to sever any perceived connection between Caleb and Luna.

She had lost all sense of priority.

Was she out of her mind?

Even Lucas, usually so detached, let out a bitter chuckle. In his mother’s eyes, it didn’t matter if he had been used.

She had lost it. The shock must have shattered her. As long as the truth remained buried, nothing else mattered. After all, this was a secret so dark, so damning—no one else knew. If she never acknowledged Caleb as her son, she could take this secret to her grave. That way, she wouldn’t have to face the consequences of her own selfishness.

Watching the manic glint in Penelope’s eyes, Evelyn nearly told her the truth: the secret wasn’t as safe as she thought. In fact, Evelyn was tempted to shout it from the rooftops.

If Penelope hadn’t been so obsessed with destroying Lucas, she wouldn’t have drawn so much attention. Evelyn wouldn’t have dug deeper. She wouldn’t have uncovered the truth.

The thought spurred Evelyn into action. Instinctively, she turned to Nathan.

Somehow, he had become her first choice for solving problems.

"Do you think Mrs. Reed seems... guilty?" she asked, testing the waters.

Nathan, however, had no patience for subtlety. "Actually," he said bluntly, "I’ve suspected for a while now."

Nathan's voice dropped to a whisper, sending chills down Evelyn's spine. "There might be something... unusual about Lucas and Caleb's pasts."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What do you mean?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "We need to dig deeper."

Evelyn could only manage a stunned, "Are you serious?"

Nathan gave a single, decisive nod, effortlessly stealing the scene. Evelyn was left reeling, her mind racing.

Good grief. Nathan's always ten steps ahead. Maybe I should just grab popcorn and watch the drama unfold.

Overhearing the exchange, the Blackwood family exchanged knowing glances. Behind Nathan's back, they rolled their eyes, stifling laughter at his theatrics.

Meanwhile, Caleb was blindsided by Penelope's reasoning. Though he suspected she was just making excuses—looking down on him—he had to admit her tact saved him a headache.

Caleb clenched his fists, forcing his temper down. Marrying Luna would be an insult, not just to himself, but to his pride. He had no intention of binding himself to her.

If he played along with Penelope's narrative, Victor wouldn’t dare pressure him.

"That’s rich," Caleb sneered, all former respect for Penelope evaporating. Her heart twisted, but she swallowed the pain. She was juggling too many fires, and failing at all of them.

"Mom, how could you say that about me?" Luna's voice cracked, her eyes burning with betrayal.

Penelope massaged her temples, the weight of the situation crushing her. She couldn’t explain the mess they were in—not without exposing everything. The frustration, the helplessness—it threatened to suffocate her.

Evelyn bit back a grin.

Hilarious. Luna doesn’t realize Penelope’s trying to save their dignity. If this plan works, even if the truth comes out later, it won’t destroy them. But no, these two idiots are determined to burn their last lifeline. Penelope must be losing her mind.

The Blackwoods were barely containing their amusement. Karma’s a bitch. These two are Penelope’s personal hell.

For Luna, all she heard was her mother declaring her unworthy of Caleb.

No daughter could stomach that. Why wasn’t she good enough for a spoiled brat like Caleb? Worse, she could see he didn’t want her either.

Penelope wasn’t helping—she was sabotaging her. As if she wanted Luna to fail.

The tension thickened, the air crackling with unspoken fury.

And Evelyn?

She was loving every second.

"Enough!" Penelope Collins snapped at Luna Morgan, her voice trembling with barely contained fury.

But Luna, undeterred, shot back, "You can't sabotage my relationship with Caleb just because of your grudge against Adriana! You're willing to ruin my happiness just to settle your own vendetta. How selfish can you be?"

Penelope never expected her daughter to lash out at her so publicly. Her face flushed with anger, yet she found herself speechless, the weight of the accusation pressing down on her.

The gathered crowd, initially there for the spectacle, exchanged shocked glances. While they knew tensions existed between Penelope and Adriana Laurent, none had suspected outright hatred.

Even Adriana looked taken aback, her brows knitting in confusion. Their disagreements had always stemmed from their children's affairs. Back when they were both part of the Bennett family, Adriana, as the heiress, handled external matters, while Penelope managed internal affairs. Their paths rarely crossed, and there had been no direct conflict. So why the animosity?

At that moment, Richard Bennett, who had been standing silently nearby, averted his gaze, discomfort flickering across his features. With Daniel Wright no longer alive, he couldn’t possibly bring up that old matter now.

The Blackwood family stiffened at the revelation, pieces clicking into place. This must have been the reason behind the child swap all those years ago.

Fortunately, Evelyn Sinclair’s sharp observation quickly clarified things.

Tsk, tsk, tsk. Back then, the Bennett family had arranged for Daniel to marry Adriana. But Penelope, desperate to have him for herself, drugged him and forced a union, destroying the engagement between him and Adriana. It had been a sudden, underhanded scheme, known only to those directly involved. Hence, Adriana—and everyone else—remained oblivious.

The Blackwoods exchanged stunned glances. What? This was about generational drama?

Evelyn’s thoughts continued. Daniel had been deeply in love with Adriana and vehemently opposed marrying Penelope. But under relentless family pressure, he eventually gave in. Meanwhile, Adriana ended up with Richard. Naturally, Daniel and Penelope’s marriage was fraught with tension, their relationship a battlefield of resentment.

The Blackwoods inwardly winced. No wonder there was so much conflict. Who could accept being trapped in a marriage built on deceit?

Evelyn’s musings didn’t stop there. Penelope had always believed Daniel still pined for Adriana. Since they both worked in the family business, their frequent interactions only fueled Penelope’s paranoia. She became convinced Adriana was seducing Daniel, and her hostility festered over the years, leading to…

The tension in the room thickened, the past’s shadows stretching into the present.
###Chapter 287 Everyone Is In Shock

The morning sun cast a golden glow over the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake. Beside her, Nathan Blackwood slept soundly, his dark lashes casting shadows over his sharp cheekbones. She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked—so unlike the ruthless businessman the world knew.

A soft chime from her phone interrupted the moment. Lillian Graves had sent a message: "The press conference is in two hours. The media is already swarming the venue."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Today was the day they would publicly announce their engagement, and the thought sent a thrill of anticipation—and dread—through her. The tabloids had been relentless, speculating about their relationship ever since Nathan had been spotted slipping a diamond ring onto her finger at an exclusive gala.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb him, and padded to the walk-in closet. Her fingers brushed over the sleek, emerald-green dress she had chosen for the occasion—elegant, sophisticated, and just daring enough to make a statement.

Nathan’s voice, rough with sleep, came from behind her. "Running away already?"

She turned to find him leaning against the doorframe, his bare chest still marked with faint traces of last night’s passion. A smirk played on his lips, but his eyes were serious.

"Never," she said, stepping closer. "Just preparing for battle."

He caught her wrist, pulling her against him. "You don’t need armor when you’re with me."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Says the man who once told me the corporate world is a warzone."

Nathan chuckled, but his grip tightened. "Then consider me your shield."

Before she could retort, his phone buzzed. Victoria Hayes’ name flashed on the screen. His expression darkened as he read the message.

Evelyn didn’t need to ask. Victoria had been a thorn in their side since the beginning—Nathan’s former secretary, who had once believed she would be the one standing beside him.

"Problem?" Evelyn asked lightly.

Nathan tossed the phone aside. "Nothing I can’t handle."

But Evelyn knew better. Victoria wasn’t one to back down quietly.

As if on cue, her own phone chimed again. This time, it was Preston Whitmore, the director of her upcoming film. "We need to talk. Urgently."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. What now?

Nathan’s gaze sharpened. "What is it?"

She forced a smile. "Just work. Nothing to worry about."

But the unease lingered. Today was supposed to be about their future—yet the past seemed determined to interfere.

As she turned back to the mirror, adjusting the neckline of her dress, she caught Nathan’s reflection watching her. His expression was unreadable, but the intensity in his eyes sent a shiver down her spine.

Whatever storm was coming, they would face it together.

But first, they had to survive the press.

The Blackwoods stood frozen, their expressions a mix of disbelief and pity for Lydia, who had clearly been wronged beyond measure.



Until this very moment, Lydia had no inkling that she had been the secret object of Nathan’s affection all those years. Even after Nathan married, he had never crossed any lines—never given her reason to doubt his loyalty.

Yet, Penelope had twisted everything, blaming every failure in her life on Lydia.

She should’ve looked in the mirror first.

Nathan hadn’t dwelled on these old wounds. But now, hearing the truth laid bare, he understood why Penelope had dared to orchestrate such an audacious scheme. There was precedent—she knew exactly how the Blackwoods would react under pressure. That was why she had the gall to frame Lucas and Beatrice.

But this time, fate wasn’t on her side.

Faced with her daughter’s defiance, Penelope panicked, resorting to the same manipulative tactics she’d used on Lucas for years.

"Are you leaving or not? If you stay, I swear I’ll disown you!"

If Luna had been paying attention, she might have noticed the wild desperation in her mother’s bloodshot eyes, the cracks in her composure. But Luna had been coddled her whole life—her mother’s threats only fueled her rebellion. She shoved Penelope back, hard.

Victor couldn’t take it anymore. He stepped forward, gripping Penelope’s arm with a warning hiss. "Enough. This isn’t the time for your theatrics."

He dismissed her without another glance, even as she pleaded with trembling lips. Turning to Lydia—whose expression remained unreadable—he forced a smile. "I assume you’ve given this matter careful thought. What are your terms for this marriage, Mrs. Lydia?"

Lydia’s lips curled into a cold smirk, but before she could speak, Caleb cut in.

"Did you not hear a word your wife just said? Nothing happened between me and your daughter. And now you’re still trying to trap me?" Caleb scoffed. "Marry her? Keep dreaming."

Victor, a man of status, flushed at being spoken to so bluntly by a younger man. But Caleb didn’t care for diplomacy—his usual tactics were useless against someone so brazen. He had no choice but to confront him head-on.

So he pushed his daughter forward instead.

Emboldened by her father’s nudge, Luna immediately switched gears.

"Caleb, how could you say that?" Luna, ever the aspiring actress, clutched her chest dramatically, painting him as the villain who’d callously ruined her.

But her performance…

If she auditions like this, she’ll be laughed out of the room.

The Blackwoods exchanged silent glances, agreeing with Evelyn’s unspoken critique—Luna’s theatrics were painfully unconvincing.

The realization hit Caleb like a ton of bricks. Luna had been scheming all along, using this opportunity to trap him.

"What nonsense! There's nothing between us! Where's your proof?" Caleb's voice was sharp with indignation. "Just because I called off my engagement doesn’t mean you have a shot at being my fiancée. You're Lucas's sister—even if there were a hundred of you, I wouldn’t be interested!" His denial was fierce, his words cutting through the tension like a blade.

No one had expected the confrontation to spiral like this. Just moments ago, the two had been united against Lucas and Beatrice. Now, they were tearing into each other with venomous accusations. The sheer absurdity of it all was enough to make anyone burst into laughter.

Evelyn watched the spectacle unfold, torn between amusement and disbelief. The situation was so ridiculous that words failed her. Instead, she turned her gaze toward Penelope, studying the older woman’s rapidly shifting expressions. The more she observed, the more ludicrous the scene became—Penelope looked as if she were on the verge of collapsing.

And who could blame her? Watching her own son and daughter publicly argue over an incestuous affair was beyond humiliating.

Yet, here they were, making fools of themselves—clowns who had failed in their schemes and were now burning every bridge behind them.

Luna hadn’t anticipated Caleb’s outright refusal to acknowledge their involvement. His cold rejection proved he had been using her all along. Furious, she yanked out her phone and snapped, "You want proof? Fine!"

Wait… is she really—? No way. She wouldn’t—

Evelyn’s thoughts trailed off, but the Blackwoods, who had been following the drama closely, were now on the edge of their seats.

What is it? Some scandalous text? Or… something worse?

Then, Luna swiped open her phone and pulled up a photo. The people closest to her gasped, their eyes widening in shock. Caleb’s face drained of color. In a flash, he lunged forward, trying to snatch the device from her hands.

Damn it! He hadn’t expected her to take pictures earlier—let alone keep them.

Victor, however, looked smugly satisfied. His daughter had outmaneuvered Caleb, and he couldn’t help but feel a twisted sense of pride. He was completely oblivious to the disaster he had just enabled.

Luna, triumphant, dodged Caleb’s grasp and held her phone high, showing the incriminating image to anyone who dared to look.

Evelyn and the Blackwoods—who knew the truth—could only stare in stunned silence.

Is this what they call… self-sabotage? Karma really does come full circle.

Penelope, who had been clinging to denial, finally saw the photo. Her last shred of composure shattered. A strangled sound escaped her throat before she doubled over, retching violently.

She couldn’t process it. Her world was collapsing around her, her beliefs crumbling into dust.

Then, with a guttural scream, she lost all control.

Her outburst sent a ripple of shock through the room. Everyone turned to stare at her, bewildered and horrified.

The Winters family had officially imploded—and there was no coming back from this.

The air crackled with tension as all eyes darted between Ava and her daughter. Did Ava despise Caleb so intensely? Or was her hatred directed at Luna?

The scene unfolded like a nightmare—Ava, as if possessed, lunged forward without warning. A sharp slap echoed through the room before she viciously snatched the phone from Luna’s trembling hands.

Is she trying to destroy the evidence?

Evelyn barely had time to process the thought when Ava froze, her gaze locked onto the screen. A wild, almost manic gleam flickered in her eyes.

"No… this isn't Caleb."

Ava suddenly burst into laughter, the sound unnervingly shrill. She jabbed a finger at the photo, her voice trembling with conviction. "This isn't Caleb! This is Lucas!"

Her words struck like lightning, sending shockwaves through the room. Even Evelyn and the Blackwoods, who knew most of the truth, were left speechless—let alone those directly involved.

Caleb looked utterly lost.

Luna gasped, her face draining of color.

Lucas’s fury surged like a storm, his chest tightening until he could barely breathe.

The photograph had been seen by many—a covert shot, capturing only Caleb’s bare torso and a sliver of his profile.

Caleb bore a striking resemblance to Lucas, nearly sixty percent alike. To an uninformed eye, the image could easily be mistaken for Lucas.

But the people here weren’t fools. They had witnessed the entire debacle unfold. Even those who thrived on gossip and scandal knew better than to believe something so absurd. Did Ava truly think they were that gullible?

"Mom!" Luna cried, her voice breaking with disbelief. She could no longer recognize the woman before her.

Ava clutched Luna’s shoulders, her grip desperate, her eyes wild. "I know you’ve been wronged. Your brother forced himself on you, and you’re too terrified to face it. That’s why you’re trying to pin everything on Caleb—but that’s not right! If Lucas hurt you, we call the police! Listen to me, darling. I won’t let him destroy you!"

Luna’s face twisted in horror. How is this not destroying me?

An affair between half-siblings was far more scandalous than anything involving Caleb.

The room erupted into chaos.

###Chapter 288 The Truth in Blood
Eavesdropping on Juicy Secrets

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Sinclair’s bedroom. She stretched lazily, her mind still half-asleep, when suddenly—bam!—a flood of thoughts that weren’t her own crashed into her consciousness.

"Oh my god, did Nathan really say that to Victoria last night?!"

Evelyn bolted upright, her heart pounding. That voice—sharp, gossipy, unmistakably Victoria Hayes’—wasn’t coming from outside. It was inside her head.

She clutched her temples, trying to make sense of it. Ever since that strange incident at the gala last week, she’d been catching fragments of other people’s thoughts. Mostly useless chatter—until now.

"If Evelyn finds out Nathan only proposed because of the inheritance clause, she’ll lose it."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. What inheritance clause?

She scrambled out of bed, nearly tripping over her silk robe. This wasn’t just idle gossip. This was a bomb. And Victoria—Nathan’s scheming secretary—knew everything.

Downstairs, the aroma of coffee wafted from the kitchen. Nathan stood by the counter, his back to her, broad shoulders tense as he scrolled through his phone. Normally, the sight of him would make her pulse flutter. Now? Her stomach twisted.

"Morning, sweetheart," he murmured without turning.

Evelyn forced a smile. Play it cool. "Morning. Sleep well?"

"Like a rock," he lied smoothly.

Except—she heard the truth beneath it. "Another nightmare about Eleanor. Damn it, why now?"

Eleanor. His first love. The one who died.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. She’d always suspected Nathan had shadows in his past, but this? A proposal based on money? Secrets about a dead ex?

And then, like a gift from the universe, Victoria’s voice hissed through her mind again: "Thank god he doesn’t know about the prenup loophole. Once they’re married, that trust fund is mine to control."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Game. On.

Luna recoiled in horror as her mother's deranged expression sent chills down her spine. She wrenched her wrist free from Penelope's iron grip, her wide eyes darting to her father in silent plea—Had her mother truly lost her mind?

Victor, too, was stunned. Though he harbored no love for Lucas, he would never sacrifice his own daughter's dignity just to ruin the young man. Some lines couldn’t be crossed.

Lucas finally snapped out of his shock, stepping forward with a glare sharp enough to cut glass. "You've lost it," he spat. "She's my sister. How dare you accuse me of something so vile? Do you hate me so much you'd rather destroy her than see me walk free?"

To Lucas, this was nothing but Penelope’s twisted retaliation for the night’s failed scheme. She had always assumed he would endure her cruelty without limits—but not this time.

Yet Penelope was relentless. "It was you! Don’t lie! I saw it—how you forced yourself on her! You're a monster! If you weren’t, I wouldn’t have to do this!" Her voice rose to a shriek, her eyes wild. "Everyone else might be fooled, but I know what you are!"

The room erupted in murmurs.

"What kind of madness is this?" Vivian blurted.

"She’s insane," Marcus muttered coldly.

"Good," Marcus Prescott added with a smirk. "Maybe now Lucas will finally stop believing she’s capable of love."

Vivian Grant’s cheeks flushed with fury. "This is disgusting. Lucas doesn’t deserve this."

Monster didn’t even begin to cover it. Penelope had never treated Lucas as her son, yet she had no qualms pinning every flaw of her golden child on him. As if he existed solely to absorb their sins.

The Blackwoods exchanged grim glances. Earlier, they’d pitied Penelope’s misfortunes—but now? Karma was a blade that cut both ways.

Nathan Blackwood observed the chaos, his gaze calculating. The moment had arrived. Even though Lucas had long given up on Penelope, the raw pain in his eyes was unmistakable.

"Enough," Nathan said, his voice slicing through the noise. "If you’re so certain, let’s settle this with proof." He pulled out his phone. "I’ll call the lab. We’ll do a DNA test—right now."

Silence fell.

Penelope’s face drained of color.

Lucas stiffened. "You can’t be serious."

Nathan didn’t flinch. "Deadly serious. If she’s accusing you of this, then let’s see the truth in black and white."

Luna’s breath hitched. A DNA test?

But before she could protest, Penelope lunged—not at Lucas, but at Nathan. "You bastard! This is none of your business!"

Nathan caught her wrist effortlessly, his voice icy. "Oh, but it is."

And with that, the game changed forever.

A sudden touch on his shoulder made Lucas spin around in surprise. His eyes met the cool, composed gaze of Beatrice Holloway, who rarely initiated physical contact.

To everyone's astonishment, Beatrice stepped forward, her voice cutting through the tension like ice.

"Mrs. Collins, perhaps you should reconsider your accusations before slandering someone. Earlier, when we had guests, Lucas was under constant observation. After you drugged him, he was with me—then rescued by friends. Meanwhile, your daughter never left the ballroom. When, exactly, would he have had the opportunity?"

Truthfully, Beatrice didn’t need to explain. The logic was obvious. But she refused to let Penelope’s lies go unchallenged.

As expected, Penelope’s face twisted in fury, her carefully crafted facade crumbling. "How dare you speak to me like that! He is my son, and I know him better than anyone! Are you suggesting a mother would lie about her own child?"

Her outburst silenced the room.

Then, a voice sliced through the tension.

"Unless you’re not his real mother."

Penelope froze. All eyes turned toward the speaker.

At first, people dismissed it as reckless gossip—until they saw who had spoken.

Nathan Blackwood never spoke without reason.

And standing beside him was Evelyn Sinclair, the uncanny truth-seeker of high society, whose sharp instincts never failed.

Evelyn’s eyes widened slightly at Nathan’s bold claim. No evidence? Just pure instinct? She exhaled in relief. Thank goodness he’s right. Otherwise, this would be embarrassing.

Nathan shot her an amused glance before turning back to the stunned crowd, his gaze locking onto Lucas.

Lucas trusted Nathan implicitly. His pulse raced as he demanded, "What do you mean by that?"

For the first time, Lucas wanted to believe he wasn’t Penelope’s son. He silently begged for Nathan to confirm it.

Nathan had no proof—yet he spoke with absolute certainty. "If Mrs. Collins isn’t delusional, then there’s only one explanation for her behavior—you’re not her biological son. That’s why she can manipulate you, ruin your reputation, and steal your inheritance without remorse."

The room erupted in murmurs.

Lucas’s breath hitched.

Was it possible?

Had his entire life been a lie?

The murmurs in the room thickened like fog, unspoken suspicions hanging heavy in the air. Many had wondered, but none had dared to voice it aloud—until now.

"Lies! All of it!" Penelope Collins—Ava's replacement—cut Nathan Blackwood off before he could finish, her voice a shrill, unhinged scream. Her eyes burned with a manic intensity, her fingers clawing at the air as if she could tear the truth apart with her bare hands. "He deserves every ounce of suffering I've given him! Do you know what he cost me? My husband died because of him! My life was ruined the moment he took his first breath! Why should I show him mercy?"

The sheer audacity of her delusion was staggering. She truly believed Lucas Thornton—formerly Damien—owed her for existing. As if his birth had been some calculated act of betrayal rather than the natural consequence of her own choices.

The Blackwoods exchanged stunned glances.

"And what about the rumors you spread?" Nathan continued, his voice icy. "The ones about him and Luna Morgan?" His gaze sharpened as Penelope's face drained of color. "The only reason you'd go that far is to hide the real scandal, isn't it?"

A beat of silence. Then—

"Wait." Vivian Moore—Elaine's counterpart—leaned forward, eyes gleaming with realization. "If Lucas isn't really her son... and Caleb Moore and Luna are siblings..." She gasped dramatically. "Did she switch them at birth?"

The room erupted.

"No! That's not—Lucas is mine! Caleb and Luna aren't—they can't be—!" Penelope's protests were frantic, her words tripping over each other in her panic. But the more she denied it, the more obvious the truth became.

Victor Reed—Sergio's replacement—staggered back as if struck. He knew Penelope better than anyone. And right now, the guilt in her eyes was undeniable.

Then—

A shriek.

Luna Morgan lunged for Penelope, her hands shaking as she gripped her mother's arms. "Tell me it's not true! Tell me Caleb and I aren't—!"

Her phone clattered to the floor in the struggle, the screen flashing with damning evidence of her own secrets, now forgotten in the wake of a far greater revelation.

Nathan didn't hesitate.

"Lucas," he said, turning to the silent figure at the edge of the room. "We can settle this right now." He pulled out his phone. "I know a lab. Results in three hours."

Penelope screamed.
###Chapter 289 The Moment Of Truth

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her plush velvet sofa, a steaming cup of Earl Grey in hand, scrolling through her phone with a smirk.

Oh, this is too good.

Her assistant, Lillian Graves, had just forwarded her the latest tabloid scoop—Seraphina Delacroix, the notorious second-tier actress, had been caught in a scandalous love triangle between her current beau, Adrian Cross, and her ex, Sebastian Hart. The photos were deliciously incriminating.

Evelyn chuckled, taking a slow sip of her tea. Karma’s a bitch, isn’t it, Seraphina?

The woman had been nothing but trouble since Evelyn had entered the industry—always snagging roles through questionable means, spreading rumors, and even trying to sabotage Evelyn’s reputation once. But now? The tables had turned spectacularly.

Her phone buzzed again. A message from Preston Whitmore, the director of her upcoming film:

"Heard the news? Might need to reshoot some scenes if Seraphina’s reputation tanks further. You up for a lead role adjustment?"

Evelyn’s lips curled into a feline grin. Oh, absolutely.

She typed back a coy response, careful not to sound too eager. But inside, her mind was already racing with possibilities. If Seraphina’s career imploded, that meant more screen time, better endorsements, and—most importantly—less drama on set.

A knock at her door interrupted her scheming.

"Come in," she called, setting her phone aside.

Nathan Blackwood stepped in, his tailored suit hugging his broad frame perfectly, his dark eyes scanning her amused expression. "You look like you just won the lottery."

Evelyn smirked. "Better. Seraphina’s finally getting what she deserves."

Nathan arched a brow, crossing his arms. "Do I even want to know?"

She waved her phone at him. "Oh, you definitely do."

As he leaned in to read the headline, his expression shifted from mild curiosity to outright amusement. "Well, well. Looks like karma caught up with her faster than expected."

Evelyn laughed, stretching like a satisfied cat. "And the best part? I might just benefit from it."

Nathan shook his head, though his lips twitched. "Never change, Evelyn."

She winked. "Why would I? The universe clearly loves rewarding my patience."

As he chuckled and walked away, Evelyn leaned back, savoring the moment. The entertainment industry was a battlefield, and today? She was winning.

And she had every intention of enjoying every second of it.

Luna shook her head violently, her voice trembling. "No, no! You and Caleb aren't siblings at all!"

Yet, despite her words, fear coiled in her chest. The possibility was too plausible to ignore.

"Then let's settle this with a DNA test," Eleanor declared suddenly, her tone resolute.

Her eyes, rimmed with unshed tears, flickered toward Lucas. Seeing him with his head bowed, her heart twisted painfully.

She continued, "This situation has troubled me for too long. Since Mrs. Collins refuses to speak rationally, we'll verify the most logical assumption ourselves."

As the head of the Winters family, Eleanor knew this was reckless. If they were wrong, it would shatter her relationship with Caleb beyond repair.

But after everything he had done—his cruelty, his entitlement—she no longer cared. For once, she wanted to trust her instincts.

How many times had she secretly wished Lucas was her son? There were moments when she saw herself in him—his strength, his resilience. She had always dismissed it as mere coincidence, the result of her guidance.

But now, faced with the truth, she wondered.

Caleb, on the other hand, was the spitting image of her spiteful sister-in-law—selfish, manipulative, and utterly devoid of empathy.

"Mother, you doubt me?" Caleb's voice was raw with betrayal. The demand for a DNA test was a knife to his pride. He was being discarded, replaced.

His lips curled into a sneer. "Fine. If that's how it is, then remember this—if the test proves I'm your son, don't expect me to ever call you 'Mother' again. You'll be dead to me."

Eleanor almost laughed. Stripped of her blind maternal love, his words were transparent.

He was terrified.

Deep down, he suspected the truth—that he was the fraud, the thief who had stolen Lucas’s life. And he couldn’t bear it.

"If you truly have the spine to follow through," she said coolly, "then perhaps you do have a shred of my blood in you."

With a sharp gesture, her security team moved forward. They would take the sample by force if necessary.

"You—you can't do this!" Penelope shrieked, her face contorted in panic. She whirled toward Lucas. "Are you just going to stand there? If you let them humiliate us like this, I'll kill myself right here!"

Lucas lifted his head, his gaze hollow. "I want the truth. If you choose to die over it, that’s your decision. But don’t expect guilt from me—not after everything you’ve done."

Penelope staggered back, stunned. The son she had controlled for years was no longer hers to manipulate.

Desperate, she lunged for a nearby letter opener—but the guards were faster. They seized her before she could even lift it.

The room fell silent.

The truth was moments away.

When Penelope lifted her gaze, she saw Lydia approaching. Reduced to a pitiful state, she had no choice but to turn to her husband for help in the end.

Meanwhile, Victor was still reeling from shock. He was a shrewd man, realizing the tide had turned—a DNA test was inevitable. At the same time, his wife’s reaction had already confirmed the truth.

We’re . The Reed family is done for. And so is Luna.

Luna was still frozen in panic, watching everything unfold while Caleb thrashed against the security guards, his face twisted in fury.

Lydia strode toward Penelope, her voice icy. "Resisting is pointless. You know me—I never stop halfway. If you confess now, you might spare yourself unnecessary suffering."

She would uncover the truth, but the more she thought about it, the more desperate she became for answers.

The veins in Penelope’s neck bulged. Just when everyone expected her to cling to her lies until the bitter end, she suddenly burst into wild, mocking laughter.

"Lydia Sanders, you deserved this! Every bit of it!"

Lydia’s face paled, and gasps rippled through the crowd. Only Caleb and Luna turned to stare at Penelope in stunned silence.

Was this finally the moment of truth?

Lucas had already stepped back, standing protectively beside his wife. Having achieved his goal, he now watched the scene unfold with quiet satisfaction.

Evelyn clutched Lucas’s hand, her pulse racing with anticipation.

Penelope had lost all restraint, her words dripping with venom. "You’re nothing but a fool! Raising my son for over twenty years while your own suffered—no father to protect him, no mother to love him. He had to grovel just to survive under your roof, desperate for even a scrap of affection. Pathetic, really. He never dared stand up to Caleb, even when bullied. This is your punishment—your own child paying the price!"

Each word was a knife to the heart.

Lydia, the formidable businesswoman, shattered in an instant. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she turned to Damian—only to find his face eerily blank, yet his own tears falling silently.

Her chest tightened in agony. She seized Penelope by the collar, her fingers trembling with rage. "Why? What did I ever do to you? How could you be so cruel? Tell me why!"

"Was it because of Jared?" Richard suddenly cut in, his voice rough with fury. "It was because of Jared, wasn’t it? You never let it go."

It was the first time he had ever raised his voice in anger. Though often overlooked, the instinct to protect his son flared now—his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

"What?" Lydia stared at her husband, bewildered.

A shadow of sorrow crossed Howard's face as he turned to Lydia. "I never imagined she could be so unhinged—capable of such madness," he confessed, his voice thick with regret. "I kept you in the dark to spare you the discomfort at home. But the truth is..."

As Howard unraveled the past, the twisted resentment Ava harbored became painfully clear to everyone.

Lydia and Damien stood frozen, their expressions unreadable. How had they been dragged into this feud between Jared and Ava? It was ludicrous.

Lydia caught Ava's venomous glare and shuddered, fury igniting within her. "Jared and I—we have nothing between us! I didn't even know about any of this! And you knew that! You knew everything! How could you be so cruel? You despise me—you despise Damien! What gives you the right—what gives?"

Ava's lips curled into a sneer. "Why shouldn't I hate you?" she spat, her voice dripping with self-righteous venom. "You married, yet you let my husband cling to his feelings for you. This is your fault. And him—" She jerked her chin toward Damien. "If it weren't for him, I wouldn’t have suffered so much!"

The room fell into stunned silence. Even Lydia gaped at her, disbelief etched across her face.

"Do you know why I had obstructed labor?" Ava hissed, her eyes wild. "Because we went into labor at the same time—and he stood outside your delivery room, worried sick over you! The stress nearly killed me! Ollie was born premature, and I almost died! Tell me—whose fault is that?"

###Chapter 290: The Slap That Echoed Through Lucas's Life

Mind Games and Juicy Revelations

The moment Evelyn Sinclair stepped into the gilded lobby of Blackwood Tower, she could feel the weight of unspoken secrets pressing against her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that came from years of buried scandals and whispered betrayals.

Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she made her way to the private elevator, her mind buzzing with the latest gossip she’d overheard. Nathan Blackwood’s sister, Sophia, was seen arguing with her husband, Daniel Prescott, in the middle of a high-society gala. And the whispers about Adriana—Daniel’s mistress—were getting louder.

Evelyn smirked. If there was one thing she excelled at, it was gathering intel.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Nathan himself, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "You're late," he said, his voice a low rumble that sent a shiver down her spine.

"Fashionably so," she countered, stepping inside. The doors closed, sealing them in the confined space. The tension between them crackled—part professional, part something far more dangerous.

Nathan leaned against the mirrored wall, arms crossed. "What’s got you so amused?"

She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Oh, just the usual high-society drama. Did you know your dear brother-in-law was spotted leaving Adriana’s penthouse at three in the morning?"

His jaw tightened. "Stay out of it, Evelyn."

She laughed, the sound light but edged with steel. "Oh, come on. You can’t expect me to ignore something this juicy. Especially when it involves your family."

The elevator dinged, signaling their arrival at the executive floor. As the doors opened, Nathan caught her wrist, pulling her close enough that she could feel the heat of his breath against her ear. "Be careful," he murmured. "Some secrets are better left buried."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened, but she refused to back down. "Or," she whispered back, "they’re just waiting for the right person to dig them up."

His grip tightened briefly before he released her, striding ahead without another word.

She followed, her mind already racing with possibilities. If Nathan thought she’d drop this, he was sorely mistaken. The Blackwood family had skeletons in their closet, and Evelyn was more than happy to rattle them.

After all, in their world, information was power—and she intended to wield it.

The absurd accusation twisted reality, painting her as the wronged party.

.

Though Penelope directed her words at Lydia, it was Richard who responded. "No. I wasn't present that night. My wife's vitals were already critical during labor. As the elder brother, it was his duty to care for her. But your petty theatrics triggered premature delivery. You orchestrated your own tragedy!"

His words struck like a hammer. Now he's become my voice. Someone needed to confront a blame-shifter like Mrs. Collins with cold facts. The crimson flush of shame spreading across her face proved she knew her arguments held no weight.

The Blackwoods nodded along with Evelyn's condemnation—Penelope's raised voice only betrayed her guilt.

"No! This was all Lydia and Lucas's fault! After I endured hours of labor to deliver Oliver, that man finally appeared—only to ignore our son completely! He rushed straight to your child, doting on him as if he were his own. His obsession with you made him disrespect me! I hate him! He should've cherished my son!"

"So you switched them." Lydia's jaw clenched, fury simmering beneath her words.

"Fate smiled on me. The boys grew strikingly similar. When you left on that business trip, I seized my chance. Not a soul noticed. Doesn't he deserve to be treated well? But then he died. Shortly after the switch, Lucas got him killed!"

"Madwoman! I remember now—Jared only left that night because you provoked him! His accident rests on your conscience!" Richard fired back.

"No! Lucas destroyed everything! Jared died searching for him!" Penelope shrieked.

A Winters family member spoke up. "Now I recall! Jared raced out because you lost track of Lucas. By the time we found Lucas, Jared's accident report arrived. That's why people called Lucas a curse. How differently things appear now..."

"Because of your twisted scheme, you neglected me—perhaps even wished me gone. But Jared believed I was Oliver. Though he never wanted that child, he still acted as a father should, desperately searching for his son... You killed him! Yet you made me bear the guilt all these years. Can't face that you destroyed the man you loved?"

Lucas's quiet dissection of truth ended with a hollow, mocking stare at Penelope.

She screamed—her final delusion ripped away.

"No! This is your fault! Both of you ruined everything!"

The truth was undeniable, no matter how much everyone wished it wasn’t.

The tragedy that had befallen Penelope’s family? Entirely her own doing.

Reasoning with a madwoman was futile. So, Beatrice decided to skip words and act.

She slapped Penelope—once for every year Lucas had lived.

By the time the onlookers processed what had happened, Penelope’s face was already swollen, her wrinkles stretched taut. Blood and saliva dripped from the corner of her mouth. At first, she was stunned. Then, she exploded.

"How dare you hit me!" she shrieked, her words slurred.

A second later, she turned her wild gaze to Lucas. "Are you just going to stand there while she assaults your mother?"

Lucas had been reeling from the revelation, his emotions a storm inside him. But now? He let out a cold, mocking laugh.

"Who are you talking to?" His voice was sharp, his eyes glinting with disdain. "Shouldn’t you be begging your real son, Caleb, for help?"

Caleb, as if snapping out of a trance, stared at Penelope with disgust. "No. She’s not my mother. Never." His voice was icy. "Explain yourself, you lunatic."

Penelope flinched at his rejection. "How can you say that? Everything I did was for you! I gave you every advantage—position, power—and you still failed! Why couldn’t you beat Lucas? Why couldn’t my son outshine hers?"

"Shut up!" Caleb snarled, his pride wounded. He didn’t care about their blood ties anymore.

Penelope’s eyes glazed over with madness. "No… it wasn’t your fault. It was hers—Beatrice Holloway!" She whirled toward Beatrice, venom dripping from her words.

"You already treated Caleb as your own, yet you refused to name him your heir. You wicked woman!"

Beatrice didn’t even need to defend herself. The crowd had already turned against Penelope.

"Karma always catches up."

"The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree."

"What kind of decent person could come from her? Both Caleb and Luna are monsters. Status can’t change nature."

"Ugh, don’t remind me. Just thinking about the things they’ve done makes me sick."

The murmurs grew louder, the judgment final.

Penelope had dug her own grave. And now, she was buried in it.

The revelation left everyone stunned. The truth was far more twisted than anyone could have imagined.

Lucas Thornton stood there, his expression unreadable. The years of torment he had endured under Penelope Collins’ cruelty were finally coming to light. And now, karma had struck back with a vengeance.

“This is unbelievable,” someone muttered in the crowd. “No wonder she was so desperate to pin everything on Lucas. She couldn’t even face the truth herself.”

“Disgusting,” another voice chimed in. “The entire family is rotten to the core.”

“It’s poetic justice,” a third person added. “The universe couldn’t stand her manipulations any longer. And yet, she still has the audacity to act like the victim.”

The whispers grew louder, each one more scathing than the last.

“Did you see the way she looked at him? After everything she’s done?”

“Rumor has it they’ve been involved for years. And it all started just to spite Lucas.”

“Unbelievable. What goes around, truly comes around.”

Then, a sharp, anguished scream cut through the murmurs. Luna Morgan, Penelope’s daughter, finally snapped.

“No! This isn’t true! Lucas is my brother!” she shrieked, her voice cracking under the weight of denial.

She couldn’t bring herself to look at Caleb Moore—the man who was, in fact, her real brother. Caleb, too, was reeling from the revelation, his face twisted in revulsion.

What have we done? The question echoed in his mind. How did it come to this?

Lucas, however, felt no sympathy.

“I’m not your brother,” he said coldly, his voice devoid of emotion. He pointed at Caleb. “He is. And from what I’ve heard, the two of you are already… close.”

The implication was clear. He wasn’t going to shield them from the consequences of their actions. Not after the years of suffering they had put him through.

Luna couldn’t take it. With a choked sob, she turned and fled, unable to face the truth any longer.

Caleb, too, wanted nothing more than to disappear. The stares of the crowd burned into him, each one filled with judgment and disgust.

Victor Reed, Luna’s father, hesitated for only a second before chasing after her, abandoning his wife without a second thought.

Penelope, momentarily snapping out of her daze, cried out in desperation. But the security guards held her firmly in place.

Then, as if by instinct, she turned her venomous glare toward Lucas.

“This is your fault!” she screamed, her voice raw with fury. “You knew! You knew about them, and you said nothing! If you had just spoken up sooner, none of this would have happened! How dare you let this happen!”

Her words were laced with venom, her rage blinding her to the truth—that she had no one to blame but herself.

But Lucas didn’t flinch.

He had waited years for this moment.

And now, justice would finally be served.

###Chapter 291 The Sweet Poison of Gossip

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She sipped her lavender-infused tea, her mind wandering as she absentmindedly scrolled through her phone.

Then, like a bolt of lightning, it happened.

A voice—sharp, unmistakable, and not her own—cut through her thoughts.

"If only Nathan knew what I did with those documents…"

Evelyn nearly choked on her tea. That wasn’t just any voice. That was Victoria Hayes’ voice—Nathan Blackwood’s scheming secretary.

But how?

She wasn’t even in the room.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened as another thought, dripping with smug satisfaction, slithered into her mind.

"By the time he finds out, it’ll be too late. The board will never trust him again."

Her fingers tightened around her cup. This wasn’t just gossip. This was treason.

And somehow… she was hearing it.

A slow smirk curled Evelyn’s lips. If Victoria thought she could sabotage Nathan without consequence, she had another thing coming.

But first—Evelyn needed to test this bizarre new ability.

She closed her eyes, focusing on the mental static around her.

And then…

"Ugh, Preston Whitmore is such a nightmare. Who schedules a 7 AM meeting on a Saturday?"

That was Lillian Graves, her assistant, grumbling from the next room.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

This wasn’t just a fluke.

She could hear people’s unfiltered thoughts.

And if Victoria’s scheming was any indication, this was going to be deliciously useful.

Nathan Blackwood strode into his office, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. But beneath that polished exterior, frustration simmered.

"Another leak. Third one this month. Someone in this company is playing a dangerous game."

Evelyn, perched on the edge of his desk, nearly laughed. Oh, Nathan had no idea how dangerous.

But she did.

And she was about to turn the tables.

"Long night?" she asked innocently, twirling a strand of hair around her finger.

Nathan’s gaze flicked to her, sharp and assessing. "You could say that."

"Why does she always look at me like she knows something I don’t?"

Evelyn’s grin widened.

Oh, darling. If only you knew.

By lunchtime, Evelyn had compiled a mental list of secrets that could topple empires.

Victoria’s document forgery.

Marcus Donovan’s embezzlement.

Even Preston Whitmore’s very inappropriate crush on his lead actress.

But the pièce de résistance?

Nathan’s own sister, Sophia Blackwood, was secretly funneling company funds into her husband’s failing startup.

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, exhaling slowly.

This wasn’t just power.

This was leverage.

And she intended to use every last bit of it.

That evening, as she slipped into a sleek black dress for the charity gala, Evelyn caught another whisper of thought—this time, from Nathan himself.

"Why is she so damn irresistible?"

She paused, lipstick hovering mid-application.

Well, well.

This ability just kept getting better.

With a final glance in the mirror, Evelyn smirked.

Time to make some waves.

And oh, how the sharks would circle.

Seriously? Even now, this woman thinks she can manipulate Lucas using her title as his mother? To force him to clean up her mess? She must be completely delusional! Evelyn thought to herself, barely suppressing her disbelief.

Not just Evelyn—nearly everyone present was staring at Penelope as if she had lost her mind.

In response to Penelope’s desperate plea, a cold smirk curled Lucas’s lips.

She had grown so accustomed to his endless concessions in the past that she still couldn’t grasp reality.

"I warned you, didn’t I?" Lucas spoke slowly, his voice dripping with disdain. "She was running with the wrong crowd, but you were too busy blaming me to listen. Maybe this is fate’s way of teaching you a lesson."

Penelope froze, her face twisting with regret. Her pupils trembled—she still couldn’t accept it. Lucas’s gaze had turned glacial. Yes, she loved her children deeply, but her selfishness and stupidity had ruined them.

"What you should be worrying about now is yourself. We still have un business."

Penelope flinched at the sudden shift in Lucas’s tone, instinctively stepping back.

Lydia chimed in, her voice sharp. "Yes, let’s settle the score."

Richard, too, was seething with resentment. Accepting Lucas as his own hadn’t been difficult—after his elder brother’s death, he had been the closest paternal figure in the Winters family. He had always tried to treat Lucas like his own son.

Now, realizing his child had been stolen away for over two decades, guilt consumed him. Without hesitation, he stood firmly by his son’s side.

He took a decisive step forward, and in that moment, the three of them truly became a united front.

The onlookers exchanged knowing glances.

Evelyn watched with satisfaction. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree—this family is cut from the same cloth.

Nathan chuckled softly, pleased with the outcome.

Opposite them stood the defeated Penelope and Caleb.

Penelope was stunned—bossing Lucas around had been second nature to her.

But Lucas was no longer the son she could vent her frustrations on.

Her eyes widened in dawning horror as she finally understood—it was over.

Her lips trembled, but before she could speak, Caleb suddenly broke free from his restraints and lunged at her.

"Madwoman! This is all your fault! You've destroyed everything for me! Ruined it all! Why don't you just drop dead? Just die!"

The sudden impact sent the security guards stumbling, unable to hold onto Penelope. She was knocked to the ground, her face contorted in agony. A sharp cough wracked her body before she could even catch her breath, crimson staining her lips.

The crowd gasped, stunned by the scene unfolding before them. Caleb Moore stood over his mother, his eyes blazing with murderous fury. It was clear—his emotions had shattered beyond repair.

Penelope, trembling with indignation, spat back, "I only ever cared for you! But you're just like your father—choosing that wretched Lydia over me!"

"Shut your mouth!" Caleb roared, his voice raw with rage. "Do you think I'm as blind as Lucas? Everything you did was for yourself, not for me. You couldn't handle the truth, so you abandoned me. What kind of mother throws her own son away?"

Tsk, tsk, tsk. Finally, Caleb directed his hatred where it belonged. He knew the root of his suffering—his own birth mother.

Nathan Blackwood glanced over, unsurprised to see Penelope's face drain of color in an instant.

For the first time, the onlookers felt a pang of pity for Caleb.

"A mother who gives her child away has no right to expect love in return."

"And she drove his father to his death. Unforgivable."

"Don’t forget—her lies led her own children into an incestuous nightmare."

"The worst part? It all started with a stolen marriage. Yet she still demanded love from a man she trapped. When he refused, she blamed everyone but herself."

"Disgusting. Absolutely shameless."

"Did she really think she could compete with Lydia? Pathetic. As if Grayson would ever choose her."

"If I were Grayson, I’d have loathed her from the start."

The whispers struck Penelope like lashes, each word carving deeper into her bones, searing her soul. And then there was Caleb—her own son—glaring at her with pure hatred.

In that moment, she aged decades. Yet still, she shook her head violently, denying something only she could name.

There was no need for further spectacle.

Lucas had already signaled the butler to call the police. Tonight’s events—and the sins of twenty years past—would finally face justice.

And the Blackwood family? They wouldn’t let a single transgression slide.

The engagement party had spectacularly imploded. Guests, thoroughly sated with the evening's revelations, were being ushered out by the Winters family with polite but firm efficiency.

Curiously, the reporters Oliver had invited weren’t asked to delete their footage. It was a tacit approval—Lydia Winters was determined to expose the truth, no matter how scandalous. If the world was going to talk, she would make sure they had the full story.

"Won’t this backfire on Lucas and Beatrice?" Evelyn murmured, watching Nathan discreetly instruct security to ensure the reporters omitted any mention of the two.

Nathan turned to her, his expression patient. "Mrs. Lydia is worried that if the story gets twisted, Lucas and Beatrice could be framed. Better to control the narrative now than let our enemies spin it first."

"Rumors spread faster than truth," Daniel Wright remarked, stepping closer.

"Exactly," Vivian Moore agreed, draping an arm over Evelyn’s shoulders with a mischievous grin. "This way, public opinion works in their favor—Lucas securing his inheritance, Beatrice getting formally adopted." She clicked her tongue playfully. "Smart move."

"What?" Evelyn blinked.

Nathan’s gaze dropped to Vivian’s arm around his wife, his brow twitching.

"Oh, come on," Vivian Grant chimed in, looping her own arm through Evelyn’s. "You’re the star of the show tonight. Next time there’s drama, invite me. This was way more entertaining than I expected."

Nathan’s frown deepened.

Evelyn followed Vivian’s gaze and realized—everyone was staring at her.

Her reputation was snowballing: Justice Bringer. Scandal Queen. Was it her fault people kept doing outrageous things in front of her?

The wealthy thrived on drama. The working class? Too busy surviving to indulge in such theatrics.

Seriously? Even now, this woman thinks she can manipulate Lucas using her maternal status? To force him to clean up her mess? She must be drowning in delusion! Evelyn thought, her disbelief almost palpable.

Not just Evelyn, but nearly everyone present was staring at Penelope as if she had lost her mind.

In response to Penelope’s desperate plea, a cold smirk tugged at Lucas’s lips.

She had grown so accustomed to his endless concessions in the past that she still couldn’t grasp reality—even now.

"I warned you, didn’t I?" Lucas spoke slowly, his voice laced with icy detachment. "She was running with the wrong crowd, but you were too busy blaming me to listen. Maybe this is fate’s cruel joke."

Penelope froze, her face twisting with regret. Her pupils trembled, her denial still evident. Lucas’s gaze had turned glacial. Yes, she did love her children—but her selfishness and stupidity had destroyed them.

"What you should be worrying about now is yourself. We still have un business."

Penelope flinched at the sudden venom in his tone, stumbling back a step.

Lydia chimed in, her voice sharp. "Yes, let’s settle the score."

Howard’s resentment burned just as fiercely. Accepting Lucas as his own hadn’t been difficult—after his elder brother’s death, he was the closest paternal figure Lucas had left in the Winters family. He had always tried to treat him like a son.

Now, realizing his child had been stolen from him for over two decades, guilt and fury warred within him. Without hesitation, he stepped forward, aligning himself with Lucas and Lydia.

For the first time, they truly stood as a united family.

The onlookers exhaled in quiet awe.

Evelyn watched, satisfied. Like father, like son. This family is terrifyingly alike.

Nathan chuckled softly beside her, equally pleased with the outcome.

Opposite them stood Penelope and Caleb—crushed, cornered, and utterly defeated.

Penelope was stunned. Bossing Lucas around had been second nature to her.

But Lucas was no longer the obedient son she could vent her frustrations on.

Her lips trembled as the realization finally struck—it was over.

Before she could utter another word, Caleb—who had been restrained nearby—suddenly broke free and lunged at her.

The air crackled with tension as Caleb Moore lunged forward, his face twisted in fury. "You insane woman! This is all your fault! You've destroyed everything for me! Ruined it all! Why don't you just die? Just die!"

The security guards, caught off guard by the sudden outburst, lost their grip on Penelope Collins. She stumbled backward, crashing onto the marble floor with a sickening thud. Pain contorted her features as she gasped for breath, a trickle of blood escaping her lips.

The room froze.

Every eye was locked on Caleb, his expression murderous, his body trembling with unchecked rage. It was clear—he had snapped.

Penelope, clutching her chest, spat out between ragged breaths, "I—I was only trying to protect you! But you're just like your father! Both of you would rather choose that wretched Lydia over me!"

A guttural roar tore from Caleb's throat. "Shut your mouth! Do you think I'm as blind as Lucas? Everything you did was for yourself, not for me! You couldn't handle the truth, so you abandoned me! What kind of mother hands her own son to someone else to raise?"

A murmur rippled through the crowd.

Finally.

Finally, Caleb had directed his hatred where it belonged—at the woman who had orchestrated his misery.

Nathan Blackwood's gaze flickered toward Penelope, and sure enough, her face had drained of all color.

For the first time, the onlookers felt a pang of sympathy for Caleb.

"Honestly, what did she expect?" someone muttered. "Giving your child away and then demanding loyalty?"

"And she killed his father. Who does that?"

"Don’t forget she practically engineered an incestuous relationship between her own children through sheer negligence."

"The worst part? All of this started because she stole a marriage. And yet she still had the audacity to demand love from a man who never wanted her."

"Pathetic."

"Did she really think she could compete with Lydia? Please. Even Jared wasn’t that blind."

The whispers struck Penelope like lashes, each one carving deeper into her pride. And then there was Caleb—her own son—glaring at her with pure loathing.

She looked decades older in an instant.

But still, she shook her head violently, as if denial could rewrite the past.

There was no need for further theatrics.

Lucas Thornton had already signaled for the police. Whether it was tonight’s disaster or the sins from twenty years ago—justice would be served.

And the Blackwoods?

They weren’t the forgiving type.

The engagement party had spectacularly imploded. Guests, drunk on scandal and intrigue, were being ushered out by the Winters family with polite but firm efficiency.

Oddly enough, the reporters Oliver had invited weren’t forced to delete their footage. It was as if the family had silently given their blessing—no, more than that. It was a calculated move.

Lydia Winters was determined to expose the truth, no matter how ugly. If the world was going to talk, they might as well hear the full story—who her son really was, and who had orchestrated this tragedy from the shadows.

Evelyn watched as Nathan discreetly instructed his men to ensure the reporters omitted any mention of Lucas and Beatrice.

"Won’t this backfire on them?" she asked, frowning.

Nathan turned to her, his expression unreadable. "If the full truth isn’t out there, people will twist the narrative. They’ll paint Lucas and Beatrice as villains, and both families will suffer for it. Better to control the story now than let our enemies spin it first."

"Rumors spread faster than fire," Daniel added, stepping closer. "Once they take hold, they’re impossible to stamp out."

Vivian slung an arm around Evelyn’s shoulders, grinning. "Exactly. This way, they shape public opinion in their favor. Pave the way for Lucas to take over the family and Beatrice to be formally adopted." She winked. "Clever, isn’t it?"

Then she tilted her head, studying Evelyn with amusement. "What?"

Nathan’s gaze flicked to Vivian’s arm, his jaw tightening.

"Oh, come on," Vivian laughed. "Haven’t you noticed? You’re the star of the show."

Vivian Grant sidled up on Evelyn’s other side, looping her arm through hers with a conspiratorial smirk. "Next time there’s drama, invite me. This was way more entertaining than I expected."

Nathan’s frown deepened as he eyed the two women clinging to his wife.

Evelyn followed Vivian’s gaze and realized—every eye in the room was on her. The weight of their stares was almost palpable.

Justice Upholder. Gossip Queen. The titles kept piling up. But was it really her fault? If people didn’t do scandalous things, there’d be no scandals to uncover.

The rich and famous thrived on drama. It was inevitable. Ordinary people were too busy surviving to indulge in theatrics, but the elite? Their lives were a never-ending spectacle.

Gossip wasn’t just entertainment—it was sustenance. And right now, the hunger in the room was ravenous.

Nathan’s patience snapped. He stepped forward, using the back of his hand to gently (but firmly) dislodge Vivian and Vivian from Evelyn’s sides. His broad frame blocked most of the stares as he pulled Evelyn close, shielding her from the prying eyes.

###Chapter 292: The Confusion Deepens

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She traced her fingers over the bold title of the latest project—Midnight Whispers—her heart pounding with anticipation. This role could redefine her career.

Nathan Blackwood leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, watching her with an amused smirk. "Still obsessing over that script?"

Evelyn shot him a playful glare. "It’s not obsession. It’s preparation."

Nathan chuckled, pushing off the frame to stride toward her. He plucked the script from her hands, flipping through the pages. "You’ve already memorized half of it. What’s left to prepare?"

She snatched it back. "The other half."

His phone buzzed before he could retort. A frown darkened his features as he read the message.

Evelyn’s playful mood evaporated. "What’s wrong?"

Nathan exhaled sharply. "Victoria Hayes just leaked details about our engagement to the press."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "What? How?"

"Does it matter?" Nathan’s jaw tightened. "She’s been waiting for an opportunity like this."

Evelyn’s fingers curled around the script, crumpling the edges. Victoria, Nathan’s former secretary and long-time adversary, had always resented their relationship. But this—this was sabotage.

Her phone chimed with a notification. A news alert flashed across the screen: Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood’s Secret Engagement Exposed!

Nathan’s hand covered hers, warm and steady. "We’ll handle this."

Evelyn met his gaze, the storm in his eyes mirroring hers. "How?"

A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "By turning her game against her."

Meanwhile, across town, Victoria Hayes sipped her latte, satisfaction curling through her as she scrolled through the headlines. The media frenzy had already begun.

Her phone rang. An unknown number.

She answered, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Hello?"

A smooth, unfamiliar voice responded. "Miss Hayes, I believe we have a mutual interest in discussing Nathan Blackwood."

Victoria’s grip tightened on her cup. "Who is this?"

The caller chuckled. "Let’s just say… I have a proposition for you."

A shiver ran down her spine. This wasn’t part of her plan.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn’s assistant, Lillian Graves, burst in, her tablet clutched tightly. "You need to see this."

Evelyn took the device, her breath catching at the live footage of Nathan’s brother, Julian Blackwood, surrounded by reporters.

"Mr. Blackwood!" a journalist shouted. "Any comment on your brother’s engagement?"

Julian smirked, adjusting his cufflinks. "Oh, I have plenty to say."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Nathan’s phone buzzed again—a message from Julian: Time to settle our debts, brother.

The screen went black.

Evelyn looked up, meeting Nathan’s hardened expression. The game had just gotten more dangerous.

And Victoria Hayes wasn’t the only player.

The room had been buzzing with lively chatter, but the moment Nathan made his unexpected move, everyone fell silent, their eyes wide with disbelief.

He was becoming more and more unrecognizable to them. Their gazes then shifted to Evelyn, who remained utterly unfazed, as if she hadn’t noticed a thing.

Wasn’t it just a short while ago that Evelyn had been the one hopelessly infatuated, relentlessly pursuing Nathan?

Had the roles reversed now?

Given the current dynamic between the two, it wouldn’t be surprising if wedding bells were already in the works.

Speaking of weddings, Daniel and Vivian exchanged sympathetic glances toward Marcus. Though it might have been presumptuous, they couldn’t help but imagine the inevitable gossip if Evelyn attended any event without stirring up drama.

Marcus seemed to sense their thoughts, yet his expression remained carefree. He draped an arm around his beloved Vivian’s shoulders, flashing her a teasing grin. "Next time we gather for gossip, it’ll probably be at my place. Who knows what kind of spectacle we’ll witness then."

"Must you always be like this?" Vivian chuckled, lightly swatting his chest. "Behave yourself."

"That depends entirely on whether they behave," Marcus countered with a smirk. "Anyway, I have my doubts about the baby in my father’s new wife’s belly. I’m not entirely convinced it’s my little brother. It’d be perfect if Evelyn could help me verify it." He winked. "After all, the truth always comes out when Evelyn gets involved with someone who has… issues."

Am I some kind of human lie detector now? Shouldn’t you be consulting a doctor for this?

No sooner had Marcus spoken than Nathan shot him a sharp glare, clearly displeased with someone speaking about his wife in such a manner.

Marcus immediately raised his hands in surrender, offering an apologetic smile.

"Wait—your father’s new wife is pregnant?" Vivian gasped, stunned.

Not just her—even Daniel looked taken aback, his eyes widening in surprise.

Marcus arched a brow and let out a dry laugh. "See? Even you think it’s suspicious, right? And apparently, it was a natural conception, not IVF. Not that I disrespect her, but… it’s hard to believe."

At this, Evelyn’s eyes gleamed with interest. She already knew about this, having stumbled upon the information while keeping tabs on Marcus’s latest drama.

The Prescott family was a classic example of the old saying, "The more sons, the more blessings." In their world, the more sons a man had, the greater his contribution to the family—and the larger his share of the inheritance. That was why Marcus’s father, Grayson, had a swarm of brothers—over a dozen of them, with the youngest barely older than Marcus himself.

Influenced by this tradition, Grayson also believed in having as many children as possible. He even saw it as a competition with his siblings. So, not long after Marcus was born, he impregnated his wife again. Unfortunately, due to complications from the rushed pregnancy, both the mother and the newborn died during childbirth, leaving Marcus motherless.

When Nathan first met Marcus, Marcus was the poster child for a troubled youth, seemingly abandoned by parental guidance.

Growing up motherless with a father too obsessed with remarrying and expanding his family, the title of "eldest grandson" felt more like a cruel joke than an honor.

Despite Ralph—no, Grayson—taking multiple wives over the years, no more children followed. A visit to the doctor revealed he had a naturally low fertility rate. Looking back, it was Grayson’s mother who had been unusually fertile—otherwise, the Prescott bloodline might have ended with him. Now in his fifties, even if he found another woman with a high fertility rate, conception would be near impossible. No wonder Marcus was skeptical.

Evelyn had never met Grayson or his latest wife, Adriana Laurent, so she could only piece together the situation from Marcus’s frustrated ramblings.

Marcus was still venting, his voice tight with irritation. "Vivian and I met her. She’s around our age, soft-spoken, and weirdly eager to please me. But let’s be real—what kind of decent woman gets involved with my father? She’s just another secretary who clawed her way up by stepping on her predecessor. I’ve lost count of how many wives he’s had. If not for the family’s ironclad prenups, he’d be broke by now."

At that moment, Vivian’s expression flickered with something unreadable.

Vivian was usually the picture of sweetness, her face an open book of cheerful naivety. So when confusion or distress crossed her features, it was impossible to miss—especially for Evelyn and Nathan, who stood directly across from her.

Nathan wasn’t one to pry into others’ personal affairs, but Evelyn? She lived for gossip.

The second she caught that look, her curiosity flared. Oh, this is interesting.

Vivian had mixed feelings about Adriana. On one hand, she seemed kind and gentle. But during their first dinner together, when Marcus mentioned marrying Vivian, Adriana had pulled her aside and said something… strange.

Even Nathan’s interest was piqued now.

Was she marking her territory? he wondered. Does she see Marcus as competition for her unborn child and wanted to intimidate Vivian?

Adriana had whispered, "While society insists on marriages of equal standing, it’s cruel to chain someone already suffering to an alliance. If you truly love him, set him free. When I marry into the Prescott family, I’ll ensure the next generation has the right to choose their own partners. I want them to find real happiness—real love. And I hope you find someone who truly loves you too."

Nathan blinked.

What kind of twisted logic is that?

Evelyn mirrored his thoughts aloud. "Even I’m confused, and I wasn’t the one she said it to."

Nathan mentally agreed. It was baffling. Adriana’s words sounded like the idealistic ramblings of someone who’d never navigated high society’s cutthroat politics. She preached freedom in love, but how could she be so sure Vivian and Marcus weren’t together by choice?

Vivian, caught in the middle, looked more lost than ever.

And the real question lingered—what game was Adriana really playing?

Evelyn observed Vivian and Marcus from across the room. Marcus was practically glued to Vivian, his arms wrapped around her like a possessive vine. Their affection was so palpable it made the air around them thick with sweetness. Anyone with eyes could see they were deeply, madly in love.

So why couldn’t Adriana see it?

Was the woman blind? Or was there something more sinister at play?

No wonder Vivian had such mixed feelings about Adriana after hearing her ridiculous claims.

But honestly, Evelyn wasn’t worried. Marcus and Vivian wouldn’t have to deal with the older generation for long. After the wedding, they’d likely jet off abroad again, far from the drama.

There were two reasons the couple hadn’t tied the knot yet. First, every time Grayson Brooks returned home, he dragged himself into some scandal or another—bad omens all around. Second, the Grants adored their daughter and weren’t in any rush to let her go.

Of course, Evelyn had uncovered the real reasons through her Gossip System. But this was Vivian’s private business, and Evelyn had only stumbled upon it by accident. Even Nathan’s friends seemed clueless. So, she’d decided to play dumb. As long as the two of them were happy, nothing else mattered.

Still, they were both twenty-eight now—old enough to settle down. Maybe this wedding would finally push them to make it official.

Meanwhile, Marcus was still rambling, completely unfazed by the idea of someone contesting his inheritance. All he cared about was Vivian. Love was enough for him. Ambition? What was that?

Just then, his phone buzzed.

An unknown number.

He frowned and answered.

"Hello? Is this Marcus? It’s me."

A woman’s voice—soft, hesitant.

Marcus blinked. "Who is this?"

The voice dropped, laced with hurt. "You didn’t even save my number? It’s Adriana Laurent."

Marcus’s expression blanked. "Ms. Laurent? Why are you calling me? Does my father need something?"

The silence on the other end was deafening.

Then, a quiet, trembling breath.

"Marcus… don’t you remember anything?"

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed.

Oh, this was interesting.
###Chapter 293 Acting So Odd

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She traced her fingers over the bold letters of the title—Midnight Whispers—her latest project with Nathan Blackwood. A thrill shot through her.

Her phone buzzed. Nathan Blackwood flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn," his deep voice resonated, sending a familiar warmth through her. "We need to talk about the script changes."

She exhaled. "I know. The ending feels rushed."

"Exactly." A pause. "Meet me at The Velvet Lounge in an hour?"

Her pulse quickened. The Velvet Lounge—their usual spot, dimly lit, intimate. Dangerous.

"Fine," she said, feigning indifference.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the lounge, her gaze locked onto Nathan. He sat in their usual corner booth, his dark hair slightly tousled, his piercing blue eyes scanning the script. He looked up, and the intensity in his stare made her breath hitch.

"You're late," he murmured, sliding a glass of her favorite rosé toward her.

"Traffic," she lied, taking the seat opposite him.

Nathan leaned forward, his voice dropping. "The studio wants a happy ending."

Evelyn scoffed. "Since when do we cater to clichés?"

"Since the ratings dipped last season." His jaw tightened. "They think audiences want a fairy tale."

She clenched her fists. "Then they don’t understand our story."

Nathan’s fingers brushed hers—accidentally?—as he flipped a page. "What if we give them a twist instead?"

Her heart raced. "What kind of twist?"

A slow smirk curved his lips. "One where the heroine doesn’t choose between love and ambition. She takes both."

Evelyn’s breath caught. That wasn’t in the script. That was them.

The air between them crackled.

Then her phone rang—Victoria Hayes, her ever-persistent secretary.

Evelyn hesitated.

Nathan’s gaze darkened. "Ignore it."

For once, she did.

Across the city, in a sleek high-rise office, Victoria Hayes scowled at her unanswered call. She tapped her manicured nails against the desk.

"Still avoiding you?" Lillian Graves, Evelyn’s assistant, smirked from the doorway.

Victoria’s eyes narrowed. "She’s with him again."

Lillian shrugged. "You can’t compete with Nathan Blackwood."

Victoria’s lips curled into a cold smile. "We’ll see about that."

She pulled out a file labeled CONFIDENTIAL and flipped it open. Inside were photos—Evelyn and Nathan, their stolen moments, their undeniable chemistry.

"Everyone has a weakness," Victoria murmured. "Even golden boys like Nathan."

She picked up her phone and dialed a number.

"Mr. Holloway? We need to talk."

Back at The Velvet Lounge, Evelyn’s laughter filled the air as Nathan recounted a ridiculous on-set mishap. For a moment, it was just them—no scripts, no expectations.

Then his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, and his expression hardened.

Evelyn frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Nathan pocketed his phone. "Nothing." But his tone said otherwise.

She reached for his hand. "Nathan—"

He pulled away. "We should focus on the script."

The shift was sudden, icy.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. Something was wrong.

And she intended to find out what.

Marcus let out a weary sigh as he spoke, his usual playful demeanor replaced by reluctant exasperation. He tapped the speakerphone icon, allowing everyone in the room to hear the conversation.

"It's like this," Adriana's hesitant voice floated through the line. "I need to go for a prenatal checkup, but your father isn’t available. Could you come with me?" She paused, then added softly, "You know my pregnancy is high-risk."

The room fell into stunned silence. Had Adriana and Marcus shared a cordial relationship, her request might have made sense. But the two were far from close—barely more than strangers tied by circumstance.

Marcus shot Vivian a look of disbelief before responding, "No way. You're the dangerous one here. I should stay far away. If something goes wrong, guess who gets blamed for ruining my father’s late-life joy? Not taking that risk. Find someone else—preferably someone who won’t raise suspicions. That way, we both sleep better."

He muffled the phone against his chest and turned to the others. "Is she seriously trying to pit me against her?"

No one had an answer. Wealthy families bred peculiar dramas, but this was pushing even their tolerance for absurdity.

Then again, Adriana seemed to have no relatives by her side. Asking Marcus—the family’s heir—for help wasn’t entirely unreasonable.

Daniel mouthed silently, "Your dad’s idea?"

As if on cue, Adriana’s voice crackled through the speaker again. "It was your father’s suggestion."

Vivian immediately flashed Daniel an impressed grin. He merely shrugged, as if to say, Obvious.

Evelyn’s gaze lingered on Daniel with admiration. Cop instincts never fail. Faster than Nathan’s deductions.

Nathan caught her expression and bristled. He had considered the possibility—he just hadn’t voiced it. Now, watching his wife admire another man, jealousy prickled under his skin.

Marcus rolled his eyes. "I don’t care whose idea it was. Does she think I’ve got nothing better to do?"

Before he could refuse, Adriana spoke again, her voice laced with a sorrowful tremor. "Regardless, this child is your flesh and blood. Don’t you care at all?"

A shiver raced down Marcus’s spine.

Good grief. To an outsider, that tone would suggest she wasn’t talking about his half-sibling—but his own child. Evelyn’s brows knitted together. Women picked up on these nuances faster than men.

Vivian’s face twisted in disgust, as if she’d swallowed something foul.

Even Vivian, usually slow on the uptake, shifted uncomfortably.

"Why would I care?" Marcus scoffed. "This kid’s going to fight me for inheritance and Dad’s affection. Save the guilt trip—I’m not—"

"I—I didn't mean it like that. How could this child ever compare to you? Don't worry, it's impossible." Adriana's voice wavered, but she quickly steadied herself, forcing restraint into her tone. "I'm just... not feeling well right now. Could you help me, just this once? Please?"

The more Adriana acted this way, the more Marcus grew suspicious. She was playing the victim, but he sensed a trap lurking beneath her fragile facade.

Just as he was about to refuse, Vivian gently tugged at his sleeve.

Adriana's words had clearly irritated Vivian, stirring an instinctive dislike. Yet, concern lingered. The baby in Adriana's belly might one day be Marcus's half-sibling—the closest blood relative he'd have outside of his immediate family.

Marcus had once admitted he wouldn’t mind having well-behaved siblings. He was even open to forming bonds with them.

The last time Vivian saw Adriana, the woman had been cradling her stomach protectively, her love for the unborn child unmistakable.

Putting aside her discomfort, Vivian considered that Adriana might genuinely be in distress. With Grayson unavailable, she probably just wanted someone dependable by her side.

"Let's go together," Vivian mouthed.

Marcus hesitated, but then something flickered in his eyes. His expression shifted subtly before he affectionately brushed his fingers through Vivian’s hair, replying silently, "Whatever you say, love."

Vivian smiled.

With that, Marcus assured Adriana over the phone that he’d handle the situation before hanging up.

By the time Beatrice came looking for them, Vivian and Marcus had already left.

Meanwhile, the remaining guests were deep in discussion about the upcoming Burke family wedding—and Adriana’s peculiar behavior.

Beatrice blinked in surprise. She’d expected everyone to still be buzzing about the earlier scandal.

"You're all talking about this instead?" she exclaimed, amused at how quickly gossip moved on.

"We’re professionals at this point," Vivian Moore declared shamelessly, slinging an arm around Beatrice’s shoulders. "No matter how explosive the news, it’s just another day for us. So, how’s it going, future honorary Winters?"

Beatrice sighed. "That’s it for now. I’m heading back. You all coming?"

"Isn’t Lucas coming out?" Daniel asked.

"The Winters family has a lot to discuss. And besides—" Before Beatrice could finish, the sharp wail of police sirens cut through the air.

Guests still lingering in the mansion watched in stunned silence as Penelope and Caleb Moore were escorted out, struggling awkwardly against the officers.

From the doorway, the newly reunited family of three stood, watching as the people who had once tormented them were led away.

The irony wasn’t lost on anyone.

The small group couldn't help but notice Lucas's unusual demeanor. His expression was carefully blank, but the tension in his jaw betrayed his inner turmoil. Pride, however, kept him from showing any sign of weakness.

After exchanging brief goodbyes, they all walked away together.

"So, you're really going to become Mrs. Harrison's goddaughter, Beatrice?" Vivian arched a brow, her tone teasing. "That would make you Lucas's godsister, wouldn’t it? First his fiancée, now his sister—you two really can’t escape each other. Why not just admit there’s something between you?"

Beatrice pressed her lips together, her usual composure slipping just slightly.

Back when I didn’t know about Lucas’s past, things were simpler. Now, it’s almost comical—his crush is about to become his godsister. Evelyn smirked to herself.

Nathan gave a knowing glance. Knowing Lucas, once this mess is sorted, he’ll chase after Beatrice if she’s still single. The real question is—will she let him?

Sure enough, Beatrice scoffed. "Enough jokes. I finally got my freedom after completing that ridiculous family task. Why would I willingly walk into another prison?"

"See? This is why we get along. Different personalities, same views on marriage," Vivian laughed.

"Exactly. Marriage is a cage," Evelyn added dryly.

The moment the words left her mouth, everyone turned to stare—then slowly shifted their gazes to Nathan.

Nathan tugged at Evelyn’s sleeve subtly, his expression a mix of amusement and wounded pride.

Evelyn blinked. Right. I’m married now. Probably shouldn’t say things like that.

She quickly amended, "A happy marriage isn’t!"

###Chapter 294 The Oracle of Scandals in Ancient Gregan

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble countertops of her kitchen. She sipped her coffee, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp scent of fresh-cut flowers on the table.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Nathan Blackwood.

"We need to talk. Tonight. My place."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. The last time Nathan had summoned her like this, it had been about the scandal with Victoria Hayes. What now?

She exhaled sharply, setting her cup down with a clink.

Across town, Nathan stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, his reflection a stark contrast against the city skyline. His jaw was set, his usual composed demeanor fraying at the edges. The board meeting had been a disaster—Victoria had made sure of that.

His phone lit up with Evelyn’s reply.

"Fine. But this better be good."

A smirk tugged at his lips. She never made things easy for him.

Meanwhile, Victoria Hayes adjusted the diamond bracelet on her wrist, her lips curling into a satisfied smile as she scrolled through the latest headlines. "Blackwood Empire in Turmoil After Shocking Boardroom Leak."

Perfect.

She had spent months planting the seeds of doubt, manipulating the media, and now, Nathan’s carefully constructed empire was beginning to crumble. And Evelyn? She was just collateral damage.

But Victoria hadn’t accounted for one thing—Evelyn wasn’t the type to go down without a fight.

As evening fell, Evelyn arrived at Nathan’s penthouse, her heels clicking against the polished floors. He was waiting for her, his back turned, his broad shoulders tense.

"You’re late," he said without turning around.

"I had things to do," she retorted, crossing her arms. "What’s so urgent?"

Nathan finally turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Victoria’s playing a dangerous game. And she’s dragging you into it."

Evelyn scoffed. "Since when do you care?"

His expression darkened. "Since always."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Then, his phone buzzed—an alert. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening.

Evelyn frowned. "What now?"

Nathan’s voice was grim. "She just leaked another file. This time, it’s about you."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

Victoria had crossed a line.

And now, the real war was about to begin.

Vivian's teasing remark sent the group into peals of laughter.

"So, your marriage with Nathan is actually blissful?" she prodded, winking at Evelyn.

Evelyn froze, her cheeks flushing as she struggled to respond. Her gaze flickered to Nathan, whose usually stormy gray eyes now shimmered like liquid mercury under the moonlight. When she looked closer, she could see her own reflection in them - a sight that made her pulse quicken unexpectedly.

Right now... this isn't so terrible.

Nathan's chest tightened with emotion. Before he could stop himself, his fingers intertwined with hers in a possessive grip. The sudden contact made Evelyn's breath hitch.

Why is he holding my hand out of nowhere?

Though he heard her silent question through their bond, Nathan didn't release her. Instead, he feigned nonchalance and smoothly changed the subject.

"Mother, Father, and Sophia are waiting. We should hurry." With that, he quickened his pace while maintaining their joined hands, effectively leaving their companions behind.

Only when certain they wouldn't be followed did Nathan slow to a leisurely stroll, savoring these stolen moments walking hand-in-hand with his wife. After all, three very persistent chaperones awaited them at the car.

Meanwhile, the Blackwood trio exchanged puzzled glances - what could possibly be taking the couple so long?

During the ride home, conversation inevitably turned to the Winters family scandal. The revelations spanned generations, more shocking than any aristocratic gossip in recent memory.

The Blackwoods' admiration for Evelyn grew exponentially. Without their precious Evelyn, countless lives might have been destroyed.

Yet they couldn't voice their gratitude aloud. Instead, they shot Nathan disapproving looks. Since he'd technically facilitated the truth's exposure, the Winters would likely shower him with thanks.

Tsk—he's stealing his wife's credit!

Upon arriving home, everyone dispersed to their respective social circles.

The switched-at-birth scandal had already ignited every elite circle it touched, far surpassing previous high-society gossip. Not only was the situation itself sensational, but the Winters family's indifferent response only fueled the flames.

"Madam Lydia must have teams manipulating public opinion across all social tiers," Nathan observed as he emerged from the bathroom, towel-drying his hair upon hearing Evelyn's musings.

By now, he'd practically moved into her room completely—his toiletries mingled with hers, his wardrobe gradually taking over her closet space. Their cohabitation had become an unspoken reality.

This was proof of his tireless dedication.

Done.

But to the other Quirks, it was almost embarrassing. Despite pouring his heart into this for so long, they were still just sharing a bed platonically—something no one would ever believe.

When Evelyn spotted Nathan emerging, she immediately complained, "Tell me, why are netizens still obsessed with me when tonight's scandal is so much juicier?"

Nathan leaned in to look, only to find her scrolling through social media on his work computer. Amidst the explosive drama of the Winters family's tangled web of grudges and love, her name was trending almost as much as theirs.

Truly, she was the stuff of legends.

One comment read: Evelyn, why are you always at the scene?

Another asked: How many more secrets are hidden in Evelyn’s gossip vault that we don’t know about?

A third remarked: Evelyn’s fans get front-row seats to the drama. No surprise—her scandals are wilder than fiction.

The next declared: This level of fame is what other celebs dream of. Only Evelyn’s fandom gets to party like this.

And yet another proclaimed: Evelyn is the undisputed Gossip Queen of Ancient Gregan!

Comments like these flooded the feed.

Then came a list of past incidents where Evelyn had been present when scandals broke. It seemed some labels just wouldn’t fade.

If this keeps up, people will start avoiding me at events. Sure, watching drama unfold through the system is fine, but it’s nothing like being right there in the thick of it.

Evelyn felt genuinely wronged.

Even though Nathan had already contacted Isabelle in advance to steer public opinion, it was nearly impossible to curb the fans’ enthusiasm.

He could only pat her head reassuringly. "Don’t worry. Any event you want to crash, I’ll take you."

He was, without a doubt, the first CEO to wield his power in such an unconventional way.

Evelyn burst into giggles.

The next day, the Winters family arrived bearing lavish gifts to express their gratitude toward Nathan. But he immediately redirected the praise to Evelyn, insisting it had been her idea all along.

Though Lucas hadn’t fully recovered his spirits, he still managed a smile. "No need to explain. Your devotion to your wife is legendary in our circle, so the gifts we brought were always meant for Evelyn."

And he was thorough. Having noticed Nathan’s past gift selections for Evelyn, he had chosen items perfectly tailored to her tastes—things she could cherish, yet still practical.

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't contain her delight as she examined the luxurious cars one by one that evening, her lips curling into an uncontainable grin.

Soon after, Beatrice Holloway arrived bearing gifts of gratitude for saving her life.

Days later, whispers spread like wildfire—the Bennett family was determined to prosecute Penelope Collins. It was inevitable: prison awaited her, and it wouldn’t be a brief stay.

The Reed family’s business empire had once thrived through Lucas Thornton’s connections. But when he publicly withdrew his support, their financial foundation crumbled overnight. Like rats abandoning a sinking ship, Victor Reed fled the country, leaving Penelope penniless. His sole act of mercy? Taking their daughter, Luna Morgan, who had spiraled into psychological distress from the trauma.

Penelope’s own family disowned her, claiming ignorance of her crimes and refusing any future assistance.

No one stepped forward to save her. Only rumors remained—of her daily fits of hysteria, of her unraveling mind. Yet with the Bennetts pressuring the authorities, there was no chance she’d escape punishment by feigning insanity.

With Luna gone, the crime of drugging someone fell solely on Caleb Moore, who suffered the consequences. Though eventually released, the Bennetts decided to exile him overseas—keeping him alive only because he was Richard Bennett’s last remaining bloodline.

Not long after, the Bennetts hosted a grand ceremony to formalize an adoption, a bold statement to the world: their family remained unshaken, their power unbroken.

This time, Evelyn and Nathan Blackwood attended together. The event proceeded flawlessly, devoid of scandal.

But gossip still found its way to them—courtesy of Marcus Prescott.

Though the public remained unaware, Marcus spared no thought for his father’s humiliation, sharing the news freely among friends.

Shocking. Grayson Brooks had destroyed his health chasing the illusion of restored virility. Wait—his new wife is pregnant. Why would he need those pills? Then it clicked. He’d taken them for her, but the lingering effects backfired spectacularly once he stopped. Tsk. Tsk. Evelyn’s mind raced with implications.

Marcus sneered. "His body’s ruined. Not impotent, but he’ll never father another child. His only heirs are me and that unborn baby. He’s lost to everyone else forever. Karma, don’t you think?"

"Don’t say that," Vivian Grant chided, her tone sharp.

Marcus quickly softened under her reproach.

The others hesitated to comment but couldn’t resist wondering—would the wedding still proceed as planned, given his hospitalization?

Marcus shrugged. "No idea."

Later, it was confirmed: the ceremony was postponed a week—Adriana Laurent wasn’t feeling well.

The morning sun filtered through the silk curtains of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, casting a golden glow over the luxurious bedroom. Nestled among plush pillows, Evelyn absently traced circles on her slightly rounded belly, a secret she had yet to share with the world. Pregnancy had forced her to trade her usual whirlwind schedule of red carpets and exclusive parties for quiet mornings at home—a change she was still adjusting to.

Her phone buzzed incessantly on the nightstand, a relentless stream of notifications from her assistant, Lillian Graves. With a sigh, Evelyn reached for it, scrolling through the latest Hollywood headlines. A smirk tugged at her lips as she spotted a particularly juicy piece about Seraphina Delacroix's latest scandal—another messy breakup, this time with Sebastian Hart.

"Honestly, Seraphina," Evelyn murmured to herself, shaking her head. "You’d think she’d learn by now."

Just then, the door creaked open, and Nathan Blackwood strode in, his tailored suit immaculate as always. His sharp gaze softened when it landed on her. "Still in bed?" he teased, perching on the edge of the mattress. "I thought the great Evelyn Sinclair never slept past eight."

She shot him a mock glare. "Blame your child. I’m officially on bed rest, according to my doctor."

Nathan’s expression turned serious as he gently brushed a stray curl from her face. "You’re sure you’re okay with keeping this quiet for now?"

Evelyn hesitated. The media would have a field day if they found out—Nathan Blackwood, Hollywood’s most elusive bachelor, was not only off the market but expecting a baby with the infamous "Gossip Queen" herself. The thought of the headlines made her stomach churn—or maybe that was just morning sickness.

"For now," she conceded. "But I’m not hiding forever. The second this baby’s born, I’m giving the world the exclusive of the century."

Nathan chuckled, leaning down to press a kiss to her forehead. "Of course you are."

Before he could say more, Evelyn’s phone lit up again—this time with a call from Preston Whitmore. She groaned. "If this is about another script rewrite, I swear—"

Nathan snatched the phone before she could answer. "Not today," he said firmly, silencing the call. "You’re officially off-duty."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Since when do you get to decide my schedule?"

"Since you decided to carry my child," he shot back, smirking.

She rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. Instead, she settled back against the pillows, watching as Nathan moved to the window, his silhouette framed by the Los Angeles skyline. A rare moment of peace—one she knew wouldn’t last.

Because in Evelyn Sinclair’s world, secrets never stayed buried for long.

And this one?

It was the biggest of them all.

###Chapter 295: The Wager's Reckoning
Reading Evelyn's Gossip in Her Mind
The morning sun cast a golden glow over the penthouse as Evelyn Sinclair stretched lazily in bed. Her phone buzzed incessantly—another flood of notifications from the tabloids. With a sigh, she grabbed it and skimmed the headlines.

"Nathan Blackwood Spotted with Mystery Woman at Midnight Gala!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Again? She knew better than to believe every rumor, but the photos were hard to ignore. Nathan, ever the enigmatic billionaire, had his arm draped around a stunning brunette in a backless emerald gown.

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Should I text him?

No. She tossed the phone aside. They weren’t that kind of couple—if they were even a couple at all. Their relationship was a carefully curated dance of public appearances and private distance.

A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Lillian Graves, her ever-efficient assistant, peeked in. "Victoria Hayes is here. She says it’s urgent."

Evelyn groaned. Victoria, Nathan’s sharp-tongued secretary, was the last person she wanted to see. "Tell her I’m busy."

Lillian hesitated. "She mentioned something about… Seraphina Delacroix?"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. Seraphina—the actress who’d been linked to Nathan years ago, before Evelyn entered the picture. The woman who still haunted tabloid columns as "the one who got away."

"Fine," Evelyn muttered, slipping into a silk robe. "Send her in."

Victoria strode in, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. "Morning, Evelyn. Lovely to see you ignoring the press again."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "What do you want?"

Victoria smirked, tossing a glossy magazine onto the bed. The cover featured Nathan and Seraphina, their faces inches apart. "Thought you should see this before the real storm hits."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "Photos can be staged."

"True," Victoria conceded. "But can this?" She pulled out her phone and played a video—Nathan whispering something into Seraphina’s ear, her laughing, his hand lingering on her waist.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

Victoria leaned in, her voice dripping with faux sympathy. "He’s always had a soft spot for her. Maybe you should ask him about their history."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thanks for the concern, but I think I’ll handle my relationship my way."

Victoria shrugged. "Suit yourself. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."

As the door clicked shut, Evelyn exhaled sharply. She snatched her phone and dialed Nathan’s number.

It went straight to voicemail.

Of course.

She stared at the magazine cover, her mind racing. Was this just another game to test her? Or was there truth behind the rumors?

One thing was certain—she wouldn’t wait around to find out.

Grabbing her keys, she headed for the door. If Nathan wanted to play, she’d play better.

And this time, she’d make sure everyone was watching.

Mr. Brooks was utterly terrified, which explained his sudden departure abroad for medical treatment. His obsession with fathering a child had reached new heights. Now that he'd found a woman willing to bear his heir, he couldn’t risk any complications.

When the truth came to light, the Blackwood family exchanged silent glances, their thoughts clear: What throne is he trying to secure?

At this point, it seemed hopeless.

The Blackwoods didn’t dwell on it—just a postponed wedding, after all. No juicy gossip had surfaced, so their interest waned quickly.

What was intriguing, however, was Evelyn’s recent behavior. She’d been unusually busy, tight-lipped about her activities.

Only Nathan remained unsettled by it.

Then, one evening, as he stepped out of the shower, he was met with Evelyn’s radiant grin.

Her eyes sparkled with mischief, like a cat who’d just snatched the cream. With a playful smirk, she purred, "A bet is a bet, Mr. Blackwood. Shall we begin?"

Thanks to Beatrice Holloway’s decision, Evelyn had won their wager. Now, it was time to collect.

Nathan froze, caught between reluctance and resignation, but he obediently took a seat at the vanity.

He was equal parts exasperated and helpless.

"Are you absolutely certain about this?" Nathan tried one last protest. "No alternative demands?"

He’d assumed Evelyn would want something… else from him. But no—her request was far more devious.

Gleefully, she brandished her makeup kit. "I’ve prepared everything—the dress, the wig. Violet Carter even gave me lessons. I promise, I’ll turn you into a breathtaking beauty."

Oh, this was going to be glorious. Nathan’s sharp, aristocratic features would be lethal in feminine form. His childhood photos—where Margaret had once dressed him as a little princess—were proof enough. Now, Evelyn would see the full transformation firsthand. And then? She’d get very close to this stunning "lady."

Nathan’s expression was priceless—a mix of horror and reluctant amusement. He could only blame his mother for putting such ideas in Evelyn’s head.

A week ago, while flipping through the Blackwood family album, Evelyn had stumbled upon that photo—Nathan, no older than five, in a frilly dress, his hair curled like a doll’s.

He didn’t even remember wearing a skirt as a child. He did recall Julian being subjected to Margaret’s whims, though. Apparently, their mother had a thing for dressing her sons as daughters.

But this? This was entirely Evelyn’s doing.

And Nathan was not ready.

From the adjacent room, Margaret suddenly sneezed.

"Are you catching a cold?" Richard asked, glancing up from his book.

Margaret was meticulously arranging a stack of freshly developed photographs into an album. She rubbed her nose absently. "No, not at all... Oh, Richard, look at this one. The way Nathan looks at Evelyn—it could melt any mother's heart."

Richard leaned over to examine the photo. It was a recent shot taken in the living room. Evelyn and Sophia were deep in conversation, their expressions animated. Though Nathan wasn't part of their discussion, his gaze never strayed from Evelyn. The warmth in his eyes was unmistakable, even in a still image. It was as if his entire world revolved around her.

"Nathan has changed so much, all because of Evelyn," Richard mused. "Before, he barely spent time with us, let alone indulged in idle chatter. He was always buried in work, lost in his own thoughts."

"Exactly. We owe it all to Evelyn. I always knew she was his lucky charm," Margaret chuckled, carefully tucking the photo into place. Her fingers paused as she flipped to an earlier page, landing on a picture from a year ago—when the tension between the two had been palpable.

As Margaret studied Evelyn’s face across different photos, something struck her as odd. She flipped back and forth, comparing them. Though the features were identical, the expressions belonged to two entirely different people.

Her son, too, appeared transformed—once cold and distant, now hopelessly smitten. But as his mother, Margaret recognized both versions of Nathan. With Evelyn, however... Perhaps it was simply because she didn’t understand her as deeply as a mother would.

Then, her fingers brushed against the very first page, where a faded childhood photo caught her eye.

It was a rare shot of Nathan actually looking at the camera—or rather, at the person behind it.

The photo was imperfect, the top-right corner slightly obscured. It had been taken by Evelyn as a child, her first attempt with a camera. Her tiny fingers had accidentally slipped over the lens mid-shot.

The reason Evelyn had insisted on taking the photo was pure mischief. She had begged Nathan to wear one of her dresses, determined to capture the moment.

And so, there he was—dressed in a frilly blue gown, his jet-black hair tied with a matching lace ribbon. His lips were cherry-red, his teeth pearl-white. In that moment, he could’ve passed for a stunning little girl.

Evelyn had hugged him gleefully afterward, as if he were her favorite doll.

The memory sparked a mischievous thought in Margaret. She’d always harbored a secret desire to dress her son in feminine attire, but Nathan had stubbornly refused. So, she’d turned her attention to Julian instead.

Now that they were all grown up, those playful days were long gone.

Margaret sighed with regret, completely unaware that her daughter-in-law was currently having the time of her life.

In front of the vanity mirror, Nathan Blackwood sat patiently as layer after layer of makeup was applied to his face—a process that had already taken nearly an hour. His discomfort grew with each passing minute, and finally, he couldn’t hold back any longer.

“Aren’t your arms exhausted?” Nathan asked, his voice laced with concern. “If you really want me dolled up like this, we could always call in a professional makeup artist—”

“Absolutely not!” Evelyn Sinclair cut him off, her fingers still delicately blending blush across his cheekbones. “Do you really think I’d let anyone else see you like this, Mr. Blackwood? You lost the bet fair and square, but I won’t humiliate you in front of others.”

Though the situation was undeniably embarrassing, Nathan was more preoccupied with Evelyn’s well-being. She rarely wore makeup herself, let alone applied it on someone else. This was essentially a crash course in cosmetics, and while he had initially indulged her enthusiasm, the moment he noticed the slight tremble in her wrist, he had to speak up.

But before he could, her inner voice whispered through his thoughts.

Besides, how could I ever let another woman touch Nathan’s face so freely?

The words struck him like lightning. His pulse quickened, and for a moment, he was rendered speechless.

Right. Only Evelyn has that privilege.

Finally, the makeup was complete, the wig secured, and Evelyn stepped back to admire her handiwork.

Nathan opened his eyes and met her stunned gaze.

Instantly, self-consciousness prickled at him. “Is it that bad?”

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed a delicate pink, her eyes sparkling with barely contained excitement. “Hurry up and change,” she urged, nudging him toward the bed.

Nathan had already showered earlier and was wrapped in a plush bathrobe. The “women’s clothing” Evelyn had prepared for him turned out to be an elegant silk nightgown—simple yet sophisticated. The moment he slipped it on, the unfamiliar fabric made his skin prickle with discomfort. But when he reclined against the pillows, the blankets artfully concealing the broad lines of his masculine frame, the illusion was nearly flawless.

He looked like a goddess—ethereal, untouchable, a rare bloom resting atop a mountain peak.

If Isabelle Laurent were to see him now, she’d be on her knees begging him to sign a modeling contract.

No acting skills required. No professional training. His face alone was enough to captivate.

Evelyn scrambled for her phone, frantically searching for the perfect angle. Nathan, utterly clueless about posing, simply followed her directions, his expression a mix of amusement and resignation.

Ah, it doesn’t matter if he’s a man or a woman—Nathan’s beauty is simply otherworldly.

“Darling, here I come!” Evelyn giggled before tossing her phone aside and launching herself at him.

###Chapter 296 A Kiss

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She traced her fingers over the bolded title—Midnight Whispers—her latest project with Preston Whitmore.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn, we have a problem," Lillian Graves announced, stepping inside with a tablet in hand. Her assistant's usually composed demeanor was frayed at the edges.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What now?"

Lillian hesitated before swiping the screen. "Nathan Blackwood just announced his engagement."

The words hit like a physical blow. Evelyn's fingers tightened around the script, creasing the edges. "To whom?"

"Victoria Hayes."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. Of course. The woman who had schemed behind her back for months had finally gotten what she wanted.

Lillian bit her lip. "The press is already calling it the wedding of the year. They're speculating it's a rebound after you two—"

"I don't care what they're saying," Evelyn cut in, though the lie burned her throat. She turned toward the window, her reflection a ghostly silhouette against the city skyline.

A notification chimed on Lillian's tablet. She paled. "Oh no."

Evelyn didn't need to ask. The headline glared back at them:

"Blackwood's Fiancée Drops Bombshell: 'Evelyn Sinclair Was Never Right for Him.'"

Her phone buzzed—Serena Whitmore, her agent.

Evelyn ignored it. Instead, she reached for her coat.

"Where are you going?" Lillian asked, alarmed.

"To remind Nathan Blackwood exactly what he's losing."

The Blackwood Enterprises lobby was all marble and muted elegance, but Evelyn stormed through it like a hurricane. The receptionist gasped as she bypassed security, heels clicking with lethal precision toward the private elevator.

Nathan's office door swung open before she could knock.

He stood there, immaculate in a tailored suit, his icy gaze locking onto hers. "Evelyn."

She stepped inside, letting the door slam behind her. "Congratulations are in order, I hear."

His jaw tightened. "It's not what you think."

"Isn't it?" She advanced, her voice a razor's edge. "Tell me, Nathan—was it always part of the plan? String me along until Victoria secured her position?"

His eyes darkened. "You know damn well that's not true."

"Then explain it to me." She crossed her arms, nails digging into her sleeves. "Because from where I'm standing, you just handed my heart to your scheming secretary on a silver platter."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "I had no choice."

Evelyn laughed, the sound hollow. "There's always a choice."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.

Then—

A knock.

Victoria's saccharine voice floated through the door. "Nathan, darling? The press conference is starting."

Evelyn's smile was lethal. "Don't keep your fiancée waiting."

She turned to leave, but Nathan caught her wrist. His grip was firm, his voice low. "This isn't over."

Evelyn wrenched free. "Oh, it is."

And with that, she walked out—leaving behind the shattered pieces of what they'd once had.

Outside Blackwood Enterprises

Lillian rushed forward. "What happened?"

Evelyn didn't answer. Instead, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number she hadn't touched in months.

Preston Whitmore answered on the first ring. "Evelyn?"

Her voice was steel. "I'm in. Midnight Whispers starts filming next week."

A pause. Then, a slow smile in his tone. "I'll have the contracts ready."

She hung up, staring at the Blackwood tower one last time.

If Nathan wanted a war, she'd give him one.

Perhaps it was the way Nathan looked so unexpectedly soft in the silken nightgown, his usual sharp edges blurred into something delicate and inviting. Evelyn found herself drawn to him like a moth to flame. Before she could stop herself, she tumbled onto the bed, landing squarely atop the breathtaking vision that was Nathan Blackwood.

The impact forced a quiet grunt from him, but once the surprise faded, his arms wrapped around her with effortless affection. His warmth seeped through the thin fabric, and Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity—here was a man who could command boardrooms with a glance, now draped in lace and silk beneath her.

She propped herself up, studying his face. The usual icy detachment in his gaze had melted into something tender, something hers. A wicked grin curled her lips. "Such a beauty," she declared, tracing the line of his jaw. "You have to be my wife."

Who else could claim both the most devastatingly handsome husband and the most ethereal wife? Only her.

Nathan’s breath hitched. The way she looked at him—playful, possessive—sent a tremor through his chest. His pulse roared in his ears, loud enough that Evelyn could feel it where she pressed against him.

Then, without warning, the world tilted.

Evelyn’s lips met his in a kiss that tasted of winter mint and something infinitely sweeter. The contrast between the cool balm on her mouth and the heat of his skin was intoxicating. For a heartbeat, their breaths tangled, and Nathan swore he felt her soul brush against his.

Fire licked through his veins. Every muscle in his body coiled tight, a predator poised to strike—yet he held himself perfectly still. Afraid to move. Afraid to shatter the illusion.

But the pressure vanished as quickly as it came.

Nathan’s eyes flew open, chasing her retreat. His hands flexed against the sheets, aching to pull her back.

Evelyn, however, was already scrambling upright, cheeks flushed. "I—" Her voice wavered. "That was—"

Nathan didn’t let her finish. In one fluid motion, he caught her wrist and tugged her down again.

This time, he kissed her.

The world dissolved into heat and hunger.

When they finally broke apart, Evelyn’s lips were swollen, her breathing ragged. Nathan’s thumb traced the curve of her bottom lip, his voice a rough whisper.

"Do you prefer men," he murmured, "or women?"

The question hung between them, charged and unreadable.

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered.

What kind of answer was that?

Nathan's eyes gleamed with intensity, his Adam's apple bobbing slightly as he swallowed hard. "Is that so? I was... concerned for a moment..."

His words dissolved into the warmth of their joined lips once more.

Evelyn's eyes flew open in shock, a visible tremor running through her. This time, her surprise was even more profound than before. The first kiss had happened in a haze of confusion, with the man before her feeling almost like a dream.

But now—this was undeniably real. Fully conscious, completely aware, she was being drawn into Nathan's embrace.

It was just a simple brush of lips, yet it sent fireworks exploding through her chest.

When Evelyn finally regained her senses, she heard his deep, velvety voice—laced with barely contained amusement, though he tried to sound indifferent. "Well," he murmured, "now I'm not worried anymore."

She couldn't remember how she had fallen asleep. The next morning, when she stirred, the usual good-morning peck on her forehead was replaced by something far lighter—a feather-soft kiss on her lips. The tickling sensation made her instinctively lick her own lips, and she swore she heard a quiet, stifled gulp.

Still half-asleep, Evelyn sensed something dangerous in the air. She curled deeper into the blankets, drifting back into peaceful dreams.

Nathan, however, had no choice but to retreat to the bathroom before they could finally leave.

Their progress was slow—distractingly so.

But the day of the Burke family wedding was fast approaching.

Even though Ralph had no hope of fathering children, the ceremony would proceed as planned.

That evening, the family gathered in the living room, discussing their plans for the next day’s event. Evelyn, however, was distracted. Vivian had been blowing up her phone, messages flooding in one after another.

At first, Evelyn thought it was an emergency. But when she opened the chat, the first message read:

"Do you know what’s going on between Marcus and Vivian?"

Evelyn frowned. Scrolling up, she realized Vivian and Beatrice had recently contacted Vivian Grant about wedding gifts. Though they managed to reach her, the usually lively and talkative Vivian had been unusually brief, her tone weak and distant. She barely responded to messages—something was off.

Evelyn wanted to reply, "You’ve known her for years. If you don’t know, how would I?"

But before she could type a word, another message popped up:

"Gossip queen, spill. What’s the tea?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

She tossed her phone to Nathan. After a moment of thought, he remarked, "Marcus hasn’t been around much lately. Seems preoccupied."

That immediately caught the family’s attention.

"What’s going on?" Cassandra asked, leaning forward.

Nathan shrugged. "No idea. But something’s definitely up."

The room buzzed with speculation, but Evelyn’s mind was elsewhere—lingering on the memory of that kiss.

And the way Nathan had looked at her afterward.

Like he’d been waiting for that moment forever.

Meanwhile, Evelyn seized the chance to access the system, her fingers flying across the screen as she pulled up the latest updates.

What in the world is going on? Let me see… Wait, what?

COMPLETE.

The entire household stiffened at once. What now? Was there actually some explosive gossip? Could it be about Marcus’s father being infertile?

Holy hell, this can’t be real!

Mrs. Laurent had suffered a miscarriage—and it was no accident. Vivian was behind it. Mr. Brooks still had no idea his last hope for an heir had been destroyed. And now, with his inability to conceive, he clung even tighter to his remaining child. Both Marcus and Vivian knew the truth: if Mr. Brooks ever found out, all hell would break loose.

###Chapter 297 The Weight of Your Shadow

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She exhaled sharply, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. The weight of the decision pressed on her chest like an invisible hand.

Should she take the role or not?

Her phone buzzed—another message from Preston Whitmore, the director of Midnight Whispers, the film that could redefine her career.

Preston: Evelyn, we need your answer by noon. The studio’s getting impatient.

She bit her lip. The script was brilliant, but the male lead… Nathan Blackwood. Just the thought of working with him again sent a shiver down her spine. Their last collaboration had ended in disaster—a whirlwind of tabloid scandals, heated arguments, and an unresolved tension that still lingered between them.

A knock at the door startled her.

“Evelyn?” Lillian Graves, her assistant, peeked in, holding a tray with coffee and a croissant. “You haven’t eaten. And you look like you’ve been wrestling with ghosts all night.”

Evelyn forced a smile. “Just scripts and decisions.”

Lillian set the tray down. “Is this about Midnight Whispers?”

Evelyn nodded. “Nathan’s already signed on.”

Lillian’s eyes widened. “Oh.”

Oh indeed.

Evelyn picked up the script again, flipping to the scene where her character would have to confront Nathan’s—a raw, emotionally charged moment that mirrored their real-life history too closely.

“What if I can’t do it?” she murmured.

Lillian hesitated before speaking. “Or… what if this is exactly what you both need?”

Evelyn’s phone buzzed again—this time, a notification from Celebrity Insider.

BREAKING: Nathan Blackwood Spotted Leaving a Late-Night Meeting with Vanessa Sterling—Is There Trouble in Paradise?

Her stomach twisted. Vanessa Sterling—Harrison Montgomery’s infamous mistress. What was Nathan doing with her?

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen, torn between calling Preston to decline or texting Nathan for an explanation she had no right to demand.

Then her doorbell rang.

Lillian frowned. “Are you expecting someone?”

Evelyn stood, smoothing her silk robe. “No.”

She opened the door—and froze.

Nathan stood there, his dark eyes stormy, his jaw set. “We need to talk.”

Behind her, Lillian discreetly slipped out, leaving them in the charged silence of the penthouse.

Evelyn crossed her arms. “About what? Your midnight rendezvous with Vanessa?”

Nathan’s expression darkened. “It’s not what you think.”

“Then enlighten me.”

He stepped closer, his voice low. “Not here. Not like this.” His gaze flickered to the script on her table. “You’re considering the role.”

She lifted her chin. “And if I am?”

Nathan exhaled sharply. “Then we’re about to have one hell of a reunion.”

The air between them crackled—old wounds, unspoken words, and the undeniable pull that had always existed beneath the surface.

Evelyn’s pulse raced.

Damn him.

She had a choice: walk away and protect her heart… or step into the fire and risk everything.

And Nathan Blackwood had always been her greatest risk.

The Blackwood family stood frozen, the gravity of the situation pressing down on them like a suffocating weight. Given the Prescott family’s notorious obsession with lineage, and considering Marcus’s current state of health… if this got out, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Vivian had inadvertently become the reason for the loss of her future brother-in-law and sister-in-law. What should have been a union of families through marriage had instead sown seeds of resentment.

Everyone in the Blackwood household understood this was nothing more than a tragic accident. How could fate twist so cruelly?

All they wanted was to prevent any misunderstanding between Marcus and Vivian.

From Nathan’s understanding of Marcus, he knew the one likely to struggle wouldn’t be Marcus, but Vivian herself.

Evelyn and Nathan were thinking the same thing.

Given Vivian’s nature, she was probably drowning in guilt, consumed by remorse toward Marcus. Marcus didn’t want her to suffer, so he insisted she stay home while he handled everything. At the moment, he was at the hospital with Adriana, praying she would recover enough before their wedding. He couldn’t risk anyone discovering her recent miscarriage. He had already made Adriana swear to secrecy—at least until after the ceremony. They’d figure out the rest later.

The Blackwoods exchanged bewildered glances. They had assumed that, regardless of Adriana’s relationship with Marcus and the others, she would never agree to cover up something like this. Was she truly that selfless?

A saint?

Evelyn found it hard to believe. The rumors she’d heard from Vivian about Adriana had painted a very different picture. Suspicion prickled at her.

Under normal circumstances, a woman in Adriana’s position—married to a man like Grayson, whose reputation for discarding wives was well-known—would cling to a child as her only security. So why was she so willing to cooperate with Marcus?

Nathan had reached the same conclusion. Perhaps Adriana had no other choice. Without a child, Grayson’s fickle nature meant she could be cast aside at any moment. Keeping this quiet and securing the marriage first was her best option.

But with such a scandal unfolding right before the wedding… did this mean tomorrow’s ceremony was doomed?

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

The tension in the Blackwood household was palpable. A new bride suffering a miscarriage—especially one caused by their son’s partner—wasn’t something anyone could easily brush aside.

Would Marcus really be able to smooth things over?

The air thickened with unspoken dread.

The long-awaited wedding day arrived, filling Evelyn with a mix of curiosity and unease.

As the Blackwood family stepped into the venue, they were met with an unexpected sight—far more guests than anyone had anticipated.

Grayson Brooks had been married multiple times before, and most high-society figures had long grown tired of attending his ceremonies. Usually, they’d simply send gifts as a polite gesture.

But this time? The place was packed.

"What’s going on?" Richard murmured, eyebrows raised.

Margaret tilted her head. "Since when did Grayson become so popular?"

Nathan’s sister, Sophia, had brought her son Theodore along since he was off school. While Sophia looked around in confusion, Theodore, ever observant, leaned in. "A lot of people keep glancing at us."

The children assumed it was because of Nathan and Evelyn’s fame—they were quite the power couple.

But the adults knew better. Their gazes slowly shifted toward Evelyn.

Evelyn blinked innocently.

Is it because they heard I’d be here? That’s ridiculous.

"Wow, what a crowd," she remarked.

Vivian Moore chuckled. "Seems like word got out that Evelyn Sinclair would be here today. Everyone’s trying to catch a glimpse."

"Deliberate chaos, isn’t it?" Beatrice Holloway added dryly.

Vivian stuck out her tongue playfully before greeting the relatives who had arrived before them.

"Evelyn, your influence has officially surpassed your husband’s," Vivian teased.

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "You can have the spotlight."

How did I end up the center of attention at someone else’s wedding? Now I can’t even enjoy the drama properly. This is infuriating.

Hearing her unspoken complaint, the Blackwoods barely suppressed their laughter.

Amidst the chatter, they made their way inside, where Grayson stood at the entrance with a smug smile. Beside him was a young man who bore a striking resemblance—but it wasn’t Marcus Prescott.

"Of course," Vivian muttered under her breath. "Marcus would never play host for his playboy father."

Evelyn’s curiosity piqued.

This wedding just got a lot more interesting.

By now, all the guests had exchanged pleasantries with the host.

It was only then that Evelyn recognized the young man standing beside Grayson—the one who had replaced Marcus.

Good heavens, the Burke family patriarch is truly something else. This man, who appeared to be around the same age as Marcus, was actually Marcus’s younger uncle, Liam—Grayson’s youngest brother. Judging by his restless demeanor, it seemed he had been roped into being a groomsman, given that all his older siblings were already inside as guests, leaving him alone to attend to the others.

Once they stepped into the venue, they spotted Daniel and Lucas in the distance, waving at them. They had arrived early.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered between Lucas and Beatrice for a brief moment, noticing something different. It was in Lucas’s eyes. Before, they would never linger on Beatrice, but now, he was staring at her openly.

Yet, despite both of them having left the Winters manor together, they weren’t acting as a pair. It seemed Beatrice had some inexplicable resistance toward this adoptive older brother.

Evelyn gave them a quick glance before her attention was swiftly drawn elsewhere.

At that moment, Vivian was sitting with them. Unusually, among the group, Vivian was visible—but Marcus was nowhere to be seen.

Vivian’s expression was slightly dazed, her complexion paler than usual. She looked as though she had lost weight.

One glance was enough to tell that something was off with her.

Though Daniel and Lucas had arrived first and had already asked what was wrong, Vivian hadn’t been willing to answer. Given that they were men, pressing further would have been inappropriate.

As the others arrived, Daniel and Lucas exchanged knowing glances with everyone.

Apart from Evelyn and Nathan, no one else knew the truth. So, Vivian Moore casually asked, "What’s going on? You’ve been acting strange lately. Did you and Marcus have a fight?"

Vivian forced a weak smile. "Don’t jump to conclusions. I’m fine… I just didn’t sleep well last night."

"Darling, you’ve got too much on your mind. I’ll just ask Marcus later," Vivian Moore said, not wanting to make Vivian uncomfortable. "Speaking of which, where is Marcus? He’s not at the entrance, and he’s not guarding his darling either. What’s he up to?"

The moment those words left her lips, subtle shifts flickered across Daniel and Lucas’s expressions.

Vivian Moore immediately tensed. "What happened?"

"Nothing serious. His new stepmother called him away," Daniel said with a laugh, quickly regaining his usual composure.

"What’s going on?" Vivian Moore pressed, sensing something amiss.

Vivian, meanwhile, seemed lost in thought, her fingers absently twisting the fabric of her dress.

###Chapter 298: The Stepmother's Secret

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered scripts on her coffee table. She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair as she reread the latest revisions for the hundredth time.

This role could change everything.

Her phone buzzed—another message from Preston Whitmore, the director.

Preston: Evelyn, we need your final decision by noon. The studio is breathing down my neck.

She bit her lip. The project was risky—a psychological thriller that demanded raw vulnerability. But after years of being typecast as the charming romantic lead, this was her chance to prove she could do more.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Come in," she called.

Lillian Graves, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You’re a lifesaver."

Lillian hesitated. "Nathan Blackwood just called. He wants to meet you."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Nathan—Hollywood’s most enigmatic leading man, the man she’d secretly admired for years. The man whose last film had shattered box office records.

"Why?" she asked, trying to sound casual.

Lillian shrugged. "He didn’t say. But he mentioned it was about your new project."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her coffee cup. Nathan never involved himself in other actors’ projects. Unless…

Unless he wanted in.

Her mind raced. If Nathan joined the cast, the film would get instant credibility—and a guaranteed audience. But working with him meant long hours, intense scenes, and the kind of chemistry that could blur the lines between fiction and reality.

She exhaled sharply.

"Tell him I’ll meet him. But not at his usual spots—somewhere neutral."

Lillian nodded, already typing into her phone. "There’s a quiet café downtown. No paparazzi, no fans."

Evelyn glanced at the script again, her stomach fluttering.

This meeting could change everything.

Or ruin it all.

Nathan had always been perceptive. The moment he saw their expressions, he knew they were hiding something.

It might not be anything serious, but the way Lucas and Daniel exchanged glances when Adriana came looking for Marcus told him something was off.

Marcus had been whispering sweet nothings to Vivian just moments ago, their heads bent close together. Lucas and Daniel assumed Vivian was upset about something—maybe a lovers' quarrel—so naturally, they didn’t pry.

But then Adriana, the radiant bride herself, sought Marcus out, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she pouted, "I’ve been searching everywhere for you. Why weren’t you answering your phone?"

Her voice dripped with such honeyed sweetness that Lucas and Daniel shuddered. If they didn’t know better, they’d think Adriana was Marcus’s girlfriend, not his stepmother.

Marcus stiffened, but unlike Lucas and Daniel, neither he nor Vivian reacted with shock. There was something unspoken between them—a secret they carried in silence.

"What’s wrong?" Marcus asked, his voice carefully neutral.

"I don’t feel well," Adriana murmured, pressing a delicate hand to her temple. "I’m worried. Could you come with me?"

A flicker of something unreadable passed over Marcus’s face. Without another word, he stood and followed her.

The sight left Lucas speechless.

What the hell is Adriana playing at? If she was feeling unwell, she should’ve gone to her husband, Grayson. The way she looked at Marcus—like he was the only one who could save her—was downright bizarre.

And Marcus’s reaction? Even stranger. He’d never shown the slightest interest in any of his stepmothers before. Why was Adriana different? Was it just because she might be carrying his half-sibling?

Lucas glanced at Vivian, expecting fury or at least irritation. But she just sat there, eerily calm.

Are we overreacting?

Before they could dwell on it, Evelyn—who had been watching the entire scene with amusement—leaned in, her lips curling into a smirk. By then, Nathan and the rest of the Blackwood family had noticed too.

They exchanged uneasy glances. Something wasn’t right, but they couldn’t outright accuse Adriana and Marcus of anything inappropriate. The circumstances were complicated enough already.

Then, out of nowhere, Vivian Moore—ever the blunt one—dropped the bomb.

"What’s the deal here?" she drawled, arching a brow. "Why does this stepmother keep dragging her stepson into everything? Did she marry the father or the son? Or is there something else going on?"

Beatrice Holloway, mid-sip of her coffee, choked.

Lucas hastily handed her a napkin.

Beatrice shot Vivian a withering glare, but the damage was done. The air thickened with tension, and unspoken questions hung heavy in the room.

What exactly was happening between Adriana and Marcus?

And why did Vivian seem… unbothered by it?

"It's quite common abroad for step-relatives to get involved with each other," Vivian smirked, her tone dripping with amusement. "Besides, there's no blood relation between them."

Nathan's actions were questionable, and considering they were around the same age, it was only natural to avoid suspicion. The whole situation was inappropriate from the start. What baffled Evelyn even more was Marcus. Since when had he become so polite? Instead of helping his father greet the guests at the door, he ignored his girlfriend and meddled in his stepmother’s affairs. That wasn’t like him at all. Something was definitely off.

Under normal circumstances, Evelyn would have eagerly gossiped with Vivian about Marcus and Adriana. But they knew the truth—Marcus had only cooperated because of the miscarriage incident. It wouldn’t be fair to accuse him now. All they could do was listen and exchange knowing glances.

After finishing her piece, Vivian didn’t care about the stunned expressions around her. She reached out and pulled Vivian Grant into a tight, reassuring hug. "Vivian, don’t worry. If Marcus dares to wrong you, we’ll stand up for you!"

Catching her breath from the suffocating embrace, Vivian waved her hands frantically. "No, you’ve misunderstood!"

Vivian shrugged. "Let’s hope I’m overthinking it."

Vivian Grant, despite the overwhelming urge to deny everything, suddenly froze as if struck by a realization. Her pupils trembled slightly before she finally spoke with firm conviction. "Marcus wouldn’t do something like that!"

That’s odd. Is she suspecting something between Marcus and Adriana too? Evelyn couldn’t help but wonder. After all, a girlfriend’s intuition was often right.

Evelyn’s inner thoughts caught the attention of the Blackwoods, who stood nearby.

There’s something going on between Marcus and Adriana? Is it what we think it is? Is he not treating her differently because of the miscarriage?

Just then, Evelyn’s thoughts continued. Whoa! What? A photo?

The Blackwoods were instantly intrigued, even Nathan pausing mid-motion as he adjusted his wife’s coat.

Evelyn’s thoughts spilled out. That photo must have been taken years ago—Adriana and Marcus sitting together, sharing drinks. Vivian wanted to confirm if it was really him in the picture, so she grabbed Adriana’s hand, the one holding the phone. The sudden movement startled Adriana, causing her to fall and tragically miscarry. In the chaos, Vivian forgot about the photo. Now, it’s resurfacing in her mind, making her question whether Marcus was telling the truth when he claimed he didn’t know Adriana.

Nathan frowned. They knew each other?

The other Blackwoods were equally shocked. Is Adriana Marcus’s ex-girlfriend? How dramatic.

If Marcus deceived her, she’d be heartbroken. She still remembers how Adriana sobbed, curled up in Marcus’s arms, trembling as she whispered his name and murmured, "My child… oh, my child…" Vivian can’t shake that scene, but she doesn’t know how to feel about it. After all, she’s the so-called culprit responsible for the death of an innocent child. The guilt weighs on her, making it hard to focus on anything else.

The Blackwoods were speechless. This sounds like something straight out of a soap opera.

Nathan, clueless about intricate emotions, simply thought that if he were in Marcus’s shoes, he’d find Adriana bothersome and would want nothing to do with her.

Evelyn let out a weary sigh. Why does Adriana seem so insincere? From Marcus's reaction, it was clear he had no recollection of her. He was only humoring Adriana out of fear she might expose Vivian.

The Blackwoods exchanged relieved glances. Good. There's nothing between them.

Nathan, however, remained skeptical. He knew Evelyn's Gossip System was subjective. If Marcus genuinely didn’t remember Adriana—or believed he’d never met her—then to him, she was just another stranger.

It was like passing someone on the street. Adriana hadn’t left an impression on Marcus, so he didn’t recognize her. Yet, Adriana remembered him vividly, convinced they shared a past. Worse, there were photos of them together—proof that complicated everything.

Vivian shifted uncomfortably before abruptly standing. "Excuse me," she murmured, heading toward Marcus.

Her unease unsettled everyone. They’d watched this couple fight for their love, and now they wanted to protect it. Silently, they resolved to pull Marcus aside later and remind him to be mindful of his relationship with his stepmother.

Meanwhile, Marcus stood frozen, staring at the woman before him. Her pleading gaze made his stomach twist. Disbelieving, he dug a finger into his ear. "What did you just say? Did I mishear you?"

Adriana’s eyes brimmed with sorrow. "Must you pretend not to understand? Fine, I’ll spell it out. I want you to give me another child. That’s the only way we can keep this secret."

At that exact moment, Evelyn tuned in through her system. Let me check if they’ve reached a decision— Her thoughts screeched to a halt. Oh my God!

Her shock rippled through the Blackwoods. What the hell is happening?!

They do have a past! She wants to have a baby with her stepson?! Evelyn’s mind reeled.

The Blackwoods’ mental outcry was deafening. WHAT?! We must—

###Chapter 299: Obsessed With Marcus

Eavesdropping on Scandalous Thoughts

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. She lounged on her velvet chaise, sipping her matcha latte, when an unexpected wave of thoughts crashed into her mind.

"Oh my god, did you hear? Nathan Blackwood was seen leaving Seraphina Delacroix’s apartment at 3 AM last night!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink. That voice—sharp, gossipy, unmistakably belonging to Lillian Graves, her ever-dramatic assistant. But Lillian wasn’t even in the room.

Then another voice, hushed but dripping with intrigue: "I bet Victoria Hayes had something to do with it. That woman’s been scheming since day one."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her cup. Since when could she hear people’s private thoughts? And why were they all about him?

A third voice, smooth and amused, slithered into her mind—Nathan’s. "If only Evelyn knew how badly I want to kiss her right now."

Her face flamed. What the hell?

Before she could process it, her phone buzzed. A text from Preston Whitmore: "Emergency meeting. Studio in 30. Bring your poker face."

Evelyn groaned. As if her day couldn’t get weirder.

Marcus never imagined his private conversation with Adriana would be overheard by Evelyn. Otherwise, he would have died from embarrassment right then and there.

The sheer mortification was unbearable.

"Are you out of your damn mind?" Marcus snapped the moment he regained his composure.

Thankfully, his reaction was exactly what Evelyn expected. Otherwise, she might have seriously doubted his innocence.

The Blackwoods, who had been anxiously eavesdropping through Evelyn’s inner thoughts, finally exhaled in relief.

If something like that had actually happened, it would’ve been a scandal explosive enough to ruin Marcus’s reputation forever.

Wait—what?

Did Adriana just say another?

What did that even mean?

Could the previous child have been…?

Evelyn’s mind raced with horrifying possibilities.

The Blackwoods froze. Seriously?

Surprisingly, Nathan remained completely unfazed. After all, if Marcus had fathered a child, Evelyn’s system would’ve picked up on it from his perspective.

Sure enough, the next moment, they heard Evelyn’s thoughts.

Thank God. At least Marcus has only ever been with one woman—Vivian.

The Blackwoods sighed in unison.

Talk about an indirect way to prove his innocence. Who knew the Gossip System could be used like this?

Nathan smirked, recalling the time he’d been exposed as a virgin. He was eternally grateful for the Gossip System’s ability to vouch for a man’s honor. Otherwise, no one would believe him. And if doubts lingered, his wife might have looked at him differently.

After all, a man’s integrity was everything.

For some inexplicable reason, Nathan felt a surge of pride and pulled Evelyn into his arms.

But Evelyn was too engrossed in the gossip to notice.

If Marcus was innocent, then why would Adriana say such a thing?

Was it a slip of the tongue?

Ugh, this is driving me crazy. I need to see Adriana right now. What the hell is going through that woman’s mind? How could she make such an outrageous demand? Is she seriously not interested in Grayson and instead fixated on her stepson? Is she trying to stir up some twisted family drama, like one of those scandalous romance novels?

Meanwhile, Marcus was too stunned to process Adriana’s words properly.

When she mentioned another, he assumed she was talking about trying to conceive again after her miscarriage.

It never even crossed his mind that she might mean they should have another child—as if they had ever lost one together.

The sheer absurdity of it all left him speechless.

"Can't you show me even the slightest bit of compassion?" Adriana gazed at Marcus as if he were a cold-hearted monster.

Marcus shuddered, repulsed by the desperation in her eyes. He was utterly baffled, struggling to decipher Adriana’s true intentions.

Avoid confronting certain issues? He frowned. She must be referring to Vivian indirectly causing her miscarriage, expecting me to take responsibility and compensate her on Vivian’s behalf. That has to be it… What else could it be? But why approach it like this? Unless…

A chilling suspicion crept into Marcus’s mind. His expression darkened, and he instinctively took a step back.

Evelyn’s jaw nearly dropped. Oh my God, Marcus is catching on. She’s clearly aiming for both Grayson AND Marcus!

The Blackwoods exchanged excited glances. This is getting juicy. There’s nothing like witnessing a schemer’s downfall in real time.

Unaware of Marcus’s disgust, Adriana lowered her lashes, her voice trembling. "Marrying your father wasn’t my choice, but given the circumstances, I had no other option. You know how volatile he is. With his health deteriorating, if he were to find out about my miscarriage…"

Marcus’s expression flickered, but he remained silent.

Adriana pressed on, her voice thick with emotion. "The best solution would be for me to conceive again quickly—to replace what was lost."

Marcus’s eyes narrowed. "You could always turn to someone else," he suggested hastily. "I’ll keep your secret, or—" There are a dozen other ways to handle this.

Before he could finish, Adriana cut him off, her face twisting in betrayal. "How could you say that? What kind of woman do you take me for? Are you suggesting I should just sleep with random men?"

Marcus was speechless, his stomach churning.

But you’re literally trying to sleep with ME! The audacity! Poor Marcus… Evelyn internally screamed.

The Blackwoods exchanged pitying looks. This poor guy can’t catch a break.

Truthfully, Marcus’s life before college had been anything but peaceful. With a revolving door of stepmothers, each had seen him as an obstacle, scheming to remove him from the picture. He’d never gotten along with any of them—but this one was different in the worst possible way.

Nathan was certain his friend would’ve preferred the usual hostility over… this.

When Marcus stayed silent, Adriana grew impatient.

She knew a rational man would never agree to such a twisted proposal.

"This secret must stay between us," she whispered urgently. "And surely, you wouldn’t want someone else complicating your—"

"I won't compete with you for the family fortune. We could keep this secret between us forever," she coaxed, her voice dripping with honeyed persuasion.

Marcus hadn’t anticipated Adriana would actually try to justify such twisted desires with such shameless audacity.

The memory of what had happened to his friends before this moment sent an icy shiver down his spine.

What kind of madness is this? Is it suddenly fashionable to have two fathers for a child—one in name, the other by blood?

Marcus stared at Adriana in disbelief, but a delicate blush crept across her cheeks, as if she were a bashful maiden. "Don’t worry," she murmured, stepping closer. "This will stay our little secret. Just spend more time at home with me, and I’m certain I’ll conceive soon."

Before she could throw herself into his arms, Marcus sidestepped her, his expression hardening. Adriana’s eyes shimmered with wounded sorrow, her lips trembling in disappointment.

It’s confirmed. This woman is completely obsessed with me.

She wanted to kill two birds with one stone—use him to secure a bloodline the Blackwood family would never question, all while satisfying her own twisted desires.

Evelyn had pieced it together too. This deranged woman wasn’t just scheming—she was infatuated with Marcus, willing to risk everything for an illicit affair. There were countless ways she could have achieved her goals—medical procedures, surrogates, even discreet arrangements. If she truly had no feelings for him, why go to such lengths?

Why offer herself?

The Blackwoods exchanged silent glances. Adriana’s intentions were crystal clear.

Nathan, however, found the situation bizarre. Was Adriana so desperate to be with Marcus that she’d gamble everything? A miscarriage wouldn’t necessarily ruin her, but if her affair with Marcus was exposed, she’d be destroyed—while he’d walk away unscathed.

Nathan had already begun digging into Adriana’s past after hearing whispers of a suspicious photo linking her and Marcus. More information would arrive soon. He needed to warn Marcus—prepare him for what was coming.

###Chapter 300 Liam Suspects The Child Is His

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn Sinclair’s penthouse, illuminating the sleek marble countertops in her kitchen. She sipped her coffee, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp morning air. Today was the day—the final confrontation with Victoria Hayes, the woman who had orchestrated so much chaos in her life.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Lillian Graves, her ever-loyal assistant: "Everything is set. The board meeting starts in an hour. Are you ready?"

Her fingers hovered over the screen before typing back: "More than ready."

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. Nathan Blackwood stood there, his dark eyes intense, his jaw set in that familiar, determined way. "You’re not going alone," he said, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation.

Evelyn arched a brow. "I didn’t ask for backup."

Nathan smirked. "You didn’t have to."

The tension between them was electric, a silent understanding passing between them. They had been through too much—betrayals, secrets, near-death experiences—and yet, here they were, standing side by side.

Victoria Hayes had underestimated them both.

Evelyn set her coffee down. "Fine. But don’t interfere unless absolutely necessary."

Nathan’s lips twitched. "Wouldn’t dream of it."

The boardroom was packed when they arrived. Victoria sat at the head of the table, her perfectly manicured fingers steepled, a smug smile playing on her lips. "Ah, Evelyn. So nice of you to finally join us."

Evelyn didn’t bother with pleasantries. She strode forward, dropping a thick file onto the table. "Before we begin, I think everyone should see this."

Victoria’s smile faltered. "What is this?"

Evelyn flipped the file open, revealing a series of incriminating documents—emails, financial transactions, even recorded conversations. "Proof of your embezzlement, your blackmail, and your attempts to sabotage Sinclair Enterprises."

Gasps filled the room.

Victoria’s face paled, but she quickly masked her shock with a laugh. "This is absurd! These are clearly fabrications."

Nathan stepped forward, his voice low but commanding. "We have witnesses. Digital forensics. Even your own assistant has turned against you."

Victoria’s eyes darted to Lillian, who stood near the door, her expression unreadable.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "It’s over, Victoria. Resign now, or face criminal charges."

For a moment, the room was silent. Then, Victoria’s composure shattered. She slammed her hands on the table. "You think you’ve won? You have no idea what’s coming."

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "Try me."

Victoria stormed out, but the damage was done. The board members exchanged uneasy glances before one of them cleared his throat. "Ms. Sinclair… it seems we owe you an apology."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. The battle was won—but the war wasn’t over yet.

Nathan leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Told you we made a good team."

She shot him a sidelong glance. "Don’t get cocky."

His grin was infuriating. "Wouldn’t dream of it."

But as they left the boardroom, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that Victoria’s parting threat had been more than just empty words.

Something darker was coming.

And she would be ready.

Meanwhile, Marcus was utterly repulsed. The mere thought of Adriana—his stepmother who had shared his father’s bed—made his stomach churn. I’d rather walk through fire than entertain such a disgusting proposal!

Though Adriana was close to his age, she might as well have been a withered crone in Marcus’s eyes. The idea of touching her sent shivers of revulsion down his spine.

Yet Adriana had found his Achilles’ heel. She didn’t spell it out, but Marcus knew—if he refused, she’d expose the truth about Vivian’s role in her miscarriage.

If Ralph ever discovered Vivian had caused Adriana to lose the baby, Marcus had no doubt his father would unleash hell. The Brooks family prized their bloodline above all else. They’d brand Vivian a curse, a blight on their legacy, and…

Marcus’s expression darkened like a storm cloud. I won’t let Vivian suffer for this.

I need to play along—for now.

Adriana watched him with wounded doe eyes, her gaze a mix of longing and sorrow—but no anger.

“I’ll give you time to consider,” she murmured, voice trembling. “But we can’t wait forever. If we delay, suspicions will rise even if I do conceive.” She pressed a hand to her chest. “Marcus, I’ve compromised so much already. You can’t treat me like this. I have feelings too.”

Reject her! Call her out for this insanity! Evelyn’s mental scream was razor-sharp.

The Blackwoods exchanged puzzled glances. Why is Evelyn so invested in this?

Marcus’s jaw clenched. After a weighted pause, he gritted out, “Fine. I’ll think about it. You’ll have my answer after the wedding.”

Adriana’s lips curled in a fragile smile. She nodded, and Marcus bolted from the room like the hounds of hell chased him.

The Blackwoods tensed—until Evelyn’s scathing inner monologue cut through the silence.

Marcus, you absolute fool. You actually considered it?!

Nathan’s brows knitted. No. He’d never agree. He cut ties with his own father without hesitation. This makes no sense.

Then came Evelyn’s derisive mental scoff.

Oh, he’s stalling, alright. But his mind’s already made up. If push comes to shove, he’ll vanish with Vivian right after the wedding—no goodbyes, no looking back. The Brooks legacy? The fallout? He couldn’t care less. Vivian’s his only priority.

Relief washed over the Blackwoods. Smirks tugged at their lips.

Classic Marcus.

Nathan found it strange. If that were truly the case, why was Evelyn so visibly distressed?

Suddenly, he felt her stir in his arms, attempting to pull away.

Marcus had messed up! Did he not realize walls had ears? Vivian had overheard everything from the adjacent room!

The Blackwoods exchanged stunned glances. What?

Nathan recalled the mansion’s layout when they first arrived. Each upstairs room had its own balcony—wide open spaces where voices could easily carry if the doors and windows were left unsealed.

With the wedding festivities keeping everyone downstairs, the rooms remained empty. Marcus and Adriana must have known which ones were vacant, so they hadn’t bothered to close the balcony door.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor.

Marcus had left in such a hurry that he hadn’t noticed Vivian in the next room. She had been silently weeping on the balcony for some time now. No, I can’t just stand by and let this misunderstanding fester. I’ve always despised unresolved drama in those cheesy romance shows. I need to find them both and force them to confront this. Vivian is too pure-hearted—she won’t be able to hide her devastation.

The Blackwoods, too, found the situation unbearable. Though meddling in others’ affairs wasn’t their style, they couldn’t ignore this.

“I—” Evelyn was still scrambling for an excuse when Nathan spoke first. “Wherever you want to go, I’m coming with you.”

Their eyes met, and inexplicably, Evelyn felt she didn’t need to hide anything from him. “I’m going to find Vivian and Marcus,” she admitted.

Nathan… he’s someone I can trust with secrets.

The thought flickered through her mind without justification, but since he didn’t press further, she decided to let him accompany her.

With his sharp intuition, he might uncover the truth instantly. If he took the lead, no one would question how she knew things she shouldn’t.

Pulling her to her feet, Nathan smoothly excused them from the gathering, a faint smirk tugging at his lips.

Perfect. She’s starting to rely on me. That means I matter to her. This is progress.

Marcus had left with the bride, so Vivian would undoubtedly be in the bridal suite—she had come looking for him, after all. A quick inquiry led them straight to her.

She was upstairs. With staircases on both ends and an elevator available, they didn’t cross paths with Marcus, who was descending the opposite way.

Evelyn remained composed. She knew Vivian was still hiding in that room, quietly breaking down. And she wasn’t about to let her suffer alone.

They both froze in their tracks, locking eyes for a brief, tense moment.

"Is that…?" Evelyn wasn’t entirely certain. She had only caught a fleeting glimpse of the man’s sharp side profile.

"That’s Liam, Marcus’s uncle." Nathan’s tone carried an odd edge as he took in Liam’s stormy expression before the man disappeared into the room.

And then, Evelyn pieced it together. Damn. He was eavesdropping from the next room this whole time? Marcus, you really need to be more careful.

Nathan was speechless.

The Blackwoods exchanged confused glances. Who was eavesdropping?

Evelyn’s curiosity flared. Is he going to confront Adriana? I need to see this…

Nathan pulled Evelyn toward the room where Vivian was.

He had intended to knock, but the door wasn’t fully closed. Sensing something was off with Liam and not wanting to alert him, Nathan pushed the door open and strode inside with Evelyn in tow.

At that moment, Vivian was still on the balcony. Her expression was one of stunned disbelief, as if she had just heard something earth-shattering. She was so shocked that she didn’t even react when the two of them suddenly appeared in the room.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s mind was racing.

Oh my God. These two are involved! Liam thinks Adriana’s child is his. He just found out the baby was gone and overheard them discussing having another one to replace it—now he’s barged in demanding answers! What kind of mess is this?!

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen, her breath catching as the shocking revelation unfolded before her. She never anticipated this tangled web of relationships would reveal such a scandalous connection.

Across the room, the Blackwood family struggled to maintain their composure, their expressions a mix of disbelief and horror.

What?

The youngest son of the Prescott family’s patriarch?

Involved with his own brother’s new wife?

At first, everyone had assumed Vivian was merely delusional, desperate to cling to Marcus.

But now, the truth was undeniable—there had been something far more illicit between in-laws.

Just then, the reception was drawing to a close, and Grayson Brooks returned to the main hall. His face was dark with irritation, muttering under his breath.

No doubt, he was furious at his son and brother for abandoning their duties, leaving him—a man in poor health—to entertain guests alone.

Strangely, Grayson didn’t notice the pitying glances the Blackwoods kept throwing his way.

After all, it was tragic—his new wife had betrayed him so brazenly.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was piecing together the fragments of gossip swirling around her. The most frustrating part? She hadn’t even met Adriana yet, leaving crucial gaps in the story.

But Nathan Blackwood was already a step ahead. With a knowing glance, he guided her toward the balcony.

Vivian Grant seemed to have regained her senses, her lashes still damp with tears. As she opened her mouth to speak, Nathan silenced her with a subtle shake of his head.

Fortunately, Vivian was still too naive, too lost in her own emotions to question their sudden appearance. If anything, she looked eager to eavesdrop.

Her mind was consumed by one thought—Marcus considering having a child with someone else.

Next door, Liam Carter was demanding answers about the same matter.

Vivian knew she was the one who had set this disaster in motion. She was prepared to beg for Adriana’s forgiveness, to offer any compensation—but when it came to Marcus?

She refused to let him go.

Yet doubt gnawed at her.

She trusted Marcus’s loyalty. She knew he loved her.

But what if… he also longed for something—or someone—else?
