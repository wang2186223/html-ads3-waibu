###Chapter 1

"Let's get a divorce, Vivian."

The words cut through the sizzle of the frying pan. Isabella Lockhart stood frozen, searing steaks while hot oil splattered against her skin. She barely felt the burns.

Nathaniel Blackwood's voice remained cold and detached. "We're only married on paper. After four years, it's time to end this farce."

Vivian's teeth sank into her lower lip.

'So it's finally happening...'

Four years ago, her world collapsed. The Lockhart fortune vanished overnight. Her parents, crushed by debt, chose death over disgrace. They left their daughter to face the ruins alone.

Her grandfather had once saved Alfred Blackwood's life during the war. With his dying breath, he secured his old friend's promise to protect Vivian. Marriage to Nathaniel became her sanctuary.

Over time, Vivian fell for her husband. She believed devotion could melt his icy heart. That her loyalty would eventually be returned.

She was wrong.

"I'm offering forty million dollars and a penthouse in Harborview City. Sign the papers if you accept." Nathaniel slid the documents across the counter. His expression showed this was merely another business deal.

Vivian scanned the numbers. 'Four years of my life, valued at forty million. The Blackwoods never disappoint.'

"Must we do this?" She met his gaze, the documents trembling in her hand.

The man she'd loved for four years possessed devastating beauty. Yet his perfect features remained as distant as the moon. Untouchable. Unreachable.

"Yes." No hesitation colored his reply.

Pain lanced through Vivian's heart, but she refused to beg. After repeatedly slamming against his walls, she recognized defeat.

'Fine. Forty million for four years of marriage. More than fair.'

"Alright." She snatched the pen and signed with decisive strokes.

Nathaniel blinked, surprised by her swift compliance. The Vivian he knew was fragile. Indecisive. A frightened rabbit constantly seeking protection.

Her sudden strength left a bitter taste in his mouth.

"I'll notify you once the documents are filed. I want you gone by tonight." He dismissed the uncomfortable feeling and turned away.

His message was clear. No discussion would be entertained.

That evening, the housekeeper hurled Vivian's belongings from the villa. The woman had never shown respect, but now her contempt became vicious.

"Gold-digging trash! Finally getting what you deserve!"

Vivian knelt on the cold pavement, gathering her scattered clothes. The night wind whipped around her, deepening her humiliation.

Tires crunched on gravel behind her. A sleek car pulled up, and a tall, slender woman emerged.

"Miss Delacroix! What an honor!" The abusive housekeeper transformed into a fawning servant.

Cassandra Delacroix ignored the woman. "Handle my luggage carefully. You could never repay anything you break."

Vivian's body turned to stone. In that moment, everything became clear.

###Chapter 2

"So that's why Ethan wanted me gone by tonight. He's already got another woman lined up to move in!"

How pathetic that I ever let that man have power over my emotions! I wish I could slap some sense into my past self.

Cassandra sauntered toward Vivian with a smug grin.

"So you're Vivian Lockhart, huh? Why are you still here? Didn't Nathaniel throw you out? Get moving already! Have you no dignity?"

Despite the taunts, Vivian continued packing her things at a deliberate pace.

"Hey, are you ignoring me? I'm talking to you!"

"Sorry, I didn't quite catch that." Vivian met her gaze coolly.

"All I heard was some rabid mutt yapping."

"How dare you call me a mutt?"

"I didn't. Seems you're the one jumping to conclusions." Vivian stood with her suitcase, tilting her head at Cassandra blocking her path.

"Now if you'll excuse me. Good little dogs know better than to stand in people's way."

"You insolent—" Cassandra's face flushed crimson as she stomped her foot.

'Wasn't she supposed to be a doormat? Since when did she grow a backbone?'

The housekeeper rushed to placate Cassandra.

"Please don't upset yourself, Miss Delacroix! Someone like her isn't worth your attention!"

"You'll be mistress of this house soon—that wretched woman is nothing compared to you!"

"Master Blackwood prepared your suite personally. Let me show you!"

The flattery worked. Cassandra lost interest in Vivian and followed the housekeeper inside.

Alone again, Vivian stared at the imposing estate. How ironic—after four years here, she'd be back on the streets.

"Goodbye, Nathaniel." She took a steadying breath and walked away.

Her new one-bedroom apartment downtown felt like freedom.

Shedding the title of "Mrs. Blackwood" lifted an invisible weight. No more gilded cage. No more clipped wings.

Vivian unblocked a number she hadn't dialed in four years.

"Boss! You finally remembered me!" The voice on the line crackled with excitement. "Four damn years!"

This was Julian Montgomery—one of Harborview City's infamous Four Princes. Despite his reckless reputation, he turned downright deferential with Vivian.

"Congrats on the divorce, by the way. Should've dumped that bastard years ago!"

"While you played the meek housewife, your old reputation's been getting dragged through the mud. If those stuffy old men knew their 'mysterious benefactor' was you all along—priceless!"

"So? When's the big comeback? I can—"

"Enough." Vivian nearly hung up.

"I promised Grandfather I'm done with that life. If you respect me at all, keep quiet."

Her past was... complicated. Not something she cared to revisit.

"I need you to look into something."

After briefing Julian, she hung up—just as a text from Nathaniel came through.

Her pulse spiked as she tapped the screen.

[Harborview Courthouse, 9 AM tomorrow.]

Brusque. Clinical. As if she deserved no more consideration than a business memo. The fleeting hope in her chest withered. How foolish to expect anything else.

[Ok.]

She replied in kind.
###Chapter 3

The clock struck 8:30 AM when Vivian arrived at the courthouse, a full half-hour earlier than their agreed meeting time.

She hadn’t just come early—she’d come prepared. A deep crimson halter dress hugged her frame, her hair pulled into a sleek ponytail that exposed the delicate curve of her neck. The morning light caught the smooth expanse of her skin, making her glow like something ethereal.

From a distance, she looked untouchable. Cold. Perfect.

Too bad her body wasn’t cooperating. A fever burned beneath her flawless exterior, leaving her limbs heavy and her head throbbing.

At exactly nine, a silver Bugatti rolled into the lot. The door swung open, and Nathaniel Blackwood stepped out, his expression as icy as ever.

For a fraction of a second, his gaze flickered when he saw her. Then, just as quickly, his lips curled into something mocking.

“Couldn’t wait, could you?” he drawled, striding past her without so much as a pause.

Vivian clenched her jaw. Excuse me? She glared at his retreating back. You’re the one practically sprinting to the counter.

The process itself was laughably simple. A few signatures, a stamp, and in under ten minutes, it was done.

“There’s a mandatory one-month cooling-off period,” the clerk explained, sliding the forms toward them. “If either of you changes your mind, you can file for revocation within thirty days.”

He’d seen his fair share of messy divorces—screaming matches, tearful breakdowns. But this? This was the calmest he’d ever witnessed.

It almost made him wonder why they were splitting up. They looked like they belonged together.

Vivian snatched the papers, scanning the fine print. “A grace period for divorce but not marriage?” she muttered under her breath. “If only—”

Nathaniel’s voice cut through, sharp as a blade. “Regretting it already?”

She met his gaze, unflinching. “Not a chance.” A smirk played on her lips. “Forty million, Nathaniel. Most women would kill for that kind of payout. I’d say I hit the jackpot.”

His jaw tightened, fingers tugging at his tie in irritation.

The Vivian he’d married had been docile. Agreeable. But the closer they got to this moment, the more her words turned to knives.

Just as they turned to leave, a soft voice called out. “Nathaniel? Are you finished?”

Vivian spun around.

Cassandra Delacroix stood there, draped in white, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Fragile. Delicate. Nothing like the sharp-tongued woman from their first encounter.

And then Vivian saw it—the faint swell beneath Cassandra’s dress.

“I told you to wait in the car,” Nathaniel said, his voice colder than she’d ever heard it.

“It’s chilly out here. The baby—”

“Isn’t worth risking.”

Vivian’s chest tightened.

She turned back to Nathaniel, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. “Care to explain, Mr. Blackwood?”

His expression didn’t waver.

“I don’t owe you anything.”
###Chapter 4

"Unbelievable! The audacity of this man!" Vivian's thoughts burned with fury. She had always believed Nathaniel to be a man of integrity—someone who would never stoop to infidelity.

Yet here he was, shattering that illusion completely. Not only was he planning to marry his mistress, but they were also expecting a child together.

That final revelation erased any lingering sorrow in Vivian's heart. She felt nothing but cold resolve now.

"So you were cheating on me, is that it?"

Before Nathaniel could answer, Cassandra wedged herself between them, tears already welling in her eyes. "Miss Lockhart, this is all my fault! If it makes you feel better, you can take your anger out on me—"

Is this woman serious? She’s acting like we’re in some cheap melodrama.

"Really?" Vivian raised her hand as if to strike.

Cassandra shrieked and ducked behind Nathaniel.

"You just said I could punish you however I wanted," Vivian said with a mocking smile, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "Relax, I’m not some barbarian. I don’t resort to slapping people like in those ridiculous dramas."

"If you two are truly in love, I’ll gladly step aside and end this marriage."

"W-what?"

Cassandra blinked in shock. She had been ready to play the victim, but Vivian had just handed her victory without a fight.

So the rumors were true. Their marriage really was just a business arrangement. Why else would she be so calm about her husband’s affair?

Vivian continued, her voice steady. "Since you betrayed me, I think it’s only fair we renegotiate the terms of our divorce."

At the mention of money, Cassandra’s mask slipped.

"Nathaniel already agreed to give you forty million dollars and a penthouse! That’s more than generous! Don’t forget—the Blackwoods were the ones who cleaned up your family’s mess. How can you be so shameless?"

Vivian nearly laughed at Cassandra’s sudden outburst.

"Oh? We’re not even divorced yet, and the mistress is already managing his finances? Worried he’ll lose too much in the settlement? Who’s the greedy one here?"

Cassandra paled. "Th-that’s not what I meant—"

Nathaniel had remained silent until now. His piercing gaze locked onto Vivian. "Go on."

She met his stare without flinching. "I don’t want your money or the penthouse. Just hand over Blackwood Legal."

"Hunts & Co.?" His brow furrowed slightly.

As one of the Elite Eight families of Newport City, the Blackwoods had countless businesses under their empire. A single law firm was insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

He barely remembered its existence—it mostly handled the family’s legal affairs. To him, it was little more than a charity, with employees collecting high salaries for minimal work.

She’s turning down forty million for this worthless firm? What’s her game?

For the first time, Nathaniel studied her closely. In just a few days, she had transformed into someone entirely different.

"That’s my only condition," Vivian said. "I’ll send over the amended paperwork soon. It’s late, so if you’ll excuse me."

She flashed a triumphant smile. "Oh, and I wish you both a very happy life together."

Her cool facade lasted only a moment.

Her vision blurred.

Then everything went black.
###Chapter 5
Vivian felt her knees buckle beneath her.

A strong arm suddenly encircled her waist, steadying her fall. The crisp scent of sandalwood enveloped her, momentarily disorienting her senses.

"You're burning up. Are you ill?" Ethan's voice held an unfamiliar note of worry.

An instinctive need to shield her surged through him.

'She weighs nothing at all,' he thought with unexpected concern.

"This isn't your business!" Vivian snapped as she regained her footing, attempting to wrench free from his grasp.

She'd planned to walk away with dignity after signing the papers, refusing to appear weak before him. But her traitorous body betrayed her, swaying dangerously even after breaking contact.

Without hesitation, Ethan swept her into his arms. "Hospital. Now."

"Put me down!" Vivian thrashed against his chest. "Have you forgotten we're getting divorced?"

"Legally, you're still my wife until the paperwork clears," he countered firmly.

Cassandra's face paled as she watched them leave. This wasn't part of her plan.

"Ethan, wait!" She clutched her stomach dramatically. "I can't keep up in my condition—"

"Elijah will collect you," Ethan threw over his shoulder without breaking stride. "I can't ignore medical emergencies."

Vivian nearly choked on her disbelief.

'First he impregnates his mistress and files for divorce. Now he's playing the concerned husband?'

'What game is this? Does he think I'm that gullible?'

'Fine. If he wants to play, I'll play.'

With sudden sweetness, she looped her arms around his neck. "How gallant of you, darling ex-husband," she purred, fluttering her lashes.

Ethan's expression darkened, his thoughts unreadable. Across the room, Cassandra's nails dug into her palms.

——

The hospital visit stretched longer than expected. Ethan remained throughout the examination, even waiting for lab results.

"39.3°C," the doctor adjusted his glasses sternly. "Viral, not bacterial. Any later and we'd be discussing organ failure, not fever management."

He turned his disapproval on Ethan. "What sort of husband lets his wife wander underdressed with such a high fever?"

Before Ethan could respond, Vivian burst into theatrical sobs. "Don't blame him, doctor! Sure, he starves me, locks me out in winter storms, cheats openly, and is divorcing me against my will—but I'd endure anything for that handsome face!"

Ethan blinked. 'Since when did she become this... dramatic?'

The doctor sighed deeply. "Youth these days..."

"Complete the IV drip before leaving," he instructed before exiting.

Alone in the ward, tension thickened between them. Four years of marriage, yet they'd rarely shared space like this.

Ethan loomed over the bed. "Finished your performance?"

Vivian coughed weakly. "For now."

The gravity of her condition finally registered—she'd genuinely risked her life.

"Why not reschedule when you felt ill?"

Propped against pillows, fever-flushed and vulnerable, she resembled the gentle woman he once knew. The sight inexplicably tightened his chest.

"Why postpone the inevitable, Mr. Blackwood?" Her whisper held heartbreaking resignation.

She wanted his affection, but refused to indulge the fantasy.

"Thank you for today. You should go—your expecting girlfriend must be worried."

The reminder visibly hardened his features. "Right."

As he turned to leave, a tall figure darkened the doorway.

"Ms. Lockhart, I never imagined divorce proceedings would land you in hospital..."
###Chapter 6

Nathaniel Blackwood's icy presence froze the air the moment Liam stepped into the hospital room.

Liam's cocky grin faltered as his eyes locked onto the imposing figure standing beside Vivian's bed. The tension between them crackled like static.

"Do you two know each other?" Nathaniel's voice was sharp enough to cut glass.

His mind raced. How could a notorious playboy like Liam Osborne and Vivian Lockhart, the poised heiress, possibly cross paths? Their worlds were galaxies apart.

Vivian buried her face in her hands. She had texted Liam to meet her here, but she hadn’t expected him to arrive so quickly.

This is like some terrible rom-com cliché—ex-husband meets the charming bad boy.

"Know her? She’s my muse!" Liam declared, striding forward with a bouquet of sunflowers.

He smirked at Nathaniel. "Little do you know, Mr. Blackwood, Miss Lockhart was legendary at Stanford. She had admirers lining up for miles. And me? I’m her most devoted fan."

Liam turned back to Vivian, his expression softening. "As your biggest supporter, I had to come celebrate you finally filing those divorce papers. Today’s a victory!"

He handed her the flowers, his gaze unusually sincere. "Sunflowers—your favorite. They stand for loyalty and new beginnings. Perfect for you."

Vivian’s chest tightened. She did love sunflowers. But to her, they had always symbolized unwavering love—the kind she’d foolishly given Nathaniel.

Now, it was time to move on.

She inhaled the fresh scent and smiled. "First flowers I’ve gotten in four years. Thank you."

"I’ll send you a fresh bouquet every day if you let me," Liam promised.

Nathaniel’s glare could’ve frozen hell over. The room temperature plummeted.

Liam noticed and smirked. "Mr. Blackwood, I owe you my gratitude. You’ve set a goddess free. Newport City just got its queen back."

Nathaniel ignored him entirely. To him, Liam was just Theodore Osborne’s spoiled brat—unworthy of acknowledgment.

But the sight of golden sunflowers against Vivian’s beauty struck him. He muttered under his breath, "I didn’t know you liked sunflowers."

"There’s a lot you don’t know about me," she replied coolly. "Liam, put these in water for me?"

"On it!" Liam obeyed instantly.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. What is their relationship?

Liam Osborne—infamous flirt, acting like a lovesick puppy around Vivian?

"Was there something else, Mr. Blackwood?" Vivian’s polite smile was a clear dismissal.

Nathaniel’s voice dropped dangerously low. "Remember, you’re still legally my wife. Conduct yourself accordingly."

"I will. At least I won’t end up with a surprise child like you did."

Nathaniel stormed out before he lost his temper.

The second the door shut, Liam burst out laughing.

"Did you see his face? Priceless!" He wiped tears from his eyes. "Four years, and I’ve never seen him crack. You destroyed him!"

Vivian didn’t laugh.

Nathaniel might be cold, but he was still the man she’d loved for years. This wasn’t how she’d imagined their story ending.

"Enough," she said quietly. "Where’s what I asked for? Hand it over."
###Chapter 7

"I've got everything right here. Would I dare slack off when you're my boss?" Liam dropped his playful act and handed Vivian a thick stack of documents.

Despite her weakened state, Vivian quickly flipped through the pages.

A satisfied smirk curled her lips moments later. "Perfect. I knew those lawyers weren't as straightforward as they seemed. They're worth far more than the settlement he offered!"

"Tsk, but they're Ethan Blackwood's people. How good could they really be?" Liam scoffed, leaning against her hospital bed railing with crossed legs. "I know plenty of better lawyers. Want some recommendations?"

"No. I want them," Vivian stated firmly, her mood unshaken by the divorce.

"Boss, are you scheming something? I can practically smell trouble brewing," Liam said, barely containing his excitement.

Four years. It's been four damn years. The queen is back—the ruthless, brilliant queen who never backs down from a challenge.

"Come on, spill it!" he pressed.

Vivian only gave him a sly, secretive smile. "Patience. You'll find out soon enough."

Knowing her too well, Liam didn't push further. She wouldn't budge, and if he annoyed her enough, she'd block him again—something he couldn't afford.

"But..." He straightened, testing her patience carefully. "Are you sure you're over that... ice statue?"

He knew better than anyone how deeply Vivian had loved Ethan. Letting go wouldn't be easy.

"What if I'm not?" Vivian sighed, her voice quiet. "Being his wife was exhausting. It was a losing battle. Now, I just want to be Vivian Lockhart again."

At the Blackwood estate, Nathaniel's parents, Alfred and Eleanor Whitmore, had polar opposite reactions to Cassandra's pregnancy.

Eleanor was ecstatic, clinging to Cassandra as if she were a miracle. "Oh my god, you're carrying my son's child!"

"You have no idea how devastated I was after Sebastian died. I thought my life was over... But this baby—it's a blessing! Maybe it's Sebastian's soul returning to us!"

"You must take care of yourself. This child is our family's future!"

Meanwhile, Alfred's expression darkened. He glared at Nathaniel. "What the hell have you done, boy? You got another woman pregnant while still married to Vivian?"

"Have you forgotten what her grandfather did for us? If Arthur Lockhart hadn't saved our family, we'd be ruined! We promised to take care of her!"

Furious, Alfred lunged at Nathaniel. "I should kill you for this!"

Cassandra threw herself between them, tears welling up. "Please, Mr. Blackwood, don't blame him! It's my fault. If this is causing so much trouble, I'll get rid of it tomorrow!"

"Absolutely not!" Eleanor snapped, shielding Cassandra. "This child is a Blackwood! It will be born!"

She turned on Alfred. "Why are you so obsessed with the Lockharts? If Vivian had truly mattered to Nathaniel, no other woman could've come between them!"

"She's just a has-been heiress with no real skills. What has she ever done for our family? We've supported her for four years—isn't that enough to repay Arthur?"

"It's 2023! Nathaniel can marry whoever he wants! Stay out of his life!"

After her tirade, Eleanor turned to Nathaniel, who had remained silent.

"Well? What's your decision?"
###Chapter 8

Ethan stood with his shoulders squared, his expression unreadable as he processed his father's ultimatum.

His gaze dropped to Cassandra's barely visible baby bump. "As you can see," he said coolly, "Cassandra is already three months along. This child carries the Blackwood bloodline. She needs a proper title before the birth. I've finalized the divorce with Vivian. Once the paperwork clears, Cassandra and I will be legally married."

Margaret and Cassandra exhaled in unison, tension visibly draining from their shoulders.

But Leonard's fury only intensified. His hands clenched into fists, knuckles white. "You absolute fool!" he roared. "You're throwing away your wife for some cheap fling? Have you lost your damn mind?"

"If Arthur Lockhart were alive to see this, he'd rise from his grave to throttle you himself! That man was a decorated war hero—do you think he'd stand for this disgrace?"

"End this farce now!"

Eleanor scoffed, rolling her eyes dramatically. "Please. If the Lockharts were so impressive, their empire wouldn't have crumbled. We took in their last heir out of pity! Do you have any idea how many enemies we made because of that girl?"

"We've repaid any debt ten times over. And let's not forget—Arthur himself said the marriage only needed to last four years. If there was no love by then, they could walk away. Ethan isn't the villain here!"

The argument grated on Ethan's nerves. His voice cut through the room like ice. "I've said my piece. If you want to keep shouting, take it elsewhere."

Leonard dragged a hand down his face. "You've always been stubborn. Sebastian was the only one who could ever talk sense into you... If he were still here—"

The mention of his late brother cast a heavy silence over the room.

Three months ago, Sebastian's death had shattered the Blackwoods. Ethan, already distant, withdrew completely.

"Fine," Leonard bit out. "Marry her if you must. But on one condition—or I'll disown you myself."

Ethan didn't flinch. "Name it."

"Your grandfather can't know. Not before his heart surgery. You know how much he adores Vivian. If he finds out you replaced her with a mistress, it’ll kill him."

Ethan gave a curt nod. "Understood."

The older couple finally left, though not before Eleanor fussed over Cassandra like a prized broodmare. Leonard pointedly ignored her, leaving Cassandra sweating through her forced smile.

None of that mattered. The only opinion that counted was Ethan's.

Upstairs, Ethan stared blankly at the sunflower field below. He rarely visited the estate—had never noticed the golden sea swaying beyond the terrace.

Sunflowers.

He'd learned today they were Vivian's favorite.

Loyalty. New beginnings.

Was that what she wanted? A fresh start? Had being his wife been so unbearable?

"Ethan?" Cassandra's tearful voice interrupted his thoughts. She dabbed at her eyes. "I'm sorry we're causing so much trouble. Maybe... we should just let this go?"

He turned slowly. Grief darkened his usually sharp gaze.

"No," he said hoarsely. "We can't. This was Sebastian's last wish."
###Chapter 9

If time could be rewound, Nathaniel Blackwood would gamble everything to return to that night three months ago.

That fateful evening on the streets of Newport City, the two brothers had been ambushed while discussing the future of their family. Sebastian had thrown himself in front of Nathaniel without hesitation, taking the bullet meant for his brother.

With his last breath, Sebastian had whispered about the woman he loved—Cassandra Delacroix. And the child she carried.

"Marry her. Give them the family I can't. Promise me."

Nathaniel would never forget the way his brother’s bloodied hands had clutched at him, desperation staining every word.

If he could go back, he would have shoved Sebastian aside. He should have been the one to die.

Cassandra’s voice pulled him from the memory, her tone dripping with false sorrow. "You’ve angered your father for my sake. And poor Isabella… I feel terrible about this!"

She dabbed at nonexistent tears. "I’ll raise this child alone if I must. I’m strong enough—for Sebastian’s sake."

‘Pathetic act,’ Nathaniel thought coldly. ‘But men fall for it every time.’

Yet he only stepped back, his expression unreadable. "My father doesn’t know the truth. His reaction means nothing."

"As for Isabella Lockhart…" He paused, jaw tightening. "Our marriage was a farce. Four years, and I never touched her. The divorce would have happened regardless."

Cassandra’s eyes gleamed. "But she must love you. How could she not? A man like you…"

She had meant to play with Sebastian—a dull, devoted fool. But Nathaniel? He was different. The moment she saw him, she wanted him. And Isabella was in her way.

"She doesn’t love me."

‘Otherwise, she wouldn’t have looked so relieved signing those papers.’

Cassandra nearly smiled. ‘Good. The rumors were true.’

"What a shame," she sighed, inching closer. "But her loss is my gain."

Nathaniel’s fingers clenched around his tie. "It’s late. I’m leaving."

"This is your house!" she protested.

"I don’t live here."

Her face fell. ‘He’s leaving already?’

‘No wonder they never slept together. Four years of nothing? Pathetic.’

Three days after being discharged, Isabella was moving out of her apartment.

Liam had insisted on relocating her. "Boss, this place is beneath you."

She rolled her eyes at the address he sent—a penthouse in West Langsmith. ‘Since when is a million-dollar condo "lowkey"?’

Her phone rang before she could call him back.

"Miss Lockhart? This is General Hospital. Your test results require immediate attention."
###Chapter 10

Vivian's hands trembled as she clutched the medical report.

The words blurred before her eyes.

"Miss Lockhart, your HCG levels are elevated," the nurse said with a professional smile. "You're approximately four weeks pregnant."

Vivian's breath hitched.

"Excuse me?"

"Congratulations," the nurse beamed before walking away.

Alone in the sterile hallway, Vivian's mind reeled.

This can't be real.

One night. One reckless, emotional night—and now this.

Her stomach twisted.

Ethan Blackwood's child.

The memory surfaced like a ghost.

A month ago, after Sebastian's funeral, Ethan had been shattered. The cold, untouchable CEO had crumbled before her eyes, drowning in grief and whiskey.

She had stayed.

She had comforted him.

And then—

Her nails dug into her palms.

Stupid. So stupid.

The divorce was already messy enough. Now this?

She exhaled sharply.

Should I tell him?

The thought made her chest tighten.

Before she could decide, a familiar voice cut through her thoughts.

"Vivian? What are you doing here?"

She turned.

Cassandra Delacroix stood there, one hand resting on her rounded belly. Beside her, Ethan looked as immaculate as ever—sharp suit, colder eyes.

The perfect picture of a happy couple.

Vivian's throat burned.

"Just a check-up," she said lightly, forcing a smile. "Don't let me interrupt."

She moved to leave.

Ethan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

"You're pale," he said, voice low. "What's wrong?"

Vivian met his gaze—those piercing eyes she once loved.

"Nothing that concerns you, future ex-husband."

His jaw tightened.

"Not ex yet," he countered, gaze dropping to the crumpled report in her hand. "What were you checking up on?"

His fingers brushed the paper.

Vivian yanked it away.

"Goodbye, Ethan."

She walked away before he could see her hands shake.

Before he could see the truth written in black and white.
###Chapter 11

Nathaniel's expression was darker than storm clouds. Vivian's fingers curled tighter around her medical report as bitterness churned in her chest.

Cassandra caught the tension instantly. She wedged herself between them with practiced ease, thrusting her own ultrasound images toward Vivian's face.

"Mrs. Blackwood, look! My little angel's already twelve weeks along." Cassandra's voice dripped honey. "See those perfect fingers? That button nose? All thanks to you stepping aside so gracefully."

Vivian's nails bit into her palms. The grainy image showed a fully developed fetus - a stark contrast to the tiny embryo in her own report.

'How poetic,' she thought. 'Her thriving baby versus my barely-there clump of cells.'

Cassandra wasn't finished. "You're practically this child's guardian angel. Why don't you pick a name? That way, we'll always remember your... generosity."

Vivian's laugh came out razor-sharp. "You want me to name Nathaniel's bastard? How delightfully twisted."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Vivian, you don't have to—"

"Oh but I insist." Vivian tapped her chin mockingly. "How about... Nemesis Blackwood?"

Cassandra's smile faltered. "N-Nicholas?"

"N-E-M-E-S-I-S." Vivian enunciated each letter. "The goddess of retribution. Fitting, don't you think? For the consequences of betrayal?"

Cassandra's manicured fingers trembled. Nathaniel's stormy gaze locked onto Vivian. "That's enough."

"Or what?" Vivian met his glare without flinching. "Will the great Nathaniel Blackwood punish me for speaking truth?" Her lips curled. "Tell me, husband - who crossed the line first? The cheater or the cheated?"
###Chapter 12

Nathaniel's hands balled into tight fists at his sides. His knuckles turned white from the pressure.

This woman had always seemed like a docile doll to him before - quiet, obedient, without a thought of her own. He never imagined she could bare such sharp claws when provoked. She clearly didn't need his protection.

Cassandra seized the moment to play victim again, clinging to Nathaniel's arm like ivy. "Please don't be angry with Miss Lockhart," she pleaded with practiced tears. "This is all mine and the baby's fault! She had to give you up despite loving you so much... Of course she'd resent us! Let her vent her anger on me if she must—"

"Wrong again." Vivian's laugh was razor-sharp. "Don't thank me. I wasn't being generous - I threw out the trash I didn't want anymore, and you happened to pick it up. That's why this baby is your karma. I told you the name fits, didn't I?"

She turned to Nathaniel with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Though indecent people tend to get bad karma, Mr. Blackwood. I suspect you'll have quite the streak of misfortune coming your way."

Nathaniel's expression darkened further. Every word from her lips made his blood boil hotter.

"My mother always warned me to steer clear of unlucky people," Vivian continued breezily. "Wouldn't want that rubbing off on me. So by all means, marry each other. I'll respect your choice. Ta-ta now!"

No one in Newport City would dare provoke Nathaniel Blackwood this way. She was playing with fire.

Before he could react, Vivian spun on her heel and strode away, leaving her cutting words hanging in the air. She didn't care about their reactions - the satisfaction of speaking her mind was enough.

'If they're offended... good. They deserve it.'

As Vivian disappeared, Cassandra studied Nathaniel's face carefully. A man of his temper wouldn't tolerate such insults. Yet to her shock, the corner of his mouth twitched upward - was he... smiling?

"Don't be angry," Cassandra pressed on, hoping to bait him. "Miss Lockhart just spoke out of anger. Blame me and the baby, don't hold it against her—"

Her whining grated on his nerves. Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on the doorway where Vivian had vanished.

'Heh... my soon-to-be ex-wife... is rather intriguing.'

Vivian's chest ached with mingled fury and sorrow as she left the hospital. That despicable couple enraged her, but the thought of her lost child cut deeper.

Whenever she remembered the tiny life that had been growing inside her, frustration welled up. 'That child could have had everything - a brilliant future. But it died because of its worthless, immoral father.'

Taking a deep breath, she pulled out her laptop. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, weaving complex code in under ten minutes. A sophisticated virus took shape.

With a satisfied smirk, Vivian activated the program.

Thirty minutes later, Blackwood Group's entire corporate system was compromised, leaking sensitive client data.

Nathaniel was still at the hospital when the frantic call came in.

"A virus? Who's responsible?!"

Meanwhile, Vivian sipped coffee by a tranquil pond, watching sunlight dance on the water's surface. The peaceful scene soothed her frayed nerves.

She'd warned Nathaniel about impending misfortune. That virus would keep Blackwood Group in crisis mode for at least two weeks.

She hadn't lied.
###Chapter 13

Tension crackled through the Blackwood Group headquarters like static before a storm.

Ethan Young's furious voice echoed across fifty floors. "Two days! Two damn days and none of you can stop this breach? What the hell do I pay you for?" His fist slammed against the conference table. "Our clients' data is leaking like a sieve. Fix this now or clean out your desks!"

As Nathaniel Blackwood's right-hand man, Ethan carried the weight of the crisis on his shoulders.

The cyberattack had hit without warning. For forty-eight sleepless hours, every tech specialist in Newport City had been battling the relentless digital assault.

Antony Gray, head of cybersecurity, wiped sweat from his brow. "This isn't about competence. The hacker's using military-grade encryption. Their IP bounces across servers in different countries every ninety seconds." His voice turned defensive. "My team includes three national coding champions. If we can't crack this, nobody can."

Then a quiet voice spoke from the back of the room.

"There is a solution."

All heads turned toward the bespectacled junior analyst.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. "Spit it out."

The young man adjusted his glasses. "We wait. Three more days and the virus self-destructs."

"You're joking." Ethan's face darkened like thunderclouds.

"Explain." Nathaniel's icy command cut through the tension. The Blackwood CEO lounged in his chair, idly spinning a Montblanc pen between his fingers. His calm demeanor somehow made the room feel ten degrees colder.

The analyst swallowed hard. "The code structure matches the signature of Scarlet Phoenix. Legendary hacker. Untraceable. Their malware always has a five-day expiration."

Murmurs rippled through the room.

"Scarlet Phoenix vanished years ago. Why resurface now to target us?"

"Some say they're a teenage genius. Others claim it's a sixty-year-old Russian."

"Once their code activates, resistance makes it worse. Like fighting quicksand."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. He remembered Isabella's warning at the hospital. Five hundred million dollars already lost. The woman was either psychic or...

"Scarlet Phoenix." Nathaniel tested the name on his tongue. It tasted like defeat - a flavor he refused to swallow.

His pen snapped in half.

"Ethan." Nathaniel's voice could have frozen hell. "Put a two-hundred-million-dollar bounty on Phoenix's identity. I want this ghost dragged into the light."
###Chapter 14

"Achoo! Achoo!"

Vivian Lockhart sneezed violently as she stepped into the packed restaurant, her ears burning with each convulsion.

"Strange. I know I'm not sick anymore," she muttered, rubbing her nose. "Then why won't these sneezes stop?"

Sophia Osborne slid into the booth across from her, tossing a copy of 'Newport Daily' onto the table. "Someone's definitely gossiping about you, Viv. And guess what? Your soon-to-be ex-husband just put a two-hundred-million bounty on your head!"

As Nathaniel Blackwood's twin sister, Sophia shared a unique bond with Vivian. Unlike her brother's hero worship, their relationship thrived on equal footing - trading barbs and creating chaos wherever they went.

Vivian skimmed the headline and smirked. "If he's got time for petty revenge games, maybe he should fix that pathetic security system first. Took me less than ten minutes to breach it. Pathetic."

"That's my girl!" Sophia grinned, raising her beer. "Never change, Phoenix. Though honestly, how did that ice sculpture Nathaniel end up with someone like Cassandra? The man's got the emotional range of a teaspoon."

She took a swig before continuing, "And after everything you've done for Blackwood Group! Without you intercepting those cyberattacks, their system would've collapsed years ago. Ungrateful bastard deserves what's coming."

Sophia had once rooted for their marriage, hoping the arranged union would blossom into love. That fantasy shattered when Nathaniel moved his pregnant mistress into their home. The betrayal still burned hotter in Sophia's chest than Vivian's ever could.

A waiter arrived with sizzling skewers and chilled beers. Sophia immediately cracked one open, downing half in one go while Vivian hesitated over the menu.

"Come on, Viv! Freedom's just around the corner!" Sophia waved another beer enticingly. "Let's get properly wasted tonight!"

Vivian bit her lip and signaled the waiter. "Orange juice, please. And the grilled chicken salad."

Sophia choked on her drink. "Are you kidding me? This is your divorce celebration! Since when do you turn down spicy food and alcohol?"

"I... can't today. You know how it is." Vivian avoided direct eye contact, fingers tracing the condensation on her water glass.

She hadn't told anyone about the pregnancy, not even Sophia. The private clinic appointment was already booked for two days from now. Yet despite her decision, some irrational part kept worrying about the baby's wellbeing.

"Oh! Right." Sophia's eyes widened in understanding. She pushed a glass of warm water toward Vivian. "Should've guessed. Here, this'll help."

"Thanks, Soph." Vivian smiled softly.

Saving the Osborne twins remained her proudest achievement. They'd become her chosen family - the only people she trusted completely.

"Well, well. If it isn't the perfect Mrs. Blackwood?" A mocking voice cut through their conversation as a shadow fell across their table.
###Chapter 15

The arrogant voice belonged to Julian Blackthorn. A cigarette dangled from his lips as he swaggered toward Vivian, flanked by five lackeys.

"Remember how your parents owed me a fortune and then had the audacity to report me for illegal dealings?" He exhaled smoke, his smirk turning vicious. "Cost me millions in fines and two weeks in a cell!"

"When I finally got out, ready to make them pay, I found out those cowards jumped off a damn building!" His laugh was sharp, mocking. "But here you are—their precious daughter. Tell me, how many times will you beg before I decide to forgive you?"

Sophia shot up from her seat, eyes blazing. "Beg? Over my dead body! Get lost before you regret it!"

Julian's face twisted in fury. He jabbed a finger inches from Sophia's face. "Who the hell are you, brat? This is between me and her. Take your own advice and scram!"

"Consider this your only warning." Sophia stepped between Vivian and Julian, her voice icy. "Run while you still can. If you push her too far... you won't walk away from this."

For a second, Julian and his men froze—then burst into laughter.

"Regret? Oh, that's rich." Julian wiped tears from his eyes. "You must not know, little girl. The Blackwoods tossed this pathetic bitch out. Without them, she's nothing. And now? She's mine to deal with."

He'd waited years for this. The moment Vivian lost the Blackwood name, he'd known revenge was finally his.

"Luck's on my side today." His gaze raked over her, hungry. "Time to pay up. No money? Then your body will do just fine."

His fingers reached for her—

Vivian sidestepped, sipping her water calmly. "Sure. But are you really prepared for what comes next?"

Julian grinned. "Try me."

She set the glass down, meeting his eyes with a slow, dangerous smile. "Then follow me. The park's quiet this time of day."

They walked off, leaving his men gaping. Sophia pinched the bridge of her nose, hesitating before calling out, "Hey—"

Julian didn't even glance back. "Relax. I'll be gentle. Gotta keep her pretty face intact for... later."

Sophia sighed, watching him with pity.

Poor bastard. He has no idea who he's messing with. Not after what Nathaniel just put her through.

At this point, I'm just praying his fat ass can take the beating.

Minutes later, a bloodcurdling scream tore through the park.

"NO! PLEASE—MERCY!"
###Chapter 16

The screams echoing through the alley weren't Vivian's. They belonged to Julian Blackthorn.

"What the hell just happened?" His goons exchanged nervous glances.

Five minutes later, Vivian emerged unscathed. She rolled her shoulders, her face an unreadable mask. Not a single hair out of place.

"Done?" Sophia asked.

"Yeah. Been a while since I had to do that." Vivian cracked her knuckles. "Took me two extra seconds. Getting rusty."

Sophia snorted. "Rusty? That bastard screamed like you were skinning him alive! Is he even breathing?"

"Probably." Vivian turned icy eyes toward the trembling men. "Get your boss to a hospital if you want him to keep doing that."

The goons didn't need telling twice. They scrambled away, dragging their whimpering leader between them.

Sophia wasn't surprised. When she and Oliver had been kidnapped years ago, Vivian had taken down ten armed men single-handedly. That was when they'd first seen the lethal skills hidden beneath her polished society demeanor.

Now? They were numb to it.

Their boss was Arthur Lockhart's granddaughter, after all. Anyone expecting a helpless damsel was a fool.

The Hunts had clearly been blind.

"Viv, I spent years worrying marriage would soften you." Sophia clinked their glasses. "Turns out you're still the apex predator."

Vivian's laugh was light. "To freedom."

No more pretending to be Nathaniel Blackwood's perfect wife. No more wondering what kind of woman he preferred.

She was free.

The next morning found Vivian at an exclusive clinic early.

This place guaranteed absolute discretion. No one would ever know about the pregnancy. Or the termination.

It would be like this child never existed.

As the appointment time neared, Vivian's pulse raced. Her knuckles whitened around the chair arms.

'Just one small procedure,' she told herself. 'Then everything goes back to normal.'

"Isabella Lockhart?" A nurse called.

Vivian stood on unsteady legs.

The doctor scanned her chart with clinical detachment. "No contraindications. We can proceed immediately if you're certain."

"I am."

"Change into this, then we'll begin." The doctor hesitated. "Have you reviewed your file? Do you understand how unusual this pregnancy is?"
###Chapter 17

"What do you mean?"

Vivian's brows furrowed in confusion.

"According to your HCG levels, you're expecting twins. And preliminary scans suggest one boy and one girl..."

The doctor's voice held a note of sympathy. "Do you realize how rare fraternal twins are? This pregnancy is already a miracle given your fertility history. Are you absolutely certain about terminating?"

"Fraternal twins?" Vivian's fingers trembled as they clutched the medical report, her chest tightening with conflicting emotions.

"Medically speaking, your body isn't suited for easy conception. If you proceed with this abortion, future pregnancies may be impossible. I strongly advise reconsideration."

The doctor adjusted her gloves and turned toward the door. "Next patient, please."

A nurse approached with a clipboard. "If you've decided, follow me to pre-op."

Minutes later, the surgical light flickered to life. Vivian mechanically changed into a hospital gown, her face an emotionless mask as she approached the operating table—

—

The night air bit sharply as Vivian stumbled into the same dimly lit bar from yesterday.

She'd come to drown her sorrows, yet found herself ordering ginger tea and chicken soup instead.

In the end, she'd fled the clinic. One life was unbearable to extinguish—but two? Impossible.

"My foolish little ones," she whispered to her flat stomach, "of all the parents in this world, why choose us?"

She raised her teacup in a bitter toast. "To your new lives then—lives without a father's love."

The decision was made. She'd bear these twins alone. The physical pain meant nothing compared to the ache of knowing what they'd lack.

As she drained her cup, shadows converged around her booth.

"Boss! That's the bitch who put Brad in the ER!"

Vivian recognized the speaker—one of last night's would-be assailants. Revenge had arrived.

"Her?" Julian Blackthorn scoffed. The notorious crime lord hadn't expected his enforcer's attacker to be this delicate-looking woman.

"Yes, me." Vivian set down her cup with deliberate calm. "Block my light again, and you'll join your pervert friend in intensive care."

"Big words for such a tiny thing." Julian seized her collar. "Let me educate you about how things work in my territory—"

"Educate me?" A dangerous smile curved Vivian's lips. How perfect—a stress-relief punching bag delivered right when she needed it most.

Knuckles cracked.

A sudden blur of motion sent Julian crashing into a table. A towering figure now shielded Vivian like an impenetrable fortress.

"Who touched her?" Ethan Blackwood's voice could freeze hell itself. "Step forward. Now."
###Chapter 18

Vivian stood frozen, her eyes locked on the broad-shouldered figure before her.

Of all the people in Newport City, why did it have to be him? And why now? Was he following me?

The thugs hesitated under Ethan's commanding presence. Their grips tightened around metal bats as they exchanged nervous glances.

"Who the hell are you?" Their leader's voice cracked. "This ain't your business, pretty boy!"

Ethan's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Names don't matter. What matters is you picked the wrong woman to mess with."

Otto staggered to his feet, clutching his bruised ribs. "You'll regret this, rich boy! Nobody crosses Otto Gold and walks away!"

"Enough talk!" He signaled his men. "Crush them!"

Ten attackers surged forward, weapons raised. Pedestrians scattered like leaves in a storm.

Ethan positioned himself between Vivian and danger. With one fluid motion, he loosened his tie. "Close your eyes, darling. This won't take long."

His foot connected with the first attacker's jaw, sending the man sprawling.

Vivian observed from behind her human shield, impressed despite herself. Who knew the ice-cold CEO could fight like this?

The Blackwood heir moved with lethal precision. Each strike found its mark. Within minutes, groaning bodies littered the pavement.

"Remember this lesson." Ethan dusted off his tailored suit. "She's off-limits."

Vivian crossed her arms, an amused spectator to this dramatic rescue. Four years of silence, and now he plays the knight in shining armor? Please.

Otto's hand closed around a broken bottle. Rage twisted his features as he lunged.

"Ethan! Behind you!"

Glass shattered against skull. Crimson rivulets streaked down Ethan's temple.

"Damn it." His fingers came away stained red. The color drained from his face.

Vivian caught him as his knees buckled. "Blackwood? Are you hurt?"

His breathing turned shallow. "Can't... protect you... run..."

She frowned. A head wound shouldn't fell someone who just took down ten men.

Then realization struck. "You're not weak - you're hemophobic!"

Ethan's eyelids fluttered. "The blood... I can't..." His body went limp in her arms.
###Chapter 19

Ethan Blackwood blinked awake to the sterile white ceiling of a hospital room. His head throbbed beneath layers of gauze.

Vivian Lockhart hadn't left his side. The moment his eyes opened, her shoulders relaxed—just slightly—before she schooled her expression into something colder.

"You're conscious. Good. I'm leaving."

She lied. Every nerve in her body had been wired with worry, but she'd be damned before letting him see it.

His fingers closed around her wrist before she could step away. Weak, but insistent.

"Are you hurt?" His voice was rough, but his gaze—sharp as ever—scanned her for injuries.

Vivian's laugh was ice. "Save the concern, Mr. Blackwood. That heroic stunt nearly got you killed. I'm perfectly fine."

Four years. Four years she'd ached for even a shred of his attention. Now? It meant nothing.

Ethan ignored her tone, brow furrowing. "Those weren't just random thugs. How did you get away?"

Vivian stiffened. Explaining she'd knocked three men unconscious with her bare hands wasn't an option.

"That hard to answer?" His stare turned probing.

She met it head-on, pulse steady. "I name-dropped you, obviously. The mighty Blackwood heir."

"The second they heard who you were, they practically groveled. Then I dragged your sorry self here."

Flawless logic. The Blackwood name carried enough weight to make most criminals piss themselves.

Ethan bought it. But as his eyes traced her frame, something dark flickered in his expression.

"If you knew my name would work, why wait?"

Vivian blinked.

"Next time someone harasses you," he continued, voice low, "skip the theatrics. Just say you're my ex-wife."

Her lips parted. The audacity.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said sweetly, "do you know how many species go extinct daily?"

Ethan frowned. "What?"

"Exactly. None of your business."

His jaw clenched.

Vivian leaned in, smile razor-thin. "Know why curiosity killed the cat?"

"Why?"

"Because it couldn't mind its own damn business." She tossed her hair back. "Twenty days. That's all that's left. Focus on not dying—I hear it's bad for your health."

She turned before he could retort.

The Vivian from four years ago would've melted at his concern. This version? She'd rather swallow glass.

"Goodbye." The door clicked shut behind her.

No looking back.

Except—

She collided with a figure in the hallway. Hard.

Margaret Whitmore's perfume hit her first. Floral. Expensive.

And currently laced with venom.
###Chapter 20

"Ouch! Watch where you're going!" Margaret snapped, rubbing her forehead where the impact had left a dull ache.

When she realized it was Vivian who had bumped into her, her irritation flared instantly.

"What are you doing here?"

"I knew my dear Maggie would attract misfortune wherever she goes," Vivian remarked dryly.

A cold smirk curled on Vivian's lips. "Don't worry. Just endure me for twenty more days, and we'll be done."

"What do you mean?" Margaret's eyes narrowed, her voice sharp. "It's not like you'll vanish into thin air after that."

"No, I won't," Vivian said, her smile polite but icy. "But our divorce will be finalized by then."

"Even if your precious son grovels at my feet, I've sworn never to involve myself with the Blackwoods again. It's better for both of us."

Margaret gaped at her, momentarily speechless.

What the hell happened? She used to be so meek, letting me walk all over her. Now she’s like a completely different person.

"How dare you speak to me like that?"

"Why wouldn’t I?" Vivian countered, unfazed.

Before, she had tolerated Margaret’s behavior solely because she was Ethan’s mother—her mother-in-law.

But now? There was no reason left to endure her cruelty.

"I'm just treating you the way you've always treated me. If you want respect, earn it."

"You insolent little—!" Margaret raised her hand, ready to strike.

Before the blow could land, Ethan appeared, gripping her wrist. "Mother, enough."

Only then did Margaret notice the fresh blood staining his bandages. Her face paled.

"Ethan! You have hemophobia! How could you be so reckless? Do you want to give me a heart attack?"

"Your brother is already gone. If something happens to you, how will I go on?"

Ethan winced, dizziness washing over him. He pressed a hand to his temple. "Mother, please... just be quiet."

Vivian clenched her fists, listening.

Hemophobia? Since when? I never knew.

"Are you okay? Should I call a doctor?" Margaret fretted. "Fine, fine, I’ll stop talking. Let’s get you back to bed."

She shot Vivian a venomous glare. "Since you’re divorcing this ungrateful wretch anyway, I won’t waste my breath!"

Ethan collapsed onto the bed, too exhausted to argue.

Margaret tucked him in, still muttering. "You’re just as foolish. Risking yourself for her? Does she even care? Has she thanked you? No!"

"The Lockharts are nothing but parasites. Her parents scammed investors—they deserved what they got!"

"And after everything we’ve done for her, this is how she repays us? Good riddance!"

Vivian’s gratitude toward the Blackwoods evaporated instantly.

Ungrateful?

If I were a parasite, why did Blackwood Group survive the economic crash three years ago?

If I were truly selfish, why was their company spared in the cyberattack?

She had protected them countless times—silently, without expecting praise.

Forget it. They’re not worth my energy.

She turned to Ethan, her voice flat. "I’ve sent the revised divorce papers to your office. Sign them when you’re ready."

Ethan frowned.

Didn’t I say those exact words to her before?

She’s turning the tables on me so easily. No hesitation. No regret.

Then why… does it sting so much?

Before he could respond, Vivian was already gone.
###Chapter 21

Vivian Lockhart stepped into her Sunup Heights apartment and immediately powered up her laptop. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she swiftly neutralized the malware infecting Blackwood Group's systems.

Within minutes, the cyberattack ceased. Negative online chatter dwindled. Blackwood Group's stock began stabilizing.

Liam's call came through instantly. "Boss, what the hell? We were just gaining momentum! Why shut it down now?" His voice crackled with frustration through the phone.

Vivian swirled her coffee absentmindedly. "We got what we needed. No point in overkill."

"Bullshit." Liam scoffed. "This is about Nathaniel, isn't it? That protective stunt he pulled got to you."

The past week's digital siege had leaked Blackwood Group's client data. Several major partners had already defected to their newly established competitor - a front company run by Liam, but secretly owned by Vivian.

"You're still hung up on him after four years," Liam pressed. "It's understandable, but dangerous."

Vivian's grip tightened around her mug. She couldn't deny Nathaniel taking that bullet for her had stirred something.

"Listen," Liam's tone turned grave. "That bastard just placed a $150 million bounty on Phoenix's head. Even Julian Blackthorn came out of retirement for this hunt. When Nathaniel discovers you're Phoenix..."

Vivian's lips curved. "Julian's joining? Interesting."

After hanging up, she rested a hand on her growing abdomen. "Don't worry, my loves. Mommy will secure your future before you arrive."

The unsigned divorce papers gnawed at her. Nathaniel should've returned them days ago. This delay jeopardized her plans for Blackwood Legal.

She couldn't wait any longer.

At Blackwood Group headquarters, employees greeted her warmly. "Mrs. Blackwood!"

Vivian forced a smile. Her past lunch deliveries to Nathaniel's office - always with extras for staff - had made her popular. Now the familiarity chafed.

Nathaniel's secretary paled when Vivian approached. "H-he's in a meeting, Mrs. Blackwood."

"I'll wait." Vivian's gaze locked onto the office door.

The secretary fidgeted. "It's... not a good time."

Something was off. Vivian's instincts screamed it. Without another word, she strode past the flustered assistant and pushed the door open.

The scene inside froze her in place.
###Chapter 22

Vivian flashed a calm smile at the secretary.

"Relax, I've got this."

With that, she straightened her shoulders and walked into Ethan's office with purpose. Just as she'd anticipated, Cassandra Delacroix was there.

The woman was clinging to Ethan, tears streaking her cheeks, but she immediately pulled away when Vivian entered—like a guilty child caught with stolen candy.

"Mrs. Lockhart, please don't misunderstand, we were just—"

"Spare me." Vivian held up a hand. She turned to Ethan, her voice cool. "Apologies for interrupting your little moment, Mr. Blackwood, but I'm here for the divorce settlement. Once you sign, I'll be out of your hair."

Ethan leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. "That urgent, is it?"

What kind of game is he playing now? Vivian clenched her jaw, forcing down the impulse to slap him. "What do you think?"

"There's still twenty days until the divorce is finalized." His tone was flat. "I don't see the rush."

Her nails dug into her palms. She'd never wanted to punch someone more in her life.

Did that hit to the head actually damage his brain?

He's the one who served me divorce papers! The one who threw me out the same night so his mistress could move in! And now he's suddenly in no hurry?

"Are you joking?" Vivian gestured sharply at Cassandra's swollen stomach. "Look at her. That baby isn't going to wait, even if you are. Just sign the damn papers."

Ethan smirked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "How thoughtful of my soon-to-be ex-wife. But why would I let go of someone as remarkable as you so easily?"

Both Vivian and Cassandra stiffened.

What the hell does he want? Vivian's patience snapped. He demanded the divorce, and now he's refusing to sign? Who does he think he is—some kind of king making decrees?

Cassandra cut in, her voice sweet but edged with venom. "Ethan, I can wait, but Mrs. Lockhart seems... impatient. Maybe she's already found someone else. Why not just sign and put her out of her misery?"

The temperature in the room plummeted. Ethan's jaw tightened, his displeasure palpable.

Vivian almost denied the accusation—but then she realized it might work in her favor. She stayed silent, letting the implication hang in the air.

Cassandra swallowed nervously and pressed on. "Since there's no love between you two, wouldn't it be better to just... let go?"

"Exactly," Vivian agreed.

The words stung, but they were true. Ethan had never loved her—so why was he dragging this out?

Is this just another way to torment me?

"Leave," Ethan ordered coldly.

Cassandra shot Vivian a smug glance. "You should go, Mrs. Lockhart. I'll talk to Ethan for you."

But then Ethan clarified, his voice sharp. "You leave, Cassandra."

Her face flushed crimson. "Oh. I—I'll go, then."

The door clicked shut, leaving only the two of them.

Ethan stood, his movements deliberate as he closed the distance between them.

Vivian tensed. "What are you doing?"

He caged her against the desk, his voice a low growl. "Tell me. Is there really someone else?"
###Chapter 23

The space between them crackled with tension.

After four years of marriage, they'd never stood this close. Vivian's cheeks burned as she struggled to steady her breath.

"Mr. Blackwood, I hope you'll give us your blessing. After all, I've already given you mine."

Ethan's gaze turned stormy. "Who is it? Theodore Osborne's youngest boy? That kid's three years your junior."

His words ignited her temper. Since when did age matter? Men date women decades younger without judgment.

"What's it to you?" She tilted her chin. "Younger men adore experienced women these days. His relentless pursuit was... irresistible."

"I don't care about the age gap," Ethan gritted out. "But Liam Osborne is forbidden. Ask anyone—the boy's a notorious playboy. Someone like you could never handle him."

Vivian's nails bit into her palms. Why does he care? We're getting divorced!

Since when does the great Nathaniel Blackwood, the untouchable ice prince, concern himself with his ex-wife's dating life?

"Whether I can 'handle' him isn't your business." Her laugh was sharp. "Maybe I enjoy a challenge. Maybe danger excites me."

She thrust the papers forward. "You're a busy man. Just sign these so we can both move on."

When he didn't react, she pulled out her phone. "Lost your copy? No matter—I've got the PDF right here. We can print new ones immediately."

Her eagerness to sever ties sent a dark ripple through him. Four years of marriage—even a hollow one—meant something. This felt like theft.

"What if I refuse?" Ethan pocketed his hands, arrogance in every line of his body.

"Seriously?" Her scoff could have frosted glass. Typical man. Gorgeous face, impeccable reputation, rotten core.

"Fine. Let's play your game." Her fingers flew across the screen.

Ethan frowned. "What are you doing?"

This fiery woman bore no resemblance to the docile wife he remembered. Who was this defiant creature?

A moment later, Vivian aimed her phone at him with a smirk.

"Live streaming."

"Have you lost your mind?"

On screen, her expression crumpled into melodramatic despair. "Help me, everyone! I—I can't take this anymore!"

"This is my husband, Nathaniel Blackwood—CEO of Blackwood Group, scion of Harborview City's elite..."

"Today I discovered his affair! His mistress is pregnant! Yet he refuses to sign our divorce, denying me even a cent of support!"

Her voice trembled. "Do the wealthy think they're above morality? Must the victim suffer while the cheater prospers?"

Ethan stared, dumbfounded. This absurd performance can't possibly—

His phone rang. Ethan Young's panicked voice crackled through. "Sir! Mrs. Blackwood is sobbing on our corporate account! Thirty million viewers are calling you a adulterer! They're threatening to boycott all Blackwood projects!"

"Whatever lovers' quarrel this is, take it offline!" his secretary begged. "The stream's going viral across every platform!"

Ethan lunged for his laptop. Sure enough, his office filled the screen on Blackwood Group's official page.

She actually did it.

The realization hit like a thunderbolt.
###Chapter 24

"Please, my love... We've been married four years. Even if you did betray me... I forgive you. Because... my love is real. Just... don't be so cruel to me..."

"I wasn't asking for much. Just the smallest firm under your name. You can't divorce me and leave me with nothing, can you? I'll starve!"

"I'll bless your new love... I'll disappear quietly for your sake! I won't disturb you—I just want you happy!"

Vivian's performance was flawless. Tears streamed down her face, the perfect picture of a wronged wife. The live chat exploded with outrage as viewers ate it up.

[What a monster! Nathaniel Blackwood really is as heartless as they say! How can he treat her like this?!]

[Men like him deserve to burn! That firm is nothing to him!]

[Scum! Him and that mistress should rot!]

[Unfollowing now! All men are trash! Wasted good looks on a devil!]

Nathaniel was seething. He didn’t even have time to question how she’d hacked into the company’s official account. All he wanted was to shut this down.

"End this now!" he snarled.

Vivian ignored him, keeping the camera trained on his furious face as she sobbed.

"Darling, please don’t shout at me. Don’t blame me... I had no choice but to negotiate like this!"

"My parents are gone... I’m alone in this world. I can’t fight your family. The only people who’ll listen... are the ones watching right now."

The unspoken threat was clear—she wouldn’t stop streaming until he signed the papers.

"Hand it over!" Nathaniel growled, lunging for her phone.

Vivian dodged effortlessly.

"What are you doing, darling? Let’s talk this through. No need for violence! And mind your image—we’re live!"

"You think that was rough?" He closed the distance, seizing her wrists with a dangerous smirk. "Let me show you real roughness."

He yanked her against him, their bodies colliding.

The phone clattered to the floor, camera pointed at the ceiling. The audience was left to wildly speculate what was happening between them.

[Where’d they go?! What’s happening?!]

[Divorce? More like foreplay!]

[Are we seriously getting this for free?!]

[Oh my god, they’re totally making up right now!]

Vivian hadn’t expected this. Her face burned as she struggled. "Nathaniel Blackwood! We’re live!"

"My reputation’s already ruined. Might as well enjoy myself." His grip tightened as he whispered against her ear, breath hot.

After years of marriage, he’d never realized how intoxicating she was—her scent, the way she melted against him. He didn’t want to let go.

But Vivian’s heart was ice.

Once, she’d dreamed of his touch. Now? She’d rather break her own arm than stay in his embrace.

"You don’t care about your image? Fine." She inhaled sharply—then screamed.

"AH! Darling, stop hitting me! PLEASE!"

"I’ll drop everything! I’ll obey! Just don’t hurt me!"

"HELP! Someone call the police! He’s going to kill me!"

Nathaniel froze, all warmth vanishing.

This woman... is ruthless.

Just then, the office doors burst open—a furious crowd storming in.
###Chapter 25

"Mr. Blackwood, stop this! Let go of Mrs. Lockhart!"

"You do realize domestic violence is a felony, right? Mrs. Lockhart is an incredible woman! She loves you so much! How could you lay a hand on her?"

"If you dare hurt her again, we’re walking out—and filing charges against you for abuse!"

The voices belonged to employees of Blackwood Group—the same ones Vivian had secretly been slipping lunchboxes to. Those extra pastries had finally paid off.

The scene unfolding was… awkward, to say the least.

From a distance, it looked like Nathaniel was overpowering Vivian, his towering frame looming over her delicate figure. To any bystander, it was infuriating.

The commotion had drawn a crowd. Even Ethan Young, Nathaniel’s most loyal assistant, was siding with Vivian this time.

"Mr. Blackwood, I’ll be blunt."

"Mrs. Lockhart is amazing, and you know it. For years, she’s been nothing but devoted. And yet you cheated on her—"

"And now you’re refusing to sign the settlement? That’s just cruel." Ethan glared, unbothered by the risk of losing his job.

"Wait… could it be you’re still in love with her? Is that why you won’t sign, sir?"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd.

"That’s got to be it! The affair was just a stupid mistake—he still loves her deep down!"

"How could any mistress compare to Mrs. Lockhart? He just wanted to spice things up!"

"Mr. Blackwood, swallow your pride. Admit you love her! If you apologize sincerely, she’ll forgive you!"

"Honestly, I’d drop to my knees right now. Embarrassing? Maybe. But she’s worth it!"

They knew speaking up could cost them their jobs, but they were all-in to save their favorite power couple.

Vivian hadn’t expected things to escalate like this.

After a stunned pause, she snapped back to reality and played along. "Do you really still love me, darling? Is that why you’re being difficult? Just to keep me close?"

"If you do, just say it! No need to hide. They’re right—I’ll forgive you if you beg properly."

"Vivian Lockhart!" Nathaniel’s glare burned into her, his jaw clenched in fury.

For all his business prowess, he was utterly defenseless against her schemes.

"Stop deluding yourself! Loving you? Impossible!"

He refused to let this farce continue. Yanking open his desk drawer, he pulled out the revised divorce papers and signed them with a sharp stroke.

"You just wanted my signature? Here. Take it." He flung the document at her, his voice icy.

At the same moment, Vivian ended the live stream. Smirking, she picked up the papers. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood. Initiate the ownership transfer as soon as possible."

His words stung, but it didn’t matter. She’d won.

Clutching the signed papers, she strode out of Blackwood Group with a triumphant smile.

"Mrs. Lockhart, wait!" Ethan called after her.

She turned. "Yes?"

Since Nathaniel often used Ethan as a messenger, they were familiar. She’d always found him easy to talk to.

"Just… I wanted to apologize for his behavior."

"And… why Hunts & Co.? Those three lawyers are useless. The firm’s practically worthless. You’re getting nothing from this divorce."

Vivian’s lips curved mysteriously. "You’ll understand soon enough."
###Chapter 26

The fallout from the live stream was catastrophic for Ethan Blackwood.

Social media exploded with outrage. Every platform flooded with condemnations of his behavior. The most damning revelations? His affair with Cassandra Delacroix—his own brother's ex-girlfriend.

Public fury reached a boiling point.

Blackwood Group, still reeling from the cyberattack, took another hit. Stock prices plummeted the moment the scandal broke.

"Ethan, what the hell happened in that broadcast? Look at how you treated Vivian! How could my son be such a disgrace?"

"Your infidelity is trending everywhere! Are you proud of yourself?"

"And you dared to lay hands on her! If I weren't overseas securing a heart donor for your grandfather's surgery, I'd make sure you never see daylight again!"

Dawn had barely broken, and Ethan was already being berated by his father.

He adjusted his tie, jaw tight. "It was staged. You've been fooled by that woman."

"Bullshit!"

Leonard Kingsley was so furious he nearly cursed. "I know Vivian. She's principled and loyal! If you hadn't pushed her to the brink, why would she expose our family's private matters?"

Principled? Loyal?

Ethan nearly laughed.

Once, he might have agreed. But now? Vivian Lockhart was nothing but a cunning, infuriating vixen.

"Or maybe..." Leonard's tone turned sly. "You still love her, like the rumors say. Is that why you refused to sign the divorce papers? Don't want to let her go?"

Ethan's voice turned glacial. "I don't love her. Never will."

Leonard exhaled sharply. "Fine. Handle this mess. Especially the accusations online."

"Your grandfather's in the hospital with no internet access. If he finds out and his condition worsens—it's on you."

Silence settled over Ethan's office after the call ended.

Leaning back, he stared at the ceiling, mind racing. Despite his denial, Vivian consumed his thoughts.

I underestimated you, Isabella Lockhart.

A knock interrupted him.

"Enter."

His expression hardened instantly.

Rachel Miles stepped in. "Mr. Blackwood, PR has suppressed the live stream backlash. We've paid media outlets to run favorable pieces."

She hesitated.

"But?"

"Public sentiment is... divided. One faction is calling you an abusive cheater, demanding Blackwood Group's downfall."

Ethan's fingers tightened around his pen.

"The other side..." Rachel winced. "They're convinced you and Mrs. Blackwood were flirting. They've romanticized the whole thing."

His jaw clenched.

"The war between these factions is keeping the scandal alive. We can't control the narrative fast enough."

Ethan exhaled sharply. "Solutions?"

"PR has a proposal. It could calm the storm and restore Blackwood Group's image."

She swallowed.

"But you won't like it."
###Chapter 27

Ethan Blackwood's patience had reached its limit.

"Get to the point. What's the problem?"

"Our analysis shows public sentiment has shifted dramatically. The citizens are outraged over how Vivian Lockhart was treated."

"If you could publicly reconcile with Mrs. Lockhart—show the world you've made amends—we might salvage your reputation," Rachel suggested, avoiding his piercing gaze.

She knew her boss too well. Pride was his armor. To the world, he was Newport City’s untouchable king. Now they expected him to kneel before the woman he’d cast aside?

Impossible.

"No." His refusal was absolute. "If they want to waste their time gossiping, let them."

A cold smirk curled his lips. "They’re delusional if they think they can touch Blackwood Group."

Blackwood Group’s empire spanned industries—real estate, tech, luxury brands, even defense contracts. Public outrage wouldn’t topple them.

"Flood the platforms with paid moderators. Delete every post about that livestream," he commanded. "You have seventy-two hours. I don’t care how it’s done."

Rachel stifled a sigh. "We’ll allocate more PR funds. But sir, this won’t address the root—"

"Enough."

As she turned to leave, his voice halted her.

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

He shoved his coffee cup forward, disgust twisting his features. "What did you do to this? It tastes like sludge."

Coffee was his ritual. Though no connoisseur, he knew quality. This wasn’t it.

"The beans changed," Rachel admitted.

"Then change them back."

"That’s... not possible. Mrs. Lockhart supplied them personally. She’d bring a fresh batch weekly."

A beat of silence.

"Vivian did that?"

Rachel seized her chance. "For years. The cakes you praised? The ashtray you refuse to replace? All from her."

A nervous laugh escaped her. "The staff called her 'Lady Grace.' She never took credit."

Ethan’s gaze flickered to the silver ashtray, the velvet cushion by the window—subtle touches he’d never questioned.

His chest tightened.

"Sir, I’ll say this even if you fire me. She loved you. You shouldn’t have humiliated her."

Silence.

Rachel hesitated, then added, "I’m actually a moderator for 'Lockhart’s Secret Heart'—your biggest fan forum. There’s this fanfic series that—"

"Leave."

Alone, Ethan stared at his screen. Against his better judgment, he searched the forum.

The top post froze him mid-scroll.
###Chapter 28

Ethan Blackwood never anticipated discovering 300,000 active users in this forum. It ranked among the top five most engaged communities on the entire platform.

He'd foolishly assumed it was just a niche fan group. But they moved like an army. No wonder a single livestream had catapulted him into trending headlines.

His fingers scrolled relentlessly, eyes locked on the screen.

[This is everything! Look at them! Just LOOK!]

[Oh my god, Vivian's gaze is pure devotion. That man doesn’t deserve her!]

[Classic opposites attract—icy CEO Ethan Blackwood secretly adores his wife just as much as she loves him!]

Threads exploded every few minutes—old photos, conspiracy theories, even fabricated dialogues between him and Vivian.

For the first time, Ethan realized how many pictures existed of them together. More startling was how openly Vivian’s affection shone in every image.

One post dominated the feed with an alarming number of likes. A fanfiction by Lockhart_Hunter.

[Their first encounter happened on a storm-swept summer night. While others fled the rain, their eyes met across the crowded street…]

Ethan’s pulse spiked. He tapped the link—only for a 404 error to mock him. The post had vanished.

"Damn it." His jaw clenched. He’d wanted to read just a little more.

Now he understood the forum’s grip. These writers were dangerously talented. Once you stepped into this world, escaping was nearly impossible.

He forced himself to exit the page. If he kept reading, he might actually start believing in whatever fantasy they’d spun about his marriage.

Night draped over the city. Despite a productive day, an odd hollowness gnawed at him.

In his silent office, Ethan scrolled absently through his phone before zoning out, lost in thought.

Meanwhile, Vivian lounged on her couch, skimming a parenting book when her phone rang. Ethan’s name flashed on the screen.

"I’m at The Crystal Rose." The call ended before she could respond.

Vivian blinked at the dead line. "What’s his problem?"

In three years of marriage, he’d never once called her directly. Everything went through his assistant, Ethan Young. Only for emergencies.

Well, this is new.

A year ago, she’d have squealed, rushed to doll up, and floated to the restaurant on cloud nine.

Now? She almost dismissed it as a prank.

Finishing her book, she watched a documentary, tinkered with code, and by 10 PM, prepared for bed with a face mask.

"Are you coming? I’ve waited two hours." His voice crackled with barely contained fury.

Vivian’s brows shot up. Is he mentally stable?

I never agreed to meet. Since when does a CEO have time to idle around for hours?

"Get here. Now." The line went dead again.

"Ugh! Unbelievable!" She flung her phone onto the couch.

How did I ever think Prince Charming wasn’t deranged? This is next-level petty.

She resolved to ignore him—until her traitorous mind conjured an image of him alone in some dim, empty restaurant.

Guilt prickled.

Fine. It’s only a mile away.

She marched out in cartoon-print pajamas, hair piled messily, face bare.

At 10:30 PM, The Crystal Rose stood deserted except for one figure by the window.

Ethan sat silhouetted against the city lights, gaze distant and unreadable. Even annoyed, Vivian’s breath hitched. Devastatingly handsome. Pity he’s insufferable.

She approached. "What’s so urgent, future ex-husband? Couldn’t this wait?"

He turned, scanning her pajamas with a sneer. "Really? This is how you show up?"

"You’re getting demoted to ‘ex’ anyway. Why bother impressing you?" She dropped into the chair opposite him. "Besides, my best version couldn’t keep you. Why waste effort now?"

His eyes locked onto hers, intensity burning. "So you did love me."
###Chapter 29

"Cough! Cough!"

Vivian Lockhart nearly spat out her lemon water when Ethan Blackwood dropped the unexpected question.

'What alternate universe did I stumble into? Since when did this ice-cold CEO become so blunt?'

"Don't flatter yourself. Who fed you that nonsense?"

She deliberately avoided eye contact while denying any past affection.

"Multiple reliable sources confirmed your deep infatuation," Ethan countered, an uncharacteristic smirk playing on his lips.

Countless women had thrown themselves at him over the years - some with lavish gifts, others with their bodies. Their advances always irritated him.

Yet the thought of Vivian's past devotion gave him an inexplicable sense of satisfaction.

"That was purely performative for the livestream. The audience didn't know the truth," Vivian replied coolly.

She'd never reveal her genuine feelings. Maintaining this facade protected what remained of her pride.

But Ethan seemed determined to play investigator, digging up buried emotions like an archaeologist uncovering ancient ruins.

"Then explain the anonymous gifts. Or the way you looked at me in every photograph. And your immediate hostility toward Cassandra Delacroix - wasn't that jealousy?"

Each question felt like salt rubbed into old wounds.

"So?" he pressed.

'What's his game? Why this sudden obsession with proving I loved him?'

'Does he want to see me broken? To confirm his irresistible charm?' Her thoughts turned bitter.

"You're the most arrogant man I've ever met, Nathaniel Blackwood," she spat.

"Whatever I felt before is irrelevant. I don't love you now, and I never will again."

"If you dragged me here just for some pathetic ego boost, you're even more pathetic than I thought."

As Vivian stood to leave, their steaks arrived - premium cuts with mesmerizing blue flames dancing across the surface.

Ethan sliced his steak with practiced elegance. "Such strong reactions for someone who claims indifference. Sit. We have business to discuss."

Vivian's fists clenched. Her outburst had betrayed her, while Ethan remained infuriatingly composed.

'Not this time.' She sat back down and attacked her steak with vengeance, deciding to make him pay for this expensive meal.

The dining room fell silent. Ironically, this marked one of their rare private meals during their entire marriage.

Hunger overcame pride as Vivian devoured large bites, her cheeks puffing like a chipmunk storing nuts.

Ethan's lips quirked at the transformation. The old Vivian had eaten with restrained, ladylike precision - never speaking out of turn, never showing temper.

Who knew divorce would unleash this fiery version?

"Have you considered the fallout from your little stunt?" Ethan set down his utensils.

"My stunt?" Vivian scoffed. "Your PR team excels at media manipulation. Handle it however you please."

"So I have your permission?" His smile turned predatory.

"Isn't that your default setting, Mr. Blackwood?"

Vivian studied him warily. 'He's acting completely deranged.'

Then Ethan snapped his fingers.

The restaurant plunged into darkness except for a single spotlight illuminating Vivian.

Before she could react, Ethan appeared behind her holding sunflowers - her favorite.

Vivian recoiled against her chair, staring up in horrified confusion.

"Sunflowers symbolize steadfast devotion," Ethan murmured in a tone straight from a romance novel. "Just like my feelings for you."

"I'm sorry, darling."

"I love you."

Then he cradled her face and kissed her.
###Chapter 30

Vivian's mind went blank as her body tensed. Though she'd shared a bed with the man before, this was their first actual kiss.

Just as she'd imagined, his lips were cool, yet they set her entire being aflame.

Her clenched fists gradually relaxed as she surrendered to the moment, eyelids fluttering shut in his unexpected embrace.

"Cut! That's a wrap!" a male voice called from the shadows moments later.

The restaurant's lights flickered back on.

Reality came crashing down as Vivian shoved Ethan away with visible revulsion.

'What just happened?'

'Was I really so lost in the moment that I kissed my soon-to-be ex-husband?'

She scrubbed at her lips with the back of her hand, which only darkened Ethan's expression.

"Enjoyed it that much, did you?" he taunted.

Vivian's hands balled into fists again. "What the hell was that, Blackwood? Explain yourself."

Ethan slid his hands into his pockets with that infuriating smirk. "Just taking notes from the master."

His gaze dropped to her swollen pink lips - petals after rain - stirring something primal within him.

A round-faced cameraman approached, beaming. "Mr. Blackwood, that was pure magic! More passionate than any romance film!"

"The viewers who called you heartless are now shipping you two like crazy!"

"Best damage control ever! Though you might've oversold it - some viewers think it looked too real. We ran over schedule because you wouldn't stop."

Ethan shrugged. "Just doing my job."

The pieces clicked for Vivian. She'd been used as a prop in Ethan's PR stunt.

'So this is how he fixes his reputation?'

'Pathetic. And I fell for it.'

She found Ethan's actions despicable, but her own reaction unforgivable.

'My heart actually raced. How embarrassingly naive.'

"Mr. Blackwood, this livestream solved our crisis overnight-"

"Way more effective than deleting comments, and cheaper too," the cameraman added, mopping his brow. As Blackwood Group's PR lead, he could finally sleep soundly.

"So I've done Blackwood Group a huge favor?" Vivian asked sweetly.

"Absolutely! You were flawless! The chemistry was electric!"

"Mrs. Blackwood, your shy reactions were perfect! I was shaking from excitement!"

Vivian's smile turned glacial as she faced Ethan. "Then where's my compensation, Mr. Blackwood?"

"What do you want?" he snapped, never able to predict her.

"This," she purred, stepping closer. Before he could react, her palm connected sharply with his cheek.

The restaurant froze.

'Did Mrs. Blackwood just slap the feared Blackwood heir?'

The crimson handprint left no doubt. Everyone braced for his legendary temper to erupt.

Instead, Ethan calmly licked blood from his lip. "Care to explain?"

Vivian shrugged. "Consider it my consulting fee. I considered asking for millions, but this was far more satisfying."

'Using me like some cheap actress and toying with my emotions? He's lucky I stopped at one slap.'

She turned to leave, but Ethan seized her wrist. "You think you can just walk away after that?"
###Chapter 31

Vivian spun around, her gaze locking onto the hand gripping her wrist. Her expression remained unreadable. "Or what?" she challenged, voice steady. "Planning to retaliate, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathaniel's silence was heavy, his piercing stare holding a storm of unspoken words.

She took a bold step forward, closing the distance between them until their breaths mingled. A mocking smile curled her lips. "The great Nathaniel Blackwood, known for his vindictiveness. Why pretend? If you're angry, just hit back."

He didn’t move. Instead, his sharp glance at the surrounding staff sent them scattering.

Within moments, the upscale restaurant was empty except for them.

Nathaniel released her, exhaling slowly. "I never intended to use you. The love I claimed might have been a lie, but my regret is real."

The chandelier's glow highlighted his striking features, making him look almost otherworldly. So close, yet untouchable.

"Are you... apologizing?" Vivian blinked, stunned. The proud, arrogant Nathaniel Blackwood lowering himself to say sorry? Unthinkable.

"You misheard." He cleared his throat, discomfort flashing across his face before his usual icy mask slid back into place. "But since we're here—your little stunt with the livestream severely damaged Blackwood Group. You’re responsible for fixing it."

"I already played along with your act tonight!" she snapped. "What more do you want?"

She could’ve ruined him. Demanded a fortune. But despite everything, the love she once had for him still lingered, holding her back.

"The public loves us together," Nathaniel stated, as if it were fact. "Even after the divorce, we’ll need to maintain appearances." His tone turned commanding. "You’re still legally my wife. Stay away from Julian Montgomery. Use the Blackwood name freely. Spend whatever you want. And if anyone gives you trouble, call me."

Vivian gaped. Did he just—?

"Mr. Blackwood," she hissed, "have you forgotten? Our divorce is nearly final. You have zero say in my life. You’re not my keeper. You’re certainly not God."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Your mistress is carrying your child, yet here you are, still using your ex-wife to protect your precious image. Disgusting. And rescue me? You ignored me for years! Your empty promises make me sick."

For the first time, fury burned so hot she couldn’t stand being near him.

"Grandfather’s heart surgery is in two days," Nathaniel said quietly, watching her. "The doctors warned against stress."

Vivian stiffened.

Alfred Blackwood had been the only one in that family who treated her with kindness. If their divorce hurt him...

Nathaniel’s voice softened, seeing her hesitation. "Just think about it. If you agree, I’ll pick you up tomorrow. Where are you staying now? Send me the address."

Her jaw clenched. Since when did Nathaniel Blackwood act like some persistent rogue?

"None of your business!" She turned on her heel and stormed out.

That night, sleep eluded her. His face, his words, the memory of his lips on hers—it all churned inside her like a tempest.

Damn it, Vivian Lockhart. Wake up! He’s hurt you enough. Stop letting him under your skin.

She finally drifted off, only to be jolted awake by her phone at dawn.

"Viv! Are you okay? Did that bastard do something to you? Should we call the police?" Sophia’s frantic voice crackled through the line.

"What? Why?" Vivian rubbed her eyes, groggy.

"Have you seen the news? They caught everything on camera!" Sophia’s outrage was palpable. "Tell me you didn’t sleep with him. Please say you didn’t!"
###Chapter 32

"With who?" Vivian's confusion was evident as she struggled to comprehend Sophia's frantic words. She'd learned long ago not to take her best friend's dramatics too seriously.

"Ethan Blackwood!" Sophia shrieked through the phone. "Tell me you didn't actually sleep with that bastard! I may have supported you two once, but he crossed every line imaginable! Weren't you the one demanding a divorce? How could you—"

Vivian cut her off. "Who told you that happened?" She cringed, realizing Sophia must have seen last night's livestream. "It was all performance. Yes, we kissed, but I also slapped him across the face."

The kiss had been a small price to pay for the satisfaction of seeing shock register on Ethan's perfect features when her palm connected with his cheek. "Worth every second," Vivian muttered.

"Oh my god, you hit him?" Sophia's tone shifted to impressed before turning serious again. "But that doesn't excuse sleeping with him! Swear to me nothing happened. The paparazzi photos show you both returning to Sunrise Heights together. Is he there with you now?"

"Don't be absurd!" Vivian scoffed, though her stomach dropped. She had no memory of Ethan accompanying her home. The photos Sophia sent showed them entering the luxury apartment building within minutes of each other.

Sunrise Heights contained only two exclusive units. Nathan Prescott had secured it for her personally. She'd guarded her privacy fiercely, never disclosing her address to anyone.

Which meant only one explanation: Ethan was stalking her.

"That manipulative bastard." Ice flooded Vivian's veins.

She ended the call with Sophia and immediately dialed Ethan's private number.

His sleep-roughened voice answered with surprise. "Vivian?"

"Cut the act, Blackwood," she spat. "How pathetic can you be? Following me like some common stalker? I detest mind games. Our divorce is happening whether you like it or not. One more stunt like this and I'm filing a restraining order."

A beat of silence. Then Ethan's voice turned glacial. "Explain yourself."

"Don't play dumb! The tabloids have photos of you entering Sunrise Heights last night and not leaving. Are you lurking outside my door right now? That cold CEO persona was always a front—you're just a creep who can't take no for an answer!"

"You live at Sunrise Heights?" Ethan ignored her tirade, zeroing in on the address.

The doorbell chimed, cutting through Vivian's mounting fury. Assuming it was her breakfast delivery, she hung up and stormed to the door in her sleep shorts and barely-there camisole.

Her blood turned to fire when she yanked the door open to find Ethan standing there, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit, his expression unreadable.

"You psycho!" She instinctively crossed her arms over her chest. "Were you camped out here all night? I'm calling security!"

Ethan's gaze flickered over her disheveled state. "Cute pajamas. Though that neckline is dangerously low. Might want to button up before answering doors."

Heat flooded Vivian's cheeks. "Eyes up here, pervert!"

A muscle ticked in Ethan's jaw. "No need for modesty. We're still married, in case you've forgotten."

"Answer me!" Vivian's hands balled into fists. "Why were you following me? And what the hell are you doing at my home?"
###Chapter 33

"You need to stop watching those ridiculous dramas." Ethan scoffed. "I've lived in the opposite unit for four years. If anyone's stalking anyone here, it's you."

"What did you just say? You live across from me?" Only then did Vivian notice the slightly open door of the neighboring apartment. She scratched her head awkwardly, wishing the floor would swallow her whole.

So he wasn’t following me… He actually lives here! And I just called him every name in the book! Now I look like the delusional one, thinking he was obsessed with me!

Ethan’s sharp gaze swept across her living space before landing on her bedroom door.

"Your bedroom looks nothing like mine." He strode toward it, clearly intending to walk right in.

Vivian’s blood ran cold. A stack of parenting books lay scattered across her bed. If he sees those, he’ll know about the baby!

"Stop!" She lunged in front of him, blocking the doorway.

"Move," Ethan commanded. As a man who always got his way, he wasn’t used to being denied.

"Absolutely not!" She spread her arms wide, refusing to budge. Anger flared in her chest. "Since when are we best friends? What makes you think you can just waltz into my bedroom?"

"I’m your husband." He loomed over her, his darkening eyes boring into hers. "Unless… you’re hiding someone in there?"

"Ethan Blackwood, watch your mouth!" Vivian seethed. If he keeps pushing, I’ll have to take him down. My combat training should make this easy. Oh, the look on his face when he hits the floor…

"You’re flashing me again," he pointed out, his tone dripping with mock concern.

"You—!" She instinctively crossed her arms over her chest, falling right into his trap.

Ethan took advantage of her distraction, slipping past her into the bedroom. The space was airy—floor-to-ceiling windows, a sleek wardrobe, a minimalist desk, and a bed draped in pastel pink.

"Didn’t take you for the frilly type. Hello Kitty sheets? Didn’t peg you as the nostalgic sort." His smirk widened as he moved toward the bed.

Vivian’s pulse spiked. The books were right there, next to her pillow.

"Don’t you dare!" She launched herself at him, knocking him onto the mattress and pinning him down.

Ethan blinked up at her, stunned. His eyes narrowed. "What the hell are you doing?"

How is she this strong? He strained against her grip but couldn’t break free.

"I just—uh—you’re really distracting, okay?" She stammered, subtly shoving the books under the pillow.

Her knee pressed into a pressure point on his abdomen, rendering him immobile. It was like a temporary paralysis—no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t move.

Watching his usually composed face flush with frustration, Vivian finally understood why he enjoyed being in control so much. Right now, he looked downright adorable.

"Behave," she murmured, tracing his sharp jawline. "Or I won’t let you up."

"Vivian. Get. Off." His voice was a dangerous growl.

"Or what?"

His glare could have melted steel. How is she this heavy? I’ve never been humiliated like this in my life.

After a moment, she finally relented, lifting her knee.

The second Ethan could move, he flipped her beneath him, caging her in with his muscular frame.

"Had your fun?" His gaze dropped to her lips, the memory of last night’s kiss flooding back. This time, he wanted more.

Ring ring ring!

His phone shattered the tension.
###Chapter 34

Ethan's brow furrowed as he snatched up the ringing phone, his expression darkening.

"Mr. Blackwood, the notorious hacker Julian Blackthorn has arrived at Blackwood Group headquarters. He claims he can uncover Scarlet Phoenix's identity—and insists on speaking with you immediately."

A slow smirk curled Ethan's lips.

"So… the man who humiliated Blackwood Group is finally going to be exposed?" His voice dripped with cold amusement. "Fascinating."

"Tell him to wait. I'm on my way." He ended the call, adjusting his cuffs with sharp, deliberate movements. The warmth that had lingered in his gaze moments before vanished, replaced by icy calculation.

Vivian had been close enough to overhear every word.

She'd wanted to meet Julian Blackthorn for months—now that the chance had fallen into her lap, she wasn't about to let it slip away.

"Leaving so soon, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice was soft, but her eyes gleamed with hidden intent.

"Business at headquarters."

"I'll come with you."

Ethan turned sharply, studying her with narrowed eyes. "What are you plotting now?"

He didn't trust that innocent look on her face. Not when he knew how quickly she could flip from sweet to scheming.

"Plotting?" Vivian laughed, tilting her head. "You're the untouchable CEO of Blackwood Group. Why would I dare cross you?"

Ethan's expression remained unreadable. He knew she was lying—but he was curious how far she'd take this act.

Vivian slid off the bed, draping a shawl over her shoulders. "I thought about your offer last night. I'll keep playing the dutiful wife."

"Really?" Surprise flickered in his eyes.

She held up a hand before he could respond. "Don't thank me. This isn't for you—or the Blackwoods. It's for Alfred."

That much was true. She'd repaid the family's kindness tenfold. But Alfred Blackwood was different. He'd been more of a grandfather to her than her own blood. She wouldn't let his health suffer because of their failed marriage.

Ethan didn't press further. "I'll wait outside," he said flatly before leaving.

The moment the door closed, Vivian yanked open her closet. She slipped into a sleek sheath dress, pausing at the mirror. Her hand drifted to her stomach.

Was it just her, or had it grown slightly?

Time's running out. I need to move faster.

The Rolls-Royce pulled up to Blackwood Group's towering headquarters. Employees whispered excitedly as Vivian stepped out, her arm linked with Ethan's.

"Oh my god, they're back together!"

"That mistress never stood a chance. He's always loved her!"

Ethan Young approached, eyebrows raised at their display. But with urgent matters at hand, he didn't question it.

"Mr. Blackwood, Julian is in the tech department. Arrogant bastard said he'd only talk to you—and won't wait long."

Ethan's jaw tightened. Without a word, he strode toward the elevator. Vivian followed.

"Mrs. Blackwood, perhaps you'd prefer the new patisserie downstairs?" Ethan Young suggested delicately.

The meeting involved classified intel—and he doubted she'd understand any of it.

"She stays." Ethan didn't glance back, clearly sharing the same assumption.

The private elevator ascended to the 16th floor.

"Ten. Nine. Eight..."

A lazy, mocking countdown echoed from the tech department.

"Three seconds left. If the great CEO doesn't show, I'm gone."
###Chapter 35

A man lounged in designer clothes, boots propped arrogantly on the desk like some rebellious troublemaker. He spun lazily in his office chair, radiating complete disregard for everyone present.

His baseball cap shadowed half his face, revealing only a razor-sharp nose and smirk-thin lips. This was the undisputed legend of the cyber world - four-time Global Hackers Union champion, one of only two mythical figures in hacking history - Julian Blackthorn.

"Mr. Blackthorn! Mr. Blackwood will be here momentarily!"

"Let me get you some coffee! You must be exhausted from waiting!"

Tech department employees swarmed their idol like groupies, begging for selfies and autographs in a frankly embarrassing display.

"Don't you people have jobs?!" Ethan Young roared, veins bulging at the unprofessional scene.

The moment Nathaniel Blackwood's imposing presence filled the doorway, the starstruck employees scattered like frightened mice.

"My apologies for the delay, Mr. Blackthorn. May I present Mr. Nathaniel Blackwood of Blackwood Group." Young performed the introductions with diplomatic care, terrified of offending either powerhouse.

Julian remained slouched in his chair, making zero effort to rise or extend a hand.

He tilted his head, that infuriating smirk widening as he visually dissected the CEO.

Nathaniel returned the appraisal with equal intensity, looming over the cocky hacker like a thundercloud.

"So you're the infamous Nathaniel Blackwood," Julian drawled. "Internet's favorite villain these days - the bastard who knocked up his mistress while divorcing his wife?"

The entire room gasped.

Beside Nathaniel, Isabella Lockhart thought dryly, 'This hacker's personality matches his coding style - pure offensive warfare.'

"Ha! Excellent joke, Mr. Blackthorn!" Young forced a laugh, shooting nervous glances at his seething boss.

Nathaniel ignored the jab. "Can you actually identify Scarlet Phoenix?"

Julian sprang to his feet, eyes flashing. "Questioning my skills? I don't waste time on lost causes."

His fingers flew across the keyboard behind him. "Three days coding this tracker. It'll trace the virus that breached your systems straight to its creator."

The hacker's excitement grew with each keystroke. "Give me fifteen minutes, and Scarlet Phoenix's entire identity will be splashed across every screen in this building!"

The cyber world knew only two legends - Julian Blackthorn, the unstoppable offensive force, and Scarlet Phoenix, the impenetrable defense. Eternal rivals, always neck-and-neck in competitions.

Until four years ago, when Phoenix edged out a narrow victory... then vanished. The legend grew until hackers spoke of them in whispers - the digital Bonnie and Clyde.

Julian became obsessed, vowing to unmask Phoenix at any cost.

Nathaniel studied the flashing screens with a businessman's skepticism. "Proceed."

"Or what?" Julian smirked. "Your money means nothing to me."

"Name your price."

"Simple." The hacker's grin turned predatory. "When I expose them, you'll use your considerable influence to make Scarlet Phoenix publicly acknowledge my superiority. Worldwide broadcast. And they'll call me 'Daddy Blackthorn' on every major network."

'This arrogant child,' Isabella thought, suppressing an eye roll. 'All those rumors about a brooding cyber prince - lies. Handsome? Sure. But maturity of a prepubescent troll.'

"Excuse me," she murmured, slipping toward the exit.

'Want me to call you Daddy?' Her lips curled. 'Let Mommy show you how it's really done.'
###Chapter 36

"Deal." Nathaniel's piercing stare locked onto the flashing 'Execute' command on the monitor. "Proceed."

"Perfect!" Julian Blackthorn clicked the button without hesitation.

The room fell silent. Every pair of eyes was glued to the screen. Scarlet Phoenix's fans clutched their fists, pulses racing.

"Almost there!"

"The legendary hacker Scarlet Phoenix—her identity is about to be revealed!"

Fifteen minutes passed in a blink. The crowd began counting down.

"10... 9... 8... 7..."

Then, Isabella strolled back in, arms crossed.

"Still not done?" Her voice dripped with amusement as she eyed Julian's deepening scowl. "Are you sure your code works? Because I spotted a critical flaw. Imagine humiliating yourself in front of everyone—calling someone Daddy when you can't even debug properly."

"What would a cleaning lady know about coding?" Julian scoffed, not even bothering to glance at her. Women like her—spineless, talentless, clinging to cheating husbands—were beneath him.

The spectators rolled their eyes. Julian's code was flawless. What nonsense was she spouting?

"3... 2... 1!"

The screen flickered. The moment of truth had arrived.

Then—silence.

The image displayed was Julian's own face.

Chaos erupted.

"Told you," Isabella sang, grinning as she patted his shoulder. "Pride comes before a fall, kid."

"Impossible!" Julian's hands trembled over the keyboard. "I triple-checked every line! There’s no way—"

He frantically combed through the backend, but the code was perfect.

"Maybe next time," Isabella added sweetly, "don’t bet what you can’t afford to lose."

Each word was a needle to Julian’s pride, but he was too busy spiraling to retort.

Nathaniel’s sharp gaze lingered on Isabella. Why was she so smug? Even if the code had failed, her gloating was... suspicious.

"Pathetic," he muttered, checking his watch. "Waste of time."

He turned to leave.

The IT team exchanged disappointed glances. Legends were just that—myths. Reality always shattered them.

"Wait!" Julian suddenly straightened. "I found it."

Nathaniel arched a brow.

"The target reverse-engineered my code," Julian explained, voice tight. "They launched a counterattack, replacing the result with my own data."

Blank stares.

"Meaning," he ground out, "Scarlet Phoenix is in this room. Only someone here could’ve accessed my algorithm."

His eyes swept the crowd.

"And the only person who left mid-execution?"

A beat.

"Isabella Lockhart."
###Chapter 37

Vivian Lockhart remained perfectly composed under the weight of everyone's scrutinizing stares.

"Wait," she laughed lightly, "you can't seriously think I'm Scarlet Phoenix, can you?"

"I just stepped out to the restroom for a few minutes," she continued, feigning disbelief. "And in that time, I somehow transformed into a legendary hacker? How absurd! Should I light fireworks to celebrate this miraculous promotion?"

Ethan Young quickly jumped in. "It's obviously just a coincidence. Knowing Mrs. Blackwood, she's far too practical for such things. Her computer skills barely extend beyond streaming movies. She doesn't even play mobile games—if someone like her is Scarlet Phoenix, then I must be the damn Prime Minister!"

Though his words painted Vivian as painfully ordinary, they served their purpose. The tension in the room eased slightly as people nodded in agreement.

"Exactly," Vivian added sweetly, flashing an innocent smile. "Everyone knows how devoted I am to Nathaniel. If I were Scarlet Phoenix, I'd have moved heaven and earth to help him—never sabotage him."

"Is that so?" Nathaniel Blackwood's icy voice cut through the room. His piercing gaze locked onto her as he smirked. "Funny. I recall you've sabotaged me quite spectacularly before."

Vivian's smile stiffened. Damn him. Why did he always have to undermine her at the worst moments?

Nathaniel closed the distance between them in slow, deliberate steps. His fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. His stare was relentless, dissecting every flicker of emotion on her face.

"So," he murmured, voice dangerously soft. "Are you Scarlet Phoenix?"

A flicker of unease passed through her. She could fool the others, but Nathaniel? He missed nothing.

She forced a coy smile. "If you believe I am, then I am. If not, then I'm not."

His lips curled in cold amusement. "How delightfully evasive."

Without warning, he held out his hand. "Give me your phone."

Her pulse spiked. In this digital age, a person's deepest secrets lived on their phone—and hers held far too many to risk exposure.

"That's a hard no," she said flatly, jerking her chin free. "My privacy isn't up for negotiation."

The standoff crackled between them like live wires. The spectators held their breaths, stunned. The docile Mrs. Blackwood was defying her husband?

Julian Blackthorn, who had been silently observing, suddenly grinned beneath his cap. Fascinating.

"Oh!" He slapped his forehead theatrically. "I just realized—my code was flawed this whole time!"

Turning to the crowd, he laughed sheepishly. "My apologies, everyone. False alarm! I'll fix it immediately—no more mistakes next time!"

The tension shattered like glass.

Vivian discreetly unclenched her fists. Her hacker identity was one thing, but if Nathaniel saw her phone? The pregnancy test results alone would unleash chaos.

Her eyes flicked to Julian, who winked at her like they shared a secret. Why was he helping her?

"Anyway," Julian announced cheerfully, "I can guarantee Mrs. Blackwood isn't Scarlet Phoenix. Want to know why?"

The room leaned in.

"Because," he said, smirk widening, "Scarlet Phoenix's coding is flawless—precise, elegant, perfection. Someone that brilliant would never waste time clinging to a cheating bastard."
###Chapter 38

The tension dissipated as Haze's figure disappeared through the doors.

"If that's all," Vivian said coolly to Nathaniel, "I'll be leaving now."

She'd already played her part in their little public charade. With Haze gone, there was absolutely no reason to remain at Blackwood Group headquarters.

"Clear your evening schedule." Nathaniel's command cut through the air as he buried himself in paperwork without looking up.

His domineering tone grated on Vivian's nerves. That arrogant assumption she'd obey without question.

"For what?" she snapped.

Instead of answering, Nathaniel opened his desk drawer and produced an elegant gift box. "Eight o'clock sharp at The Grand Marquis' banquet hall," he said, pushing it across the desk. "Dress appropriately."

Vivian's eyebrows shot up. "A gift? Should I check if hell's frozen over too?"

Curiosity got the better of her. She flipped open the lid to reveal a silver designer gown - undoubtedly expensive but painfully conservative.

She opened her mouth to protest, then paused as an idea struck. A slow, mischievous smile curved her lips.

"Fine. I'll be there."

At precisely eight that evening, The Grand Marquis' valet parking resembled an auto show with its parade of luxury vehicles.

The Newport City Annual Charity Gala attracted elite society from across the country and beyond.

Vivian arrived via taxi, her drab trench coat and messy bun standing in stark contrast to the glittering attendees.

"Invitation?" The security guard blocked her path.

"I don't have one."

"Then beat it. This isn't some public fundraiser."

Clearly this man didn't keep up with society news, or he'd recognize Nathaniel Blackwood's soon-to-be-ex-wife.

Vivian drew breath to explain when a crimson Ferrari screeched to a halt nearby. Out stepped Nathaniel's cousin Charlotte Whitmore in a pink couture gown, preening like royalty.

Her entourage included her latest arm candy, Micah Larson, and... Cassandra Delacroix.

"Careful, Cassie," Charlotte cooed with uncharacteristic gentleness, supporting the pregnant woman's arm. "Remember you're carrying my cousin's heir."

Her saccharine smile vanished when she spotted Vivian. "Lockhart? What are you doing here?"

Their mutual animosity dated back to Vivian's marriage. Charlotte had never missed an opportunity to belittle her.

"Same as you," Vivian replied evenly. "Attending the gala."

Charlotte's laugh was razor-sharp. "You? The leech who's about to be tossed aside? This event's for actual society, not gold-digging trash."

"Charlotte," Cassandra interjected with false sweetness, "be civil. She's still family, technically."

"Not for long!" Charlotte turned to the guard. "She's nobody now. Don't waste courtesy on discarded wives."

Vivian smirked. "Funny, I was just thinking how much I enjoy being Mrs. Blackwood. Maybe I'll withdraw the divorce petition. Did you know either party can cancel proceedings before finalization?"

The color drained from both women's faces.
###Chapter 39

Vivian never imagined Cassandra, who always played the victim, would dare to stand up for herself.

"You disgusting witch!" Charlotte shrieked, her face twisted in fury. "Look at yourself—pathetic, shameless, clinging to a man who despises you! Your family's bankrupt, and you're nothing but a gold-digging leech!"

"Do you really think delaying the divorce changes anything?" Charlotte spat. "Nathaniel's child is growing inside Cassandra. Their marriage is inevitable. You have no right to refuse!"

"I won't debate my rights with you," Vivian replied calmly. "But one thing is certain—you have no say in my marriage."

"And what if she's pregnant? Until the divorce is finalized, I'm still his wife. That makes her the mistress, and her child illegitimate."

The words struck a nerve. Cassandra's lips trembled, but she forced herself to maintain her fragile facade.

"Miss Lockhart," she whispered, tears welling, "insult me all you want, but don't you dare speak about my baby like that!"

"I'm stating facts," Vivian shot back. "If a mistress's child isn't illegitimate, what is it? Royalty?"

Cassandra gasped, clutching her stomach dramatically. "Nathaniel and I love each other! That makes you the unwanted one!"

"Enough talking," Charlotte snarled. "People like her only understand one thing—force!" She raised her hand to strike.

But before the blow landed, a strong hand caught her wrist.

"Who dares—?"

Her voice died when she saw who stood behind her. "M-Mr. Osborne."

Liam looked every inch the aristocratic prince in his tailored white suit, his presence commanding and dangerous.

"Miss Whitmore," he said with a chilling smile, "did you forget your medication today? Or do you always throw tantrums in public?"

Charlotte paled. The Osbornes might rank lowest among the Elite Eight, but their underworld ties were no secret.

"You wouldn't... actually cut out someone's tongue... would you?" she stammered.

Liam's grip tightened. "Try me."

Cassandra intervened hastily. "Mr. Osborne, this is a misunderstanding! We only approached Miss Lockhart because she seemed... out of place here."

"This is my hotel," Liam said coldly. "She can walk in naked if she pleases. You, however, are one word away from being thrown out."

Vivian touched his arm. "Let's go inside."

The moment they disappeared, Charlotte exploded. "Since when is that gold-digger cozy with Liam Osborne?! She's nothing but a man-stealing parasite!"

Her boyfriend, Walter, tried to soothe her. "Forget them, baby. I've got a surprise that'll make you the star tonight."

Charlotte scoffed. "You? You're nothing compared to Liam!"

Walter only smirked. "Just wait."
###Chapter 40

Vivian Lockhart walked alongside Nathaniel Blackwood down the grand hallway leading to the ballroom.

The man who had just moments ago carried himself with icy authority now gazed at Vivian with puppy-like devotion.

"Those Hunt family bastards had no right treating you that way," he muttered, jaw clenched. "Next time they try anything, I'll make them regret it."

Vivian arched an eyebrow, lips curving. "Nathaniel Blackwood, intimidating? Who knew my playful junior could turn so fierce?"

He puffed out his chest. "I am a Blackwood, after all."

Yet despite his words, his expression remained soft as he studied Vivian's outfit. "Though honestly, Viv, that jacket doesn't exactly scream 'high society gala.'"

"It's Miss Lockhart to you," she corrected lightly. "Unless you've forgotten who's senior here?"

Nathaniel's lower lip jutted out. "Sophia gets to call you Viv. Why can't I?"

"Because," Vivian said, tapping his nose, "that would imply certain... feelings. You're not harboring any, are you?"

His gaze turned serious. "You're single now. What's stopping me?"

Years of waiting. That's what this moment was for him.

Vivian only smiled in response.

As they reached the ballroom doors, her fingers moved deftly, unbuttoning the windbreaker. With one fluid motion, she shrugged it off, shook out her hair, and slicked on crimson lipstick.

Nathaniel's breath caught.

Every head in the ballroom swiveled toward them.

Vivian stood radiant in a blood-red gown that hugged every curve, the daring cut accentuating her slender waist. She glowed like a fallen star, commanding every eye in the room.

"Is that... Mrs. Blackwood?" someone gasped.

The murmurs had just begun when Nathaniel Blackwood descended the staircase like a stormcloud, his icy glare locking onto the scarlet vision by the entrance.

Annoyance flickered behind his composed mask.

What game was she playing now?

In three strides, he had her waist in his possessive grip. "Mrs. Blackwood," he said through clenched teeth, "I was just coming to collect you."

Though his smile was perfect, the danger in his eyes made bystanders step back.

The confirmation sent shockwaves through the crowd. Men averted their gazes from Vivian's figure; silenced women swallowed their cattiness.

Without ceremony, Nathaniel hauled her into a private room.

"Care to explain?" Vivian asked calmly, tucking a loose strand behind her ear.

His gaze dropped to her décolletage. "I provided a dress. What is this?"

"Your choice looked like something my grandmother would wear."

Nathaniel saw red. That dress had been a Gi original—most socialites would kill for it.

(Though admittedly, it had been... conservative.)

Vivian tilted her head, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Or were you worried others might enjoy the view too much?"
###Chapter 41

"Your body isn't for public display."

Ethan's gaze burned into Vivian as he spoke, his voice laced with a possessiveness he didn't even recognize in himself.

"You're my wife," he reminded her sharply. "Act like it. Dressing like this is unacceptable. You're only inviting trouble."

The memory of those men ogling her made his blood boil. He'd wanted to claw their eyes out.

"Wear this." He shrugged off his jacket and draped it roughly over her shoulders.

"Since when did you become my father?" Vivian laughed, but her eyes glittered with icy disdain.

"Newsflash, Mr. Blackwood—we're not in the 1800s. My body, my rules. If I want attention, I'll take it. And it's none of your damn business."

With deliberate slowness, she slid the jacket off and let it dangle from one finger before dropping it to the floor.

"Keep your chivalry to yourself."

Chin lifted, she strode away like a queen dismissing a peasant, her curves swaying hypnotically until she vanished into the crowd.

Ethan stood frozen, jaw clenched. Rage simmered beneath his skin, but deeper still—the bitter realization that he'd lost any right to control her.

The sharp clink of a champagne glass signaled the charity gala's commencement.

Newport City's elite filled the venue. Ethan, Vivian, and Liam occupied the front row. Behind them sat Charlotte, Micah, Cassandra, and their entourage.

"See how she flaunts herself?" Charlotte hissed to Cassandra, nails digging into her clutch. "That Lockhart slut's playing both sides—Ethan on her right, Liam on her left. Disgusting."

Cassandra stifled a giggle. "Careful, someone might hear you."

"So what? It's the truth!" Charlotte's envy twisted her pretty face. "Just wait. Her little parade won't last."

A wicked plan already brewed in her mind.

The host took center stage, beaming.

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Newport City's Annual Charity Gala! Tonight's auction proceeds will fund education for underprivileged children."

Applause erupted as the first items were unveiled:

"A Domingo Otero masterpiece, donated by Charles Leavitt—valued at $200,000."

"A Hermès limited edition handbag from Lily Mauve—$300,000."

"An authentic Tibetan Dzi bead from supermodel Jakob Thibault—$500,000."

The crowd's excitement crescendoed. For Newport's elite, this auction was a battlefield—where social status was won through extravagant displays of wealth.

Ethan and Liam, already untouchable in influence, never participated in donations. Their power came from outbidding everyone else.

"And now," the host's voice dropped to a dramatic whisper, "our most extraordinary donation tonight comes from Mr. Micah Larson—a tribute to his beloved, Miss Charlotte Whitmore."

The velvet cover was whisked away.

Gasps filled the room.

"Oh my God!"
###Chapter 42

The glass exhibition case illuminated a delicate peach-shaped pendant, its rosy hue casting prismatic reflections across the room.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the auctioneer announced, "this exquisite piece was carved from a single flawless pink crystal."

He paused dramatically. "Its romantic name? The Eternal Heart."

The crowd murmured as he continued. "This isn't just any trinket. Historical records show it was commissioned for the adopted princess of Vienna's royal family."

His voice dropped to a reverent whisper. "A genuine royal artifact, valued at three million dollars."

Beside me, Ethan Blackwood scoffed. "The cut is mediocre at best," he muttered. "Only fools would pay that much for a glorified rock with a fabricated backstory."

I studied the pendant with narrowed eyes. "The crystal quality is undeniable," I said carefully. "But its royal provenance? That's... questionable."

The auctioneer beamed. "Our highest-valued donation tonight comes from Mr. Nathaniel Blackwood, gifted in Miss Isabella Lockhart's name."

Polite applause filled the room as Isabella ascended the stage, preening under the attention. She took the microphone with practiced grace.

"Thank you all," she simpered. "For this charitable occasion, I'd like to invite my dear sister-in-law, Vivian Lockhart, to join me."

Every head turned toward me. I recognized the trap instantly - Isabella's saccharine smile couldn't mask the venom in her eyes.

Still, I rose smoothly, my stiletto heels clicking against the marble as I approached the stage. Murmurs followed my path - some admiring, others judgmental.

Isabella's grip tightened on the microphone. "We're all here supporting such a worthy cause," she said pointedly. "Yet strangely, you haven't contributed anything, Vivian."

The barb landed perfectly. Disapproving whispers rippled through the crowd. I could practically see the headlines forming - "Blackwood Heiress Too Stingy for Charity."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched from his front-row seat. Dominic Harrington looked ready to storm the stage. Only Ethan remained impassive, watching me with calculating intensity.

I accepted the microphone, my voice calm. "I'll gladly make my donation shortly. But first..."

I turned to face the audience. "I must apologize on behalf of my sister-in-law."

Confused murmurs erupted. Isabella's smile faltered. "What nonsense are you spewing now?" she hissed under her breath.

Ignoring her, I continued. "Because the pendant she just donated?" My lips curved. "It's a counterfeit."
###Chapter 43

Vivian's words ignited Charlotte's fury like a match to gasoline.

"You insane jealous bitch!" Charlotte shrieked, her designer heels stomping against the stage. "My boyfriend paid millions for that pendant! How dare you call it fake? I'll make you regret opening your filthy mouth!"

The polished socialite facade shattered as Charlotte lunged at Vivian with manicured claws outstretched.

Vivian sidestepped effortlessly, sending Charlotte sprawling across the stage in a tangle of designer fabric.

The crowd erupted in laughter at the undignified spectacle.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Storm clouds gathered in his piercing gaze as he watched the scene unfold.

Vivian Lockhart. What fresh hell was she unleashing now? First the scandalous dress, now this public brawl with his cousin. The tabloids would feast on this for weeks.

"Mrs. Blackwood," the flustered host intervened, "was this just... humor? Or do you have proof of your claim?"

Vivian's crimson lips curved. "Naturally."

She produced a laser pen from her clutch with a magician's flourish. "The genuine Evesting Heart contains sixteen internal facets - one for each letter in its name. When illuminated..." She aimed the beam at the display case. "...it should project those words in light."

Murmurs spread through the crowd. Several guests nodded, recalling the legendary pendant's authentication method.

The laser revealed nothing but unrefracted light passing through the crystal.

"A counterfeit!" someone shouted.

"Pathetic," another guest sneered. "Using charity to flaunt fake wealth."

Charlotte's face burned crimson. She whirled on Micah. "You imbecile! You humiliated me with this trash?"

Micah cowered under the crowd's judgment. "I swear I paid millions! The dealer never mentioned-"

"Then how," Charlotte spat, rounding on Vivian, "would some gold-digging nobody know such obscure details?"

Vivian barely suppressed her smirk.

Of course she knew. The real pendant sat in her vault, a gift from her adoptive father - the King of Berlin himself.

"Lucky guess," Vivian lied, watching Charlotte slink offstage like a whipped dog.

In the front row, Liam exhaled. His boss always landed on her feet.

"Since my dear cousin-in-law donated a replica," Vivian announced, "allow me to offer something genuine."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. What could his estranged wife possibly contribute? Their four-year marriage had left her with little beyond the clothes on her back.

Then Vivian raised her left hand.

And began removing her massive diamond wedding ring.
###Chapter 44

"This is my wedding ring, the symbol of my union with my husband." Vivian's voice was steady, though her fingers trembled slightly as she held it up. "It may not be the most valuable piece here, but its meaning is irreplaceable. Today, I choose to donate it—hoping it will bring aid to those in need."

The announcement sent shockwaves through the crowd. Gasps and murmurs erupted.

How could she part with something so personal?

Some admired her selflessness, her ability to rise above sentimentality. Others, however, exchanged knowing glances—was this proof of the rumors about Ethan and Vivian's crumbling marriage?

Ethan sat motionless in the audience, his expression unreadable. The air around him turned icy, warning anyone from daring to approach.

Liam, on the other hand, couldn’t hide his delight. A smirk played on his lips as he leaned forward, his words sharp as knives. "Interesting. The great Vivian Lockhart, who once refused to remove that ring even for a second, now tosses it away without hesitation." His gaze flicked to Ethan. "Seems she’s finally done with you, Blackwood. Congratulations, Viv!"

With a dramatic flourish, he stood and whistled, drawing every eye in the room toward Vivian on stage.

"Don’t worry, darling," he called, voice dripping with false sincerity. "I’ll make sure that ring comes back to you—even if it costs me half the Osborne fortune."

The crowd buzzed with scandalized excitement. The poised, untouchable Mrs. Blackwood, entangled with the notorious playboy Liam Osborne?

Vivian met his gaze with quiet gratitude. Despite his theatrics, he’d given her the upper hand tonight.

"Mrs. Blackwood," the host interjected carefully, "this ring clearly holds deep significance. Are you certain about your decision?"

Vivian stared at the diamond—large, flawless, once cherished. Memories flashed: stolen glances, whispered promises, a love that had turned to dust.

She’d worn it through every moment, clinging to the illusion it represented.

Now, she saw it for what it was—a gilded chain.

"I’ve made my choice," she said firmly. "Let it go where it can truly matter."

Applause erupted. Admiration, curiosity, judgment—all blended into noise.

She could feel Ethan’s burning stare, but she didn’t look back.

Stepping offstage, she didn’t return to her seat. Instead, she slipped into the restroom, splashing cold water on her face.

The woman in the mirror was different. Stronger. Unshackled.

No more shadows of the wife who begged for scraps of affection.

She was free.

A smirk curled her lips. Ethan’s stormy expression had been priceless.

Mission accomplished.

She touched up her lipstick, ready to leave—until a low voice from the men’s room froze her in place.

"Once Blackwood takes the stage," the man muttered, "we strike. No mistakes this time."

A second voice chuckled darkly. "Last time, his brother got in the way. Tonight? Let’s see if luck saves him again."

Vivian’s breath caught.

Was Ethan walking into a trap?
###Chapter 45

Vivian could have walked away that very moment. In just twenty days, their divorce would be finalized, severing all ties between them forever.

If Ethan died tonight, she'd inherit a fortune as his legal wife. She'd be set for life beyond her wildest dreams.

Yet she couldn't bring herself to be that heartless. Despite everything, she turned back toward the auction hall.

What choice did she have? He was still the father of her children. If they ever discovered she'd abandoned him in his hour of need, they'd never forgive her.

The bidding frenzy reached its peak as she slipped back into her seat.

"Five million!"

"Six million!"

"Six point five!"

Celebrities and socialites waved their paddles with feverish excitement. The item up for auction? The very ring she'd removed from her finger moments earlier.

When Vivian sat down, the bid already stood at 6.8 million. "Absurd," she muttered. That ring had cost barely half that amount. These people had more money than sense.

She reached for her drink to steady her nerves, her fingers accidentally brushing against Ethan's. His skin felt as cold as his piercing gaze. "You've certainly made yourself the center of attention tonight," he said icily. "Who knew my wife could part with her wedding ring so easily after four years?"

Vivian took a deliberate sip before responding with a smile. "Nothing mysterious about it, Mr. Blackwood. Just putting it to better use."

Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously. If they'd been alone, she had no doubt he'd have torn her apart.

Leaning closer, she whispered, "As your soon-to-be ex-wife, I feel obliged to warn you - don't go on that stage. Someone means you harm."

She'd scanned the room earlier but spotted no obvious threats. Still, with Ethan exposed under spotlights while danger lurked in shadows, the risk was too great.

Ethan studied her with sudden intensity. "What game are you playing now?"

"No game. Just heed my warning if you value your life."

"Twelve million!"

"Twelve point five!"

"Thirteen!"

The bids climbed to ludicrous heights, nearing fifteen million. Among the bidders, Julian Montgomery stood out - waving his paddle with reckless abandon. As the favored heir to his family's fortune, money meant nothing to him.

"Thirteen point five!" Julian called out.

Silence fell. The ring's true value lay not in its diamonds, but in its history as Vivian Lockhart's wedding band.

"Going once!"

"Going twice!"

The auctioneer's voice trembled with excitement. "This is your last chance, ladies and gentlemen! A one-of-a-kind piece with immense sentimental value!"

When no counteroffer came, he raised his gavel. "Sold for thirteen point five mil-"

"Fifteen million." Ethan's emotionless voice cut through the room as he raised his paddle.

Gasps erupted.

Vivian stared in disbelief. Had he lost his mind? With their divorce imminent, why waste fifteen million on a symbol of their failed marriage?

"True love prevails!" someone cried.

"Whatever belongs to the wife should return to her!"

"Mr. Blackwood clearly adores his wife! So much for those cold marriage rumors!"

The crowd swooned over Ethan's grand gesture.

But Cassandra Delacroix, seated nearby, glared daggers at Vivian, her fists clenched in jealous rage.

The auctioneer turned to Julian. "Mr. Montgomery? Any counteroffer?"

Julian merely shrugged with an easy smile. "I'm tapped out. It's all yours."

"Fifteen million - going once!"

"Going twice!"

"Sold to Mr. Blackwood for fifteen million!" The auctioneer beamed. "Please join us on stage for a few words!"

Ethan maintained his usual cool demeanor, though privately he wondered if he'd walked into some trap set by Vivian and Julian. Or had he stepped in willingly?

Spotlights found him as he stood, adjusting his suit jacket.

"Don't go up there," Vivian hissed, grabbing his arm. On that stage, he'd be an easy target.

When he ignored her, she tightened her grip. "Fine. Then I'm coming with you."
###Chapter 46

Ethan and Vivian stepped onto the stage together. The spotlight made them look like the perfect couple.

The host began discussing their relationship while the audience cheered. Vivian's sharp eyes scanned the crowd, searching for anything unusual.

But everyone seemed normal. No suspicious figures stood out.

Was I imagining things? Or was that just a joke?

Then the host announced, "Let's congratulate Mr. Blackwood for winning the auction at fifteen million dollars! Our presenter will now hand him the ring."

A stunning woman in a white gown gracefully presented Ethan with the velvet box containing the diamond ring.

"Now, let's have Mr. Blackwood place this ring on his wife's finger once more! Everyone here wants to witness their enduring love!"

The host’s tone made it sound like a wedding ceremony.

The crowd erupted in excitement, as if they were attending an actual wedding. The energy matched their real one four years ago.

Ethan’s expression remained cold. He had just wasted fifteen million on something that was already his.

But for the sake of appearances, he played along. "Thank you all for being here to witness my love for my wife. This ring belongs on her finger."

He took the ring and reached for Vivian’s hand.

She stifled a laugh, her body stiffening with discomfort.

Is this really necessary?

She didn’t extend her hand. Instead, she forced a smile and muttered through clenched teeth, "I don’t think this is needed."

"Oh, but it is. How else will I keep you by my side?"

Ethan was effortlessly charming—and shameless.

The audience cheered louder.

Vivian had no choice. She reluctantly held out her hand. "Fine, Mr. Blackwood. Do the honors."

Let’s see who’s embarrassed now.

She could always take it off later.

Ethan took her hand and slid the ring onto her finger with practiced grace. It looked like a scene from a romantic movie.

But at that moment, Vivian noticed something strange about the presenter holding the box.

"Watch out!"

She yanked Ethan behind her just as the woman pulled a small revolver from her gown. Vivian kicked the gun away—but not fast enough.

Bang!

A bullet tore through her arm. Blood spilled from the wound.

"Ahhh! Murder!"

Chaos erupted as people screamed and ran.

"You ruined everything!"

The "presenter" snarled in a man’s voice. His murderous glare locked onto Vivian as he pulled out another gun.

"Ethan Blackwood, today is the end of your family!"

At the same time, three other hosts lunged at them.

"Go! They’re after you!" Vivian shielded Ethan, her voice icy.

"You’re hurt!" He didn’t move, his gaze fixed on the blood pouring from her arm.

The sight reminded him of Sebastian’s fatal wound three months ago.

Nausea hit him. His vision blurred, and he collapsed.

More gunshots rang out. Through the haze, he saw Vivian get hit again.

"Vivian!"

He tried to stand, but darkness swallowed him.
###Chapter 47

Ethan Blackwood woke with a start, his vision blurry as he took in the sterile white walls of the hospital room. A nurse hurried in, her eyes widening when she saw him conscious.

"Mr. Blackwood! You're finally awake. You've been out for a full day."

"A full day?"

Damn it.

His hemophobia was getting worse. He couldn’t afford to black out at crucial moments. The last thing he remembered before passing out was Vivian Lockhart getting shot. His chest tightened at the memory.

He grabbed the nurse’s wrist, his voice sharp. "How’s Vivian? Is she alright?"

The nurse flinched at his sudden intensity. "Mrs. Lockhart? She only needed minor treatment. She left after bringing you here yesterday."

"Minor treatment?"

Relief washed over him.

Her injuries weren’t as severe as he’d feared.

"Yes. After she was patched up, she left with Mr. Osborne," the nurse added.

"She left with Liam?" Ethan’s jaw clenched. He immediately demanded to be discharged.

Ding dong!

Vivian had just poured hot water into her instant noodles when the doorbell rang.

She frowned. Liam is relentless. I just sent him away—it’s just a scratch, not a life-threatening wound. Can’t I have some peace?

She yanked the door open—and froze.

Ethan stood there, his expression unreadable.

"W-why are you here?"

Shouldn’t he still be in the hospital? I heard his blood phobia is serious.

"Are you alone?"

Instead of answering, he countered with his own question. His sharp gaze swept past her, scanning the apartment like he was searching for an intruder.

"That’s none of your business."

"Of course it is. Even if we’re not married anymore, we’re still neighbors. Can’t I check on you?"

Before she could protest, he pushed past her and stepped inside.

Vivian was speechless. Since when had he become so shameless?

When I was his wife, he never cared. Now he’s suddenly concerned because we’re neighbors?

Ethan prowled through her apartment, inspecting every corner. Only when he confirmed she was alone did his expression soften slightly.

"You’re eating this for dinner?"

He eyed the instant noodles with clear disapproval.

"My hand’s injured. I can’t cook, and takeout isn’t clean."

Her imported noodles were high-quality, packed with nutrients.

"You’re ridiculous."

Despite his complaint, he strode to the kitchen and rummaged through her fridge. Though ingredients were scarce, he managed to whip up three dishes and a soup.

"I didn’t know you could cook."

Vivian stared at the spread, reassessing the cold, aristocratic man in front of her.

"There’s a lot you don’t know about me," he said, placing the food in front of her.

The bullet had grazed her right hand, leaving her struggling to hold a spoon with her left. Noticing this, Ethan took the spoon from her and lifted a bite to her lips.

This… is too intimate.

Her cheeks warmed.

"Open your mouth," he ordered.

She had no choice but to comply. The food was surprisingly delicious.

"Women are so troublesome," he muttered.

But his movements were gentle.

They ate in silence, an unspoken understanding between them.

As Vivian chewed, tears pricked her eyes. She had dreamed of this moment countless times during their marriage. She hadn’t asked for his love—just his company at the dinner table.

Yet for four years, she had eaten alone.

Her marriage had been unbearably lonely.

The table had been empty. The bed had been empty. Even her heart had been empty.

Now that he wanted to stay, she no longer needed him.

Solitude suited her just fine.

"I’m full. Thanks for the meal. You can go home now, neighbor."

She wiped her tears and steeled herself, trying to shoo him away.

But Ethan didn’t move. He set the spoon down deliberately.

"I’m staying until you recover."

"That’s unnecessary."

"What you think doesn’t matter."

Before she could argue, he scooped her into his arms.

"Now, I’m giving you a bath and putting you to bed."

What the hell is he planning?

Her pulse spiked.
###Chapter 48

"Ethan, put me down. We're not that close!" Vivian struggled against his hold, her cheeks burning with humiliation.

Despite her skills and reputation, she couldn't break free from him.

"Stop squirming. You're injured." His voice was firm as he carried her into the bathroom, his expression unreadable.

She was light in his arms, stirring an unexpected protectiveness in him.

Vivian scoffed. It was just a minor cut on her arm—not a broken leg. But when he set her down in the bathtub without leaving, panic flared.

"Ethan, you're not seriously planning to bathe me, are you? Don't even think about taking advantage!"

A slow smirk curved his lips as he leaned in, his finger tilting her chin up. "What if I want to? This tub is big enough for two."

"No!" Her face flushed crimson.

She never imagined the cold, composed man she once admired had such a wicked side. The most proper ones were always the most dangerous.

"Touch me, and I'm calling the police."

"Go ahead. Let's see what they say about a married couple sharing a bath."

With that, he turned on the faucet, then casually undid two buttons of his shirt, revealing sculpted abs.

His voice dropped to a husky whisper as he leaned closer. "Since the divorce is coming, why not make this our farewell?"

He was openly seducing her.

Vivian clenched her fists. If the police won't help, I'll handle this myself.

Even injured, she could still take him down.

The water rose steadily, the air thickening with tension. Just as she prepared to strike, he suddenly stood, looking down at her with amusement.

"You're so gullible."

He flicked water at her face. "I'm not desperate enough to pounce on an injured woman. Call if you need me."

Then he walked out, shutting the door softly behind him.

Vivian exhaled. Had she really misread him?

Ethan had never shown interest in her before. In four years of marriage, they'd only been intimate once—and that was because they were both drunk.

You're overthinking, she told herself.

Steam filled the bathroom as she sank into the warm water, closing her eyes to the soft hum of music.

Outside, Ethan lounged on the sofa, newspaper in hand, every inch the refined aristocrat.

The charity gala dominated the front page—with him and Vivian as the centerpiece.

The four attackers had been caught, including a man disguised as a woman. Over the years, the Blackwood family had made enemies, and as the sole heir, Ethan was a prime target.

He remembered Vivian's warning before he took the stage.

Did she know something?

But no—she was just an innocent woman caught in this mess.

He planned to question her later, but his phone rang.

"Mr. Blackwood," Ethan Young's voice was grave. "The police confirmed it—the same people behind the Newrest attack three months ago hired these men."

Ethan's grip tightened.

That attack was no accident. If it was planned... then Sebastian's death wasn't random. It was murder.

"They won't name who's behind it. If you're well enough, I suggest attending the hearing—"

BANG!

A loud crash came from the bathroom.
###Chapter 49

"What's going on?" Ethan's voice cut through the air as he ended the call and rushed toward the bathroom door.

His hand hovered over the knob when Vivian's panicked shout stopped him. "I'm fine! Don't you dare come in!"

A loud crash echoed from behind the door.

That didn't sound fine at all.

After a brief hesitation, he pushed the door open.

"Ah! Who said you could enter? Get out!" Vivian stood frozen in the bathtub, hastily wrapping a towel around herself. Though she moved quickly, he'd already caught a glimpse of her bare skin.

Ethan's breath hitched. His throat went dry as his gaze lingered.

How had he never noticed how breathtaking she was?

Four years living together, and he'd been blind to this treasure right under his nose.

When his brain finally rebooted, he noticed the fallen clothes rack. Her garments and dry towel lay soaked in the tub, leaving her with only a dripping wet towel for coverage.

"Need assistance?" His voice came out surprisingly steady.

She looked utterly tantalizing, water droplets glistening on her exposed shoulders.

"What do you think?" Vivian's cheeks burned crimson.

'Has this man no shame? Barging in when I'm naked! If not for this towel, I'd dig a hole and disappear right now!' Her thoughts screamed embarrassment.

"You seem to be in quite the predicament. How may I assist?" Ethan stepped closer, concern etching his features.

"St-stay back! That's the best help you can give!" She stumbled backward in her flustered retreat, not noticing the tub's edge until it was too late.

"Careful!" Ethan lunged forward.

His arms encircled her waist just as she tipped backward. They crashed into the water together, bodies pressed flush in the shallow tub.

Skin met skin through thin, wet fabric. Heartbeats pounded in sync.

Ethan found himself staring down at Vivian, really seeing her for the first time.

Her eyes held galaxies - soft yet mysterious. Rosy blooms colored her porcelain cheeks, captivating him completely.

"Planning to stay like this forever? My legs are going numb." Her arms had instinctively wound around his neck.

The spell broke. Ethan schooled his expression into neutrality as he carefully extracted them from the tub. Turning his back like a proper gentleman, he stated, "I'll fetch your clothes."

"But I can—"

He was already gone.

Vivian sighed, surrendering to the absurdity. They'd been intimate before, for heaven's sake. She was carrying his twins. Modesty seemed rather pointless now.

Wrapping the damp towel tighter, she perched on the tub's edge to wait.

In the bedroom, Ethan located her nightgown easily enough. Then a small jewelry box caught his eye.

The automatic lid revealed modest pieces - except one. A peach-shaped crystal pendant identical to the one auctioned at last month's charity gala.

'The real deal? But this was custom-made for the Princess of Berlin...' His mind raced.

Just how many secrets did his seemingly docile wife harbor?

His phone buzzed. Ethan Young again.

"Did they talk? Who's behind this?" Ethan's calm tone barely concealed his urgency.

"No." A heavy sigh traveled through the line. "Police just reported they're dead. Suicide."

"Damn it!" Ethan's fist clenched. Another dead end when he'd been so close!

"Keep digging. I want Tristan's killer found." His voice turned glacial. Then, after a beat: "Compile a dossier on Vivian. Everything. Classified or not."

"Wait... Mrs. Blackwood's records?" Ethan Young sounded genuinely perplexed.

'Four years married, and only now he wants her background check? What's gotten into him?' The secretary wondered silently.
###Chapter 50

The clock struck midnight when Ethan and Vivian finally changed into their sleepwear.

Vivian lay on the bed, arms crossed, glaring at the striking man lounging on the sofa in dark blue pajamas.

"It's just a scratch on my arm. You don’t need to babysit me all night," she snapped. "Go home. We should stick to our usual arrangement—distance."

Ethan calmly closed the magazine he'd been flipping through. His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "You got hurt protecting me. That makes it my responsibility." He tilted his head slightly. "Need me to tuck you in?"

"Absolutely not!" Vivian huffed, rolling onto her side, turning her back to him.

Fine. If he insisted on playing bodyguard, she wouldn’t stop him. At least she was comfortably sprawled across the bed while he suffered on that stiff sofa.

The soft glow of the bedside lamp cast warm shadows across the room. Silence stretched between them, broken only by the occasional rustle of magazine pages.

Oddly enough, despite her recent insomnia, sleep came easily tonight. For the first time in days, she felt safe.

Ethan rubbed his temples, exhaustion creeping in. The golden light accentuated his sharp jawline and tousled dark hair.

His gaze drifted to Vivian, curled into a tiny ball under the covers. Something in his chest tightened. How could someone so delicate possess such reckless bravery?

He stayed because he knew the dangers lurking in the shadows. If she woke thirsty or in pain, he’d be there. And if those who’d tried to kill him came for revenge—he’d be ready.

Coffee in hand, he scrolled through his phone, pausing on a trending fan page—Lockhart_Hunter.

The page had exploded after the auction incident. Countless posts praised Vivian’s heroics. He clicked on a viral video—her lightning-fast kick disarming the gunman.

His brows furrowed.

Those moves weren’t amateur. They were polished, precise—like years of training.

Who is this woman?

The comments section was worse.

"Vivian is a goddess! Risking her life for love? Iconic."

"Ethan doesn’t deserve her. Liam Osborne would treat her better."

"Team #Lockwood_Osborne forever!"

His grip tightened around the phone.

Creating a burner account, he fired back: "Liam’s a spoiled playboy. He’s nowhere near her league."

The internet pounced.

"Says who? Prove it, troll."

"Liam’s loyal. Ethan’s just cold."

"Get a life, hater."

Gritting his teeth, he deleted the comment.

Worse yet, posts glorifying Vivian and Liam flooded the page. Then he remembered—the fanfiction.

Lockhart_Hunter had written a viral story about them. But it was gone. Vanished.

Frustrated, he dialed Ethan Young.

"Can you recover deleted posts during damage control?"

"...What?"

"An account named Lockhart_Hunter wrote a fic about Vivian and me. Get tech to retrieve it."

Ten minutes later, the reply came.

"Mr. Blackwood, the techs checked. We didn’t delete it. The author wiped all traces deliberately."

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

Now he needed to read it.
###Chapter 51

The morning light streamed through the curtains as Nathaniel Blackwood forwarded Vivian Lockhart's complete dossier to Ethan Young.

Ethan's fingers trembled slightly as he scrolled through the documents. His breath caught when he realized who his wife truly was.

Four years of marriage. Four years of ignorance. The woman he'd dismissed as quiet and unremarkable had been Stanford University's prodigy.

Vivian had skipped two grades in high school. Gained direct admission to Stanford's prestigious Electrical Engineering program. Specialized in Electromagnetic Fields and Wave Propagation.

By sophomore year, she'd become a teaching assistant. Her lectures drew standing-room-only crowds. During her master's program, she'd studied abroad in Berlin, maintaining perfect grades.

Then came the fall of the Lockhart dynasty.

The Elite Eight's golden child watched her parents jump from their penthouse when Lockhart Enterprises collapsed. Enemies emerged from every shadow.

Arthur Lockhart took in his orphaned granddaughter. That's when Alfred Blackwood had forced Ethan home to marry her.

He remembered their first meeting in the rain. Vivian in white, a single gardenia tucked behind her ear. Silent. Solemn. Everything he despised in a woman.

For four years, he'd ignored his wife. Played the doting husband at corporate functions. Returned to ignoring her afterward.

Yet she'd never faltered in her duties as Mrs. Blackwood. Cared for his grandparents with unwavering devotion. Maintained impeccable conduct despite his neglect.

If not for Cassandra Delacroix, he might have continued this charade indefinitely.

Vivian awoke to sunlight warming her face. For the first time in four years, she'd slept through the night undisturbed.

The empty space beside her brought immediate relief. "Finally gone," she murmured.

Her hope shattered when she entered the living room. Nathaniel sat on the sofa, newspaper in hand.

"Aren't you needed at Blackwood Group?" Her voice dripped with disdain as she crossed her arms.

He set the paper aside. "Breakfast is ready."

The dining table overflowed with dishes - her favorite almond croissants, fresh berries, perfectly poached eggs.

Her stomach twisted. Once, this gesture would have thrilled her. Now it tasted like bitter irony.

"Don't bother, Nathaniel." She met his gaze coolly. "Our marriage was transactional. Our divorce is imminent. Cassandra would appreciate this more than I do."

She took a steadying breath. "Respect boundaries. We're almost strangers now. Let's keep it that way."

The words hung between them, sharp as broken glass.

Nathaniel rose slowly. The air thickened as he closed the distance between them. Even in silence, his presence overwhelmed her.

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Tell me, Isabella... what exactly are you misunderstanding?"
###Chapter 52

Vivian instinctively pressed her lips together but remained silent. 'You know exactly what I misunderstood. Stop playing dumb,' she thought bitterly.

Ethan's piercing gaze locked onto her. "Whatever you assumed about me doesn't matter," he stated coldly. "But I won't tolerate your overthinking. Everything I've done is merely repayment for saving my life. Nothing more."

A self-deprecating laugh escaped her lips.

How foolish she'd been to read into his actions.

He'd never cared for her in four years of marriage. Why would that change now?

"Good." She forced a casual shrug. "Once the divorce is finalized, we won't have to see each other again anyway."

Ethan's jaw tightened. Though he'd been thinking the same thing, hearing her say it aloud left an odd emptiness in his chest.

Rolling up her sleeve, Vivian pointed to the healing wound. "See? I'm recovering just fine. You can go now."

His eyes flickered to the scar. "Where's the ointment? I'll apply it."

"No need. I can manage."

Ignoring her protest, Ethan located the medical supplies. The injury appeared deeper than he'd imagined. His fingers stilled momentarily, imagining how much pain she must have endured.

"Ouch! That hurts!" Vivian winced.

"Endure it." His touch unexpectedly gentled as he blew softly on the wound. "If you're this sensitive to pain, you shouldn't play the hero."

"Excuse me? I got hurt saving you!"

Her fingers curled into fists, itching to punch that arrogant face.

"Don't be reckless like this again." His voice turned gravelly. "I'm not worth the risk."

The weight of unspoken debts always sat heavy on his shoulders.

His phone buzzed against the coffee table. Vivian's eyes caught the caller ID - Cassandra Delacroix.

"Aren't you going to answer that?" she prompted.

After a brief hesitation, Ethan set down the ointment and picked up.

"Nathaniel? Could you come to the hospital? They need the father's signature for the prenatal checkup." Cassandra's sugary voice carried clearly despite the low volume.

"I'll be right there."

His immediate response spoke volumes.

Vivian's hand drifted unconsciously to her own stomach. Unlike Cassandra's child, her twins would never know their father's affection.

The realization stung.

Ethan hesitated, eyeing the half-treated wound.

"Go. She's waiting." Vivian forced a careless smile. "It's just a scratch, not a disability. Besides," she added with biting sarcasm, "wouldn't want to upset the mother of your child by being caught with your soon-to-be ex-wife."

His expression darkened. That unborn child represented Sebastian's legacy - too precious to risk.

"Call if you need anything." Snatching his jacket, he strode out without looking back.

The apartment plunged into icy silence once more.

Vivian stood frozen for several heartbeats before laughing hollowly at herself.

'Total defeat,' she acknowledged.

Shaking it off, she welcomed the solitude. Finally, she could enjoy her books and yoga in peace.

The doorbell shattered her brief tranquility.

"Did he forget something?"

Heart inexplicably racing, she swung the door open - only to freeze at the completely unexpected visitor standing there.
###Chapter 53

"You?"

Shock flashed across Vivian's face.

An unexpected visitor stood before her.

"Am I not welcome?" Julian asked, hands casually tucked in his pockets. The shadow of his cap cast a mysterious aura over his striking features.

Vivian crossed her arms. "We're hardly acquainted."

A hacker like him showing up unannounced set her instincts on high alert.

"Hardly acquainted?" Julian chuckled darkly. "We've been partners in the digital world for years. Never met face-to-face, but we've collaborated countless times. Doesn't that make us old friends, Scarlet?"

Vivian exhaled sharply. So he had known her identity all along—that’s why he let her win at Blackwood Group.

Fine. She’d wanted to meet him anyway.

"Scarlet Phoenix," she said, extending a hand. "But you can call me Vivian."

His fingers closed around hers. "Julian Blackthorn. Though most know me as Haze."

A long-awaited moment.

Ever since Scarlet narrowly defeated him in their first hacker competition, he’d been obsessed with finding her. He’d imagined some grizzled old man—not this stunning woman betrayed by her own husband.

"Blackthorn?"

Not a common surname. Vivian’s eyes narrowed. "Any relation to Frederick Baldwin of Edinburgh?"

"My grandfather." He shrugged, as if admitting he owned a candy store.

Vivian’s jaw nearly hit the floor. "You’re telling me the man who commands an army capable of leveling cities is your grandfather?"

Childhood stories rushed back—Arthur Lockhart’s wartime alliances, the infamous fallout between the Lockharts and Baldwins.

"Funny, isn’t it?" Julian’s gaze turned wistful. "If I’d known the woman my grandfather tried to force me to marry was the legendary Scarlet, I’d have said yes in a heartbeat."

He leaned in. "I’d have treated you like a queen. No cheating. No lies."

Years ago, when the Lockharts faced ruin and Vivian was left alone, Frederick had pushed for their marriage. Julian vanished—not to escape, but to hunt down Scarlet.

And all along, she’d been right there.

"Fate’s a cruel joker," he groaned, collapsing onto her couch.

Vivian tossed him a juice bottle. "Why are you really here? Surely not just to lament missed chances."

Oddly, she felt at ease with him—like reuniting with a long-lost sibling. Would her life have been happier with Julian instead of Nathaniel?

"Hardly." He drained the juice in one gulp and stood. "Do you hate him? Want revenge?"

"I don’t."

Truth. She just wanted her children, her freedom, and to never see Nathaniel again.

Julian shook his head. "The Blackwoods are vulnerable now. Help me, and I’ll make the Lockharts the most powerful family in Newport City."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I expose Scarlet Phoenix." His smile chilled her. "Imagine what Nathaniel would do."

Vivian’s blood ran cold. "That’s blackmail."

He slid a card across the table. "Three days to decide. Call me when you’re ready."
###Chapter 54

Vivian tossed Julian's business card into the nearest trash bin without a second thought. His threats meant nothing to her. She'd saved Ethan's life, after all. Surely he wouldn't turn on her over some harmless deception.

Still, Julian's mention of the Blackwood family's troubles nagged at her.

Who would dare target the Blackwoods of Newport City so openly?

For a moment, she considered asking Liam to investigate. But then she remembered—she and Ethan were getting divorced soon. Why bother?

She pushed the thought aside. The Blackwoods had never appreciated her sacrifices these past four years. It was time to focus on herself.

The afternoon sun beckoned, perfect for some retail therapy. She dialed Sophia.

"Meet me at The Grand Plaza at three," Vivian said.

As she waited, her hand drifted to her stomach. The twins would arrive in two months. What had once felt like a burden now filled her with quiet anticipation.

"Viv!" Sophia's voice cut through the crowd.

The Osborne heiress looked every inch the socialite in her designer ensemble, yet she bounded toward Vivian like an overexcited puppy. Theodore Osborne's pampered daughter only showed this side to Vivian—hence her nickname "the golden airhead."

"You finally called!" Sophia crushed her in a hug before inspecting her healing injuries. "Liam's been hogging you like some possessive guard dog. As if he stands a chance against our bond!" She punctuated this with dramatic cheek kisses.

Vivian laughed, swatting her away. "Enough. Let's shop."

"Chanel or Prada? Ugh, this mall doesn't even have Hermès. Tragic." Sophia wrinkled her nose at the plebeian surroundings.

"Window shopping first."

Yet Vivian found herself steering them straight to the fourth-floor baby boutiques. Tiny outfits lined the displays, each more adorable than the last.

"This romper! And these booties!" Vivian's fingers traced the impossibly small garments, her voice rising with excitement. "Sophia, look at this lace dress!"

Sophia gaped from the doorway. Since when did Vivian—who once compared children to noisy gremlins—squeal over baby clothes?

Something was definitely up.

Vivian drifted deeper into the store, drawn to a porcelain doll on display. Her hand had just grazed its curls when—

"Ms. Lockhart?"

Cassandra Delacroix stood there, the doll now clutched in her manicured hands. Behind her, Eleanor Whitmore's eyes narrowed.

"Stalking us now, Vivian?" Ethan's mother sneered.

Cassandra cradled her visible baby bump. "Are you... expecting too?" Her sweet tone dripped venom as she deliberately brushed her swollen abdomen against Vivian's arm.
###Chapter 55

Margaret let out a derisive laugh as she looked Vivian up and down. "Nathaniel wouldn't even lay a finger on you. How could you possibly be pregnant? You're just draining our family's resources."

The venom in Margaret's words made Vivian's fists clench instinctively. She was about to retaliate when Sophia stepped forward, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

"Funny coming from you. One son dead, the other cheating. If I were you, I'd be questioning my parenting skills. Aren't you worried karma will bite your grandchildren for your poisonous tongue?"

Before the divorce, Sophia had stayed out of their family drama. But now that Vivian was leaving, she wasn't holding back.

Margaret's face turned ashen with rage. She pointed a shaking finger at Sophia. "You—"

Seeing an opportunity to curry favor, Cassandra quickly inserted herself between them. "Miss Osborne, you shouldn't speak to your elders like that. Even if you're upset, there's no need for such disrespect."

Sophia saw red.

She'd tried to stay civil, but enough was enough. Her hand flew out, connecting with Cassandra's cheek in a sharp crack.

The sound echoed through the room, leaving both Cassandra and Margaret stunned. Margaret never expected meek Vivian to have such a fiery friend.

She turned to Vivian, demanding, "Are you just going to stand there? Make your friend apologize immediately, or there will be consequences!"

Vivian remained calm. "You're the one who should apologize. I'm more concerned about my friend's hand—that face must be painfully thick from all the shamelessness."

"What?!" Margaret shrieked.

Realizing Vivian wouldn't comply, Margaret decided to take action herself. Her hand shot up to strike Sophia, but Vivian intercepted it mid-air.

"Miss Whitmore," Vivian said coldly, "sneak attacks are beneath you."

Margaret froze at the icy glint in Vivian's eyes—so different from the docile woman she'd known.

Suddenly, Cassandra collapsed dramatically onto the floor, clutching her stomach. "Oh! The pain!"

"What's going on here?" Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the tension as he entered, his handsome features dark with displeasure.

Margaret immediately became emboldened. "Nathaniel! Thank goodness you're here. These two were about to assault us! You need to teach them a lesson!"

Ignoring his mother, Nathaniel rushed to Cassandra's side. "Are you hurt? Should I call a doctor?"

Cassandra, who'd been faking, quickly demurred. "I'm fine... just a slap. It didn't affect the baby. I just need to rest."

Seeing the red mark on her face, Nathaniel's expression turned glacial.

His piercing gaze locked onto Vivian. "Care to explain yourself?" The steel in his voice could cut glass.
###Chapter 56

Vivian met Ethan's icy glare with equal composure.

"She was slapped. End of story."

It didn't matter if he thought her unreasonable or disgraceful. There was nothing to explain.

The Blackwoods meant nothing to her the moment she decided to divorce Ethan.

And honestly? It was just his mistress and his shrew of a mother.

Margaret trembled with outrage. "See? She admitted it! What are you waiting for, Ethan? Make her kneel and beg for forgiveness!"

Sophia, who had been silently observing, finally snapped. "Fuck your forgiveness! I wouldn’t have hit her if your mother and this homewrecker hadn’t called Viv a parasite and barren!"

Ethan’s brows furrowed sharply. He turned to Margaret and Cassandra. "Is that true?"

Cassandra choked on her words, guilt flashing across her face.

Margaret, however, lifted her chin defiantly. "It’s the truth! She can’t conceive. If she’s ashamed of it, that’s her problem!"

Sophia looked ready to explode. "Why the hell do you think Viv is infertile?" She yanked Vivian forward. "Let me spell it out for you. Viv is pregnant. Almost a month along. And guess what? Twins!"

Her words detonated like a bomb.

Silence.

Vivian was the most stunned of all.

What the hell? I never told Sophia about the pregnancy. How does she know?

Margaret’s gaze dropped to Vivian’s stomach, her expression twisting. "Ethan, you said you didn’t love her. So how—?"

Ethan’s lips pressed into a thin line. His cold eyes locked onto Vivian’s abdomen, his expression darkening.

They hadn’t slept together. How could she be pregnant?

Sophia smirked, relishing their shock. "Don’t flatter yourselves. Who said the babies are Ethan’s? Since he cheated, it’s only fair Viv returned the favor!"

Vivian caught on immediately. Sophia was bluffing—spectacularly.

Ethan’s voice was dangerously low. "Whose are they?"

"Fraternal twins. Obviously, they’re Liam’s!" Sophia declared triumphantly. "The Osbornes have a strong genetic history of twins, you know."

Vivian bit her lip to keep from laughing.

God, Sophia’s full of it. If I actually have twins, I’ll never live this down.

Ethan’s gaze could have flayed her alive. "Is this true?"

Vivian hesitated.

"Of course it is!" Sophia cut in, giving Ethan a pitying look. "At least Viv knows who fathered her children. Can you say the same about this one?" She jerked her chin at Cassandra.

Vivian coughed, signaling Sophia to stop before she pushed Ethan too far.

"Let’s go, Soph. Mr. Blackwood has baby clothes to pick out."

With that, she hooked her arm through Sophia’s and strode off, ignoring the lethal glare burning into her back.

Ethan watched her leave, his expression unreadable.

Margaret huffed. "I knew that woman was trouble. Good riddance!"

Ethan’s voice was steel. "Impossible."

"What?"

"She wouldn’t dare cheat. And she definitely wouldn’t get pregnant." His eyes sharpened. "She knows the consequences."

Cassandra’s nails dug into her palms. Even now, he defended Vivian?

A dark idea took root in her mind.

I’ll make sure she’s gone for good.
###Chapter 57

The encounter with Ethan and those two venomous women had drained Vivian's desire to shop. She left the mall immediately and headed straight home.

The next morning, she rose early. Dressed in a sleek black dress, her hair tied back, she stopped by a florist for a bouquet of daisies before driving to the cemetery.

March third. The anniversary of her parents' deaths.

Four years had passed since their suicide. She hadn’t visited them once. People called her heartless, ungrateful—a traitor who abandoned her family to please the Blackwoods.

But no one knew how much she loved them.

She was furious. Furious at their cowardice, their stubborn refusal to keep living, their choice to leave her alone in this world.

For years, she couldn’t bring herself to face their graves. But now, everything was different. The two tiny lives growing inside her had given her the strength to confront the past.

This might be her last visit before leaving Newport City. She didn’t know when—or if—she’d ever return.

Yet when she reached the grave, she froze.

A lavish bouquet lay before the headstone, its petals still fresh, its arrangement exquisitely crafted.

No one had visited her family in years. After the tragedy, relatives had distanced themselves, afraid of being dragged into the scandal.

So who left these flowers?

Puzzled, Vivian paid her respects and turned to leave—until something glinting beside the bouquet caught her eye.

An amber pendant.

She picked it up carefully, studying the intricate carvings inside. It felt familiar, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t recall where she’d seen it before.

Tucking it into her pocket, she decided to return it to its owner someday.

As she walked back to her car, she didn’t notice the man creeping up behind her.

Just as she opened the door, he lunged forward, arms spread wide.

Walter Reynolds.

"Darling niece!" he exclaimed, beaming. "I’ve finally found you! I’ve missed you so much!"

A reunion after four years should have been touching. But Vivian’s expression turned icy.

"Walter, I haven’t forgotten how you turned your back on us when we needed you most. Stop pretending."

He flinched, avoiding her gaze. "You have to understand, Vivian. Your aunt and I had no choice—we were just trying to survive! Deep down, I still care about you and your mother—"

She cut him off. "Spare me the act. What do you want?"

His eyes gleamed with greed as he rubbed his hands together. "I heard you’re divorcing Nathaniel. The Blackwoods are filthy rich—you must have gotten a hefty settlement, right? How about helping your dear uncle out?"

Amused, Vivian decided to humor him. "What kind of help?"

"Just a small loan. A few million, nothing major! I’m in desperate need!"

She smirked. "I didn’t get a cent from the Blackwoods. Just a law firm."

His face twisted in disbelief. "What? That stingy bastard gave you nothing but a worthless firm?"

"Not a dime."

Then she remembered. "Did you leave those flowers on my parents’ grave?"

He hesitated before forcing a smile. "Of course! Your mother loved flowers. As her brother, it was the least I could do."

Vivian almost laughed. There was no way her cheap uncle had bought those expensive flowers—or dropped that pendant.

Still, he was her mother’s brother. She wouldn’t be cruel.

"If you’re really struggling, I can get you a job once the firm’s under my control."

Without waiting for a response, she rolled up her window and sped off, leaving Walter coughing in the exhaust fumes.

"Ungrateful brat!" he shouted after her. "Who do you think you are?"

But as her car disappeared, his expression darkened.

The Blackwoods wouldn’t let her walk away empty-handed… would they?

Rubbing his chin, a plan began to form in his mind.
###Chapter 58

Vivian stepped back into her apartment after leaving the cemetery. The moment she crossed the threshold, her phone buzzed with an unfamiliar number.

It was Cassandra.

But her tone was uncharacteristically sweet and polite, nothing like the sharp condescension she usually reserved for Vivian.

"I apologize for bothering you, Miss Lockhart. While organizing the guest room, I came across some of your personal items. Would you have time to collect them this evening?"

Vivian's fingers tightened around her phone. Since when did Cassandra sound so accommodating?

What game was she playing now?

Still, Vivian kept her voice steady. "Of course. I'll be there shortly."

She had left in such a rush that she'd forgotten several important belongings. Even without Cassandra's call, she would've eventually returned to the Blackwood estate to retrieve them.

By eight that evening, Vivian hailed a cab and headed straight for the Blackwood villa. The staff barely acknowledged her presence—no greetings, no polite nods. Just cold indifference.

Typical.

Vivian ignored them and strode through the grand entrance. The house remained unchanged from her last day there. The same gilded furniture, the same sweeping staircase. Only the people inside had become strangers.

A bitter taste filled her mouth. Four wasted years in this gilded cage.

The parlor buzzed with laughter. Cassandra held court like the new queen of the manor, flanked by Charlotte and her latest fling, Micah.

The moment Vivian appeared, Cassandra transformed into the perfect hostess. "Miss Lockhart! We were just talking about you!"

Vivian didn't smile. "Where are my things?"

She had no intention of lingering.

"Upstairs in your old room. Everything's packed and ready."

"Good."

As Vivian turned toward the staircase, Cassandra caught her arm. "Stay for dinner. The chef prepared your favorite."

Vivian's gaze sharpened. "Since when are we on dinner terms, Miss Delacroix?"

The intensity in her stare made Cassandra flinch.

Charlotte sauntered over with a sneer. "Scared of a meal? No wonder Nathaniel dumped you."

Amusement flickered across Vivian's face. What an interesting duo—one playing nice, the other nasty. What were they plotting?

"Fine. I could eat."

She'd play along. Let them show their hand.

The dining table groaned under silver platters and crystal stemware. A bottle of vintage Lafite stood at the center.

Vivian accepted the wine Cassandra poured. Within minutes, heat flooded her cheeks. Her vision blurred. The room swayed.

"So dizzy... Why is it so hot...?"

Cassandra and Charlotte exchanged triumphant glances.

Charlotte nudged Micah. "She's done. Take her upstairs to get her things."

Micah's throat worked as he eyed Vivian's flushed skin. "Don't worry. I'll take care of her."

"Tonight's your reckoning, bitch," Charlotte hissed. "That drug would turn a nun into a whore. No escaping this time."

Her eyes glittered as she grabbed Cassandra's wrist. "Call Nathaniel. Let's show him what kind of slut she really is."
###Chapter 59

Cassandra feigned concern, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "Isn't this going too far? She's still your cousin's wife, after all."

Charlotte tightened her grip on Cassandra's arm, her eyes gleaming with vindictive excitement. "Cass, you're too soft-hearted. Remember how she humiliated you at the charity gala? Don't you want revenge? Did you see how she was flirting earlier? I'm being generous—I even let her borrow my boyfriend! She should be thanking me. Relax, if anything goes wrong, I'll take the blame. It won't fall on you!"

"You're such a good friend, Charlotte!"

Though Cassandra's expression was one of gratitude, she was laughing inside at Charlotte's stupidity. The girl had no idea she was being manipulated, yet she was still eagerly doing Cassandra's dirty work.

Moments later, Nathaniel returned to the villa. His tall frame radiated icy fury as he scanned the empty living room. "Where is she?"

His jaw clenched when he didn't spot Isabella.

Cassandra approached him with wide, innocent eyes. "Nathaniel, Miss Lockhart is... well, she's with Micah—"

Charlotte cut in, her voice trembling with fake distress. "Nathaniel, your so-called virtuous wife seduced my boyfriend the second we left! She dragged him straight to her bedroom!"

Without another word, she grabbed Nathaniel's arm and pulled him upstairs. His expression darkened, his lips pressed into a thin line.

When they reached Isabella's old bedroom, the door was shut tight—and unmistakable sounds of passion echoed from inside.

Cassandra tried the handle. "It's locked. I can't open it—"

Nathaniel's control snapped. "Move."

With a single powerful kick, the door burst open—revealing a scene that froze them all in shock.

Micah lay sprawled on the floor, his glazed eyes locked on a life-sized teddy bear as he murmured, "Hey, gorgeous..."

Meanwhile, Isabella lounged on the couch, legs crossed, casually filming the spectacle with one hand while munching popcorn with the other. There was no trace of the drunken act she'd put on earlier.

She grinned at the newcomers. "Perfect timing! Come watch the show—it's getting good!"

Charlotte's face twisted in horror. "What the hell is this?!"

Cassandra's stomach dropped. This wasn't part of the plan. Isabella was supposed to be disgraced, not in control.

With a shriek, Charlotte lunged at Isabella, clawing for the phone. "What did you do to him, you witch?!"

Isabella sidestepped effortlessly, sending Charlotte crashing to the floor in a heap.

"Shouldn't you know exactly why he's like this?" Isabella's voice was laced with mocking amusement as she looked down at Charlotte like she was nothing more than an insect.

Pathetic. I expected better.

She'd known the wine was drugged the second it touched her lips. Switching glasses with Micah had been child's play. Playing along with their little scheme? Just for fun.

"Charlotte, baby... come here..." Micah slurred, abandoning the teddy to grope at Charlotte instead.

The scene descended into chaos.

Isabella raised her phone, grinning. "This is gold." With this footage, Charlotte wouldn't dare cross her again—unless she wanted it broadcast on every billboard in Newport City.

She was mid-recording when a hand fisted in the back of her collar.

"That's enough."

Nathaniel's voice was glacial as he hauled her out of the room like an unruly kitten.
###Chapter 60

Vivian shoved against his chest with all her strength. "Ethan, have you lost your mind?!"

"Don't ruin the moment," he murmured against her neck.

"This is completely inappropriate! You shouldn't be seeing this!"

His tone turned paternal, as if shielding some naive schoolgirl from corrupting influences.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "I'm not some sheltered child. I've been around the block."

"Oh?" His lips curved. "Do enlighten me about your vast experiences."

The storm clouds cleared from his striking features, replaced by amused curiosity as he studied her reaction.

Her throat tightened as memories of their night together surfaced unbidden. Heat flooded her cheeks before she could stop it. His knowing smirk only confirmed his suspicions - she wasn't pregnant. Hell, she'd probably never been properly touched before!

Cassandra fled the room moments later, flustered and eager to deflect blame. "Are you alright, Miss Lockhart? I never imagined Micah would behave so...indecently. He didn't...take liberties, did he?"

The trap was obvious. No one would believe a notorious playboy and a woman spent hours alone without incident.

Vivian's laugh held an edge. "Would you be terribly disappointed if I said nothing happened, Miss Delacroix? Though I suppose that spiked wine you served me should have guaranteed otherwise."

Cassandra blanched but recovered quickly. "I don't know what you mean! I only wanted to apologize for our past misunderstandings. Charlotte brought the wine - you should ask her about its contents."

"Really?" Vivian arched a brow. "Because we both know Charlotte lacks the cunning for such schemes."

The blatant attempt to shift blame disgusted her. Poor Charlotte might be vicious, but at least she owned it.

Cassandra's eyes welled with crocodile tears. "I know you resent me for...for carrying Ethan's child. I'll pack my things and go—"

Like flipping a switch, she turned on the waterworks, playing the victim to perfection.

"Enough." Ethan's voice cut through the theatrics. He shot Vivian a warning look. "This is between you and Charlotte. Leave innocent parties out of it."

Turning to Cassandra, his tone softened. "Go rest. The stress isn't good for the baby."

Cassandra sniffled. "Forgive us for burdening you." With one last pitiful glance, she retreated, the picture of wounded dignity.

Vivian's nails bit into her palms. The irony burned - his precious mistress shed a few tears and he rushed to comfort her, while the twins in her own womb had nearly been poisoned tonight!

She couldn't stand another second in this gilded prison. "Have my belongings brought down. I'm leaving."

His brows drew together. "Charlotte crossed a line this time. I'll make her apologize."

Vivian nearly laughed. Since when did the man who let his family walk all over her suddenly grow a conscience?

"Save it. Just get my things."

She descended the stairs without waiting for a response, standing by the entrance like any other visitor awaiting their coat.

The symbolism wasn't lost on her - from mistress of Blackwood Estate to just another guest waiting to be shown the door.
###Chapter 61

Ethan Blackwood shoved the door open. His eyes landed on the scene before him—Micah Larson, clearly drugged, pinning Vivian Lockhart beneath him, attempting to force himself on her.

"Ethan, help me!"

Vivian's voice was desperate, her fingers clawing at the floor. Even though Micah was her boyfriend and they'd been intimate before, this was different. This was violation. Humiliation.

Ethan's gaze flickered over them, cold and detached. He snatched what belonged to Olivia Sinclair from the table without a second glance.

"Serves you right."

His words were sharp, final. He turned on his heel and walked out.

His spoiled cousin needed to learn consequences.

Downstairs, Vivian stood by the entrance, arms crossed. Ethan's frown deepened. "We're still married. You're still the lady of Blackwood Villa."

"No, thanks."

She snatched the items from his hand and strode away without another word.

Night had fallen. The estate was too remote for cabs. Vivian tapped her phone impatiently, but no drivers accepted the fare.

Moments later, a silver Bugatti Veyron purred to a stop beside her. Ethan's expression was unreadable.

"Get in."

Not a request. A command.

Vivian hesitated, then yanked open the passenger door.

Her breath caught.

An amber pendant lay on the seat—identical to the one she'd found at her parents' grave that morning.

Her pulse quickened. Had he been there? Had he left it?

But that made no sense. Why would he?

"Your pendant—"

"Don't touch my things."

He snatched it away, his tone icy.

Vivian scoffed. Of course. Wishful thinking.

Ethan Blackwood didn't care about her. Why would he remember her parents' death anniversary?

She turned to the window, willing the ride to end.

Then she noticed—they weren't heading toward Sunrise Heights.

"This isn't the way home. Where are we going?"

Ethan kept his eyes on the road. "You'll see."

"Stop the car. Now."

If she'd known he'd pull this, she'd have walked.

"Stay put."

The doors locked. The engine roared. The Bugatti shot forward, weaving through traffic.

Vivian gripped the seat. "Slow down! If you want to die, don't take me with you!"

She'd raced cars before. Speed didn't scare her. But the twins did.

"Relax. We're almost there."

Ten minutes later, they pulled up to The Midnight Club.

Vivian knew the place. Exclusive. Elite. Members-only.

Why bring her here?

"Out."

Ethan parked and unlocked the doors.

Vivian bolted—only for his hand to clamp around her wrist.

"You're accompanying me tonight."

She arched a brow. "We're divorcing. Why should I? What's in it for me?"

The old Vivian would've obeyed without question. Not anymore.

"One hundred thousand. Per minute."

"Deal."

Her lips curved. "Generous as always, Mr. Blackwood."

The waiter led them to the VIP suite—The Night Banquet. Laughter and chatter spilled into the hall.

The moment Ethan stepped inside, silence fell.

A man lunged forward, eyes wide. "Holy hell, Nate! You actually showed up?"
###Chapter 62

The voice belonged to Nathaniel Blackwood's childhood friend, Nathan Prescott.

Nathan's eyes widened comically when he spotted Vivian Lockhart standing beside Nathaniel. "Holy shit! Not only did Nate actually show up, but he brought his wife too? Miracles do happen! This calls for celebration!"

Nathaniel's chiseled features remained impassive as he strode forward. "I received the invitation. Naturally, I came."

Vivian trailed behind him, playing the perfect demure wife. At $100,000 per minute, she'd be damned if she didn't deliver an Oscar-worthy performance.

The private lounge screamed opulence. Crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light across marble floors, transforming the space into something out of a fairy tale.

Several affluent couples lounged on velvet couches. But the pair commanding center attention was impossible to miss.

The man wore rimless glasses that accentuated his aristocratic features. His piercing gaze radiated quiet authority - the unmistakable mark of old money. The platinum Rolex on his wrist? One-of-a-kind. Worth over ten million.

The stunning woman beside him could've stepped off a Parisian runway. Hers was the kind of beauty that made even socialites insecure.

They made a striking couple. Equally matched in looks and status.

Both froze when Nathaniel entered.

"Nathaniel, you—" The woman stood abruptly, emotions flashing across her face.

Her companion remained composed. "I'm glad you're no longer angry enough to avoid us."

Nathaniel pocketed his hands, regarding them with cool amusement. "What else would bring me here?"

Vivian's gaze darted between the trio. Oh, this was juicy. There was definitely history here.

Tension thickened the air. No one dared breathe too loud.

Nathan broke the silence, handing out champagne flutes with forced cheer. "Enough! Four years is too long for the golden trio to be apart. Let's drink!" He raised his glass. "To reconciliation!"

The seated man stood, clinking glasses with Nathaniel and Nathan. "Four years too long indeed." He drained his flute in one go.

Then his attention shifted to Vivian. "You must be the woman Nathaniel married four years ago. Vivian, correct?"

"Pleasure to meet you." Vivian flashed her most polished smile. $100,000-a-minute smile.

"Dominic Harrington. My apologies for missing your wedding. I'll make it up with three shots."

Vivian waved him off. "Nathaniel speaks of you often. Says he's missed you terribly."

Nathaniel choked on his champagne. Since when?

Dominic's eyes lit up. "You're as gracious as they say. Nathaniel's a lucky man."

Vivian bit her tongue. At this rate, she deserved a fucking raise.

Nathan scoffed. "Lucky? She's some down-on-her-luck nobody. Nathaniel, just because Olivia dumped you doesn't mean you had to settle for this—"

"Dumped?" Vivian's voice turned razor-sharp. Her gaze swept the room like a predator scenting blood. "Who the hell dared dump my husband? Point her out."
###Chapter 63

The entire VIP lounge went deathly silent.

No one had anticipated Vivian's sudden outburst. The delicate-looking woman had just revealed claws no one knew she possessed.

"My husband is absolute perfection. Who in their right mind would ever let him go?"

She punctuated her declaration by wrapping both arms possessively around Ethan's bicep, pressing close in a show of wifely devotion.

Pure theater, of course.

But this performance served her curiosity well. She needed confirmation of her suspicions.

The elegant woman on the sofa immediately averted her gaze, shoulders tensing.

Dominic's jaw visibly tightened.

Nathan sprang to the woman's defense, sneering, "What does it matter who ended things? If Olivia was Ethan's first love, she's clearly a hundred times the woman you'll ever be! Know your place - you're from completely different worlds. Why force this sham marriage? You're doing neither of you any favors!"

Dominic's usually warm eyes frosted over. "That's enough, Nathan," he warned, voice deceptively soft.

But Nathan barreled on like a petulant child. "Am I wrong? She's not fit to shine Olivia's shoes."

Olivia?

Vivian's eyebrow arched. So this was the legendary Olivia Sinclair.

"Don't be ridiculous, Nathan. You'll make our guests uncomfortable." Olivia finally lifted her head, offering Ethan and Vivian a gracious smile. "Nate, it's been too long."

"Indeed," Ethan replied evenly.

Olivia's delicate brows knitted together. "Are you still angry with Dominic and me? This is all my fault - I was so foolish, confusing friendship with love. I never meant to come between you two. I'm just so glad you're here tonight!"

"The past is irrelevant." Ethan's tone remained glacial, his striking features impassive. The distance between them might as well have been miles.

Nathan threw up his hands. "For God's sake, it's ancient history! Must we all act like strangers because of some teenage romance? We grew up together, for Christ's sake!"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the group.

"Exactly! Dominic and Olivia are happy, and Mr. Blackwood clearly adores his wife. Everyone wins!"

Under mounting social pressure, Vivian found herself seated directly between Ethan and Olivia.

What a tableau.

Vivian's gaze flicked between the stone-faced billionaire on her right and the porcelain-skinned socialite on her left. An unexpected thrill shot through her.

His first love left him for his best friend? And now the victim was expected to play nice? The sheer audacity!

Who knew the formidable Nathaniel Blackwood harbored such heartbreak?

No wonder he'd dragged her here under false pretenses, offering obscene sums for this charade. Alone, this gathering would've been torture.

Her role as his fake wife suddenly felt like a sacred duty. The stakes had just skyrocketed.

'Don't worry, soon-to-be-ex-husband. As fellow members of the betrayed club, I'll make sure we dominate tonight.'

She flashed Olivia a dazzling smile. "Ms. Sinclair, I really must thank you."

Olivia blinked. "Pardon?"

"If you hadn't foolishly let this incredible man slip through your fingers, I'd never have gotten my chance." Vivian sighed dramatically, resting her head on Ethan's shoulder. "He's perfect - devastatingly handsome, generous beyond reason, an amazing cook. I hit the jackpot!"

Ethan sat ramrod straight, expression unreadable. He hadn't anticipated this level of commitment to the act.

Leaning in as if for an intimate whisper, he hissed through clenched teeth, "Rein it in. You're overdoing it."

Olivia's manicured fingers curled into her palms, her smile faltering.

Nathan seized the opportunity. "Damn right you should thank her! Do you even know who you're talking to? Without Olivia stepping aside, you'd still be waiting in line!"

Vivian's eyes sparkled with genuine curiosity. "Do enlighten me."
###Chapter 64

"Hah, just wait till you find out!"

Nathan Prescott puffed out his chest proudly. "Do you know Cambridge University? Olivia studied astrophysics there - their most challenging program. Her research paper even won first prize in the Starburst Competition!"

"Wow, you're truly exceptional, Olivia!"

The crowd gazed at Victoria Sinclair with admiration. Their reaction wasn't exaggerated - it was rare for someone born into privilege to excel academically. An astrophysics prodigy was genuinely impressive.

Victoria gave a modest smile. "It's not that I'm special. I just chose a topic the judges favored."

"Stop being so humble! Own your achievements!"

Nathan shoved his hands in his pockets, shooting Vivian Lockhart a condescending look. "Do you even know what astrophysics is? I doubt a sheltered housewife like you has ever heard of it."

Vivian chuckled, swirling her orange juice without rising to the bait.

She turned to Victoria. "Was your winning paper titled 'The Celestial Crown - On the Interplay Between the Sr Emissive Layer and Troposphere'?"

Victoria's smile faltered. Shock flashed across her face. "That's correct. Have you... read it? Do you study astrophysics?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Nathan scoffed. "She's a homemaker who reads cookbooks. There's no way she could comprehend advanced academic work."

Ethan Blackwood finally spoke, his voice calm but cutting. "Actually, she can."

The crowd gasped.

Ethan took a deliberate sip of wine before continuing. "Because she was one of the five anonymous judges for the Starburst Competition."

"What?!"

Jaws dropped. Eyeballs nearly popped from sockets.

Victoria looked utterly shaken. "You're... the mysterious MISS-C judge?"

"It's ancient history. Nothing worth mentioning."

Vivian shot Ethan a questioning glance. How did he know about this carefully guarded secret?

"Coincidentally," Ethan continued, a smirk playing on his lips, "my wife also graduated top of her class in electromagnetic wave theory. Though honestly, such skills are rather... mundane."

The humblebrag hung in the air.

Silence descended.

"You're incredible," Dominic Harrington murmured, looking at Vivian with newfound respect. He'd always known Ethan wouldn't marry someone ordinary.

Victoria lowered her head, frustration simmering beneath her perfect facade. For once, she wasn't the star.

Nathan, realizing his blunder had backfired, scrambled to recover. "Academic achievements mean nothing! Olivia's a polymath - far superior to some bookworm. If you can beat her at anything else, I'll kneel before you!"

Vivian sighed internally. 'When will this end?'

Undeterred, Nathan pulled out his phone challengingly. "I dare you to take yours out!"
###Chapter 65

"Why wouldn't I dare?"

Vivian didn't know what game Nathan was playing this time, but she wasn't about to back down. She pulled out her phone with confidence.

Maybe, deep down, she wanted to prove herself against Olivia.

After all, Olivia was Ethan's unforgettable first love. Vivian couldn't help but wonder what made her so special.

"Did you download Apex Legends on your phone?"

Nathan's gaze grew even more admiring as he looked at Olivia. "Liv isn't just brilliant—she's also a pro gamer. Apex Legends is the hottest game right now, and she's ranked third in Paris!"

Vivian smirked. "Is that so? Then let's skip the small talk and play a round."

"You know how to game?"

Nathan looked genuinely surprised.

This quiet wife of Ethan's wasn't as dull as he'd assumed.

Still, he figured she was just a noob who stood no chance against Olivia.

Humiliated from her earlier loss, Olivia was eager to reclaim her pride. "Fine, let's make it quick. Just for fun."

They logged into the game, their screens projected onto the massive LCD display.

The crowd wasn't expecting much—just another quick slaughter.

But after three rounds, Vivian matched Olivia's score almost perfectly.

As the game intensified, Vivian's moves became smoother, sharper—professional-level precision.

Olivia started to panic. Sweat beaded on her forehead, her fingers flying desperately across the screen.

If she lost this final round, the embarrassment would be unbearable.

"Spin!"

"Cover!"

"Watch out—they're going for the crystal!"

The room held its breath, as if watching a championship match.

With one flawless strike, Vivian landed the final hit, securing victory.

"Holy shit!"

"That was insane! Please, let me join your team!"

The crowd erupted, some nearly dropping to their knees in awe.

Nathan, who'd been lounging on the couch waiting for Vivian to fail, tumbled right off. "No way. That was pure luck!"

Vivian set her phone down calmly. "You said she's third in Paris. So, who's first?"

Nathan, a hardcore fan, answered instantly. "The top player is Everheart_Hunter—wait." His eyes widened. "That's... similar to your name. Are you Everheart_Hunter?"

She gave a faint smile. "Guilty."

The room exploded.

Ethan, who never played mobile games, had been watching with detached indifference. But at the mention of her ID, his gaze sharpened.

"You're Everheart Hunter?"

So, she was the author behind that viral article?

"What if I am?"

His reaction puzzled her. Why did he care if he didn’t even game?

Dominic stood, grinning. "Top student and gaming legend? Seems like Ethan upgraded. Olivia and I are getting engaged next month. I hesitated to tell you, but now that you've moved on with someone even better, I hope you'll both attend."

Ouch. Getting cuckolded and then forced to congratulate them? Brutal.

Vivian stole a glance at Ethan, half-expecting him to snap.

But his expression remained unreadable. "Don’t worry. I’ll be there—with a gift."

Olivia’s face darkened, her fists clenching.

On the drive back, Vivian kept sneaking glances at Ethan, debating whether to say something.

"Problem?" he asked coolly.

She finally caved. "Look, I get it. Being betrayed by someone you love sucks. If you need to... vent, go ahead."

Ethan had moved on from Olivia long ago. His distraction came from processing Vivian’s secret identity.

But since she was offering comfort, he decided to play along.

He pulled over abruptly, leaning into her space, his arm braced against her seat. "You’re right. I’m devastated." His voice dropped, teasing. "Since we’re married... how exactly do you plan to comfort me?"
###Chapter 66

"How... do you want me to make you feel better?"

Vivian's voice was soft, her back pressed firmly against the leather seat. Her wide, innocent eyes searched his face.

Honestly, she wasn't sure what to feel.

She should have been triumphant. Seeing the mighty Nathaniel Blackwood in such a vulnerable state should have been satisfying.

Yet, the raw pain in his expression twisted something inside her.

"The best way to forget someone is time and a new love." His voice was rough. "I have time. But a new love..."

Nathaniel's gaze burned into her. He tilted her chin up with one finger, his voice dropping to a whisper.

"People say you're an upgraded version of Olivia Sinclair. Why don't you play her stand-in for a few minutes? Give me a comforting kiss."

He closed his eyes. His sculpted features were flawless in the dim light, his lips parting slightly as he leaned in.

Most women would melt.

The old Vivian might have too.

But now? Her mind was razor-sharp. Her fingers curled into fists.

You want me to be a replacement?

Over my dead body.

She tensed, ready to throw him off.

Then—her sharp hearing caught it. A faint, rhythmic beeping beneath the hum of the engine.

"Don't move!"

Nathaniel's eyes flew open, dark with frustration. "You're rejecting me?"

"Shut up!" Her voice was urgent. "There's something wrong with your car!"

Instantly, his demeanor shifted. The playfulness vanished, replaced by cold alertness.

"Hear that? That beeping—"

Nathaniel stilled, listening.

Sure enough. A steady, ominous pulse came from beneath the driver's seat.

Vivian's throat tightened. "If I'm right... there's a bomb under your seat."

His face went rigid.

For the first time, the unshakable Nathaniel Blackwood looked shaken.

He moved to check, but she shoved him back. "Stay still unless you want us both blown to pieces!"

Being ordered around was new for him. Strangely, he didn't mind it.

He exhaled sharply. "Fine. What's the plan?"

"We dismantle it."

She inhaled deeply, steadying herself. Drawing on years of training, she slid into the driver's seat and bent down.

It should have been terrifying.

But Nathaniel was... distracted.

The way her hair cascaded over one shoulder, the scent of her perfume, the curve of her back as she moved—

His jaw clenched. He forced his gaze out the window.

Vivian didn't notice. Her focus was entirely on the device.

A compact timer, two minutes left.

Simple wiring—red, yellow, blue. Child's play compared to what her grandfather had taught her.

"Status?" Nathaniel's voice was tight.

"Two minutes. Scissors. Now."

He didn't question her. A sleek pair was in her hand within seconds.

She worked quickly, fingers steady despite the ticking clock.

The beeping grew faster.

Nathaniel's knuckles whitened. Fear wasn't something he acknowledged—but the thought of her getting hurt?

"Done yet?"

"Finished a minute ago."

He blinked. "What?"

She smirked. "Had to be sure."

The realization hit him. She'd let him sweat.

His eyes narrowed. "You little—"

She dodged his half-hearted swipe, grinning. "You really need to work on your people skills. Who did you piss off this time?"

"I believe you owe me for saving your life. Again."

The tension between them shifted, charged with something unspoken.

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "Since when do you dismantle bombs?"

"Since Grandpa Arthur decided dolls were too boring for me." Pride colored her voice. "By ten, I could field-strip a rifle."

It should have sounded impossible. But remembering she was General Lockhart's granddaughter? It made sense.

Top student. Champion gamer. Bomb expert. What else was she hiding?

Vivian moved to sit up—then froze. A sharp pain lanced through her abdomen.
###Chapter 67

Ethan noticed her discomfort and frowned. "Are you okay?"

"Just a muscle cramp from squatting too long."

Vivian bit her lip and forced herself back into the passenger seat.

She couldn’t let him find out. Not now.

The moment they got home, Vivian collapsed onto the couch, barely able to move.

Her fingers trembled as she dialed Liam. "Get here. Now. I need the hospital."

Liam’s sports car screeched to a halt outside within minutes.

Tests. Needles. Cold hospital sheets.

She lay still, waiting for the verdict while Liam paced like a caged animal.

Obstetrics? Why?

The answer hit him like a freight train when the doctor returned.

"Six weeks pregnant?!"

The doctor adjusted his glasses, disapproval sharp in his tone. "This is a critical stage. You need rest. And you—" He glared at Liam. "Take better care of your wife!"

"Mild risk of miscarriage, but bed rest and oxygen should stabilize things."

Vivian exhaled. The babies were safe.

"Thank you, Doctor."

The nurse hooked her to monitors and left.

Silence. Then—

"WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL, VIV?" Liam exploded. "Since when? Who’s the—"

She cut him off with a glare. "Who do you think?"

Realization dawned. Liam’s knuckles whitened. "That bastard Nathaniel. Knocks you up, then parades his mistress? I’ll rip his—"

"Stop." Her voice cracked like a whip. "He doesn’t know. And he won’t. After the divorce, my children and I are done with him. Understood?"

Liam growled but nodded. "Fine. Ditch the sperm donor. Those kids deserve better."

"Swear you’ll keep this secret."

"To my grave." No hesitation.

Her throat tightened. Liam always had her back.

This scare made one thing clear—time was running out.

She needed Lockhart Enterprises secured ASAP.

"Did all the defectors from Blackwood Group sign with us?"

"Most. Except Orion Capital. Their backing’s solid. Landing them would be huge."

"Get me a meeting."

Liam smirked. "The Osborne name still opens doors. Consider it done."

Exhausted, Vivian closed her eyes.

Next morning, the doctor cleared her discharge.

Liam hovered like a bodyguard, shielding her from prying eyes.

Neither noticed the paparazzo lurking across the street, camera clicking relentlessly.
###Chapter 68

Vivian Lockhart's body had fully recovered after several days of rest.

She clutched the freshly drafted share transfer agreement as she approached Blackwood Group's headquarters, determined to get Ethan Blackwood's signature.

The atmosphere at Blackwood Group was unusually tense today. Security barricades lined the perimeter of the building.

Rumors swirled that a high-profile delegation was touring the company. Reporters had gathered outside, cameras at the ready.

Vivian was halted at the security line. She'd have to wait until the event concluded before being allowed inside.

From a distance, she spotted Ethan. Dressed in a sharp black suit, he stood at the center of the lobby, effortlessly commanding attention as he posed for photographs with the visiting dignitaries.

His striking features and piercing gaze gave him an air of natural authority. He was magnetic, as always.

Then, chaos erupted in the crowd.

"Let me through! Don't you know who I am?"

A man was shoving past security, shouting toward Ethan.

Walter Reynolds.

Vivian's jaw tightened, her fingers curling into fists.

Walter, behaving like a common street thug, bellowed at the top of his lungs, "Nephew-in-law! Over here! I'm Vivian's uncle! You can't ignore me!"

Every camera in the vicinity swiveled toward him.

Mortifying.

Vivian stormed forward, her expression icy. "Shut your mouth, Walter! Have you no dignity?"

"Vivian! Perfect timing!" Walter grinned shamelessly. "Tell your husband to come here. We need to renegotiate the divorce settlement!"

"I won't stand by while my niece gets cheated out of what's rightfully hers!"

He was putting on a show, deliberately drawing attention.

He knew Blackwood Group was hosting a major event today—knew the press would be watching. This was his pathetic attempt to pressure Ethan into paying him off.

Humiliation burned through Vivian.

Worse, if Ethan took offense, he might retaliate by complicating the share transfer.

"Last warning, Walter. Leave now, or I'm calling the police."

Walter seized the opportunity to escalate. "Hear that, everyone? My niece has turned her back on her own family! Now she's threatening to have her uncle arrested!"

Ethan, who had been observing the commotion from a short distance, finally stepped forward.

Normally, he wouldn't bother with such nonsense. Security would handle it.

But Vivian was there.

His gaze flickered toward her small frame, his brow furrowing slightly.

Meanwhile, Vivian had reached her limit.

Dealing with shameless people was worse than dealing with outright villains. Engaging with them only dragged you down to their level.

"Walter, I said get lost!"

She grabbed his arm, trying to yank him away.

"No! I'm not leaving until Ethan gives me what I'm owed!"

With a rough shove, Walter sent Vivian stumbling backward.

Instinctively, she curled her arms around her stomach, protecting her unborn babies.

But before she could hit the ground, a strong arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her against a solid chest.

She turned her head.

Ethan Blackwood.

Surprise flickered through her. She hadn't expected the arrogant CEO to intervene.

After steadying her, Ethan turned to Walter, his voice dangerously calm.

"What exactly do you want from me?"
###Chapter 69

Ethan Blackwood's commanding presence made Walter Reynolds instinctively take a step back.

The flashing cameras gave him false courage. Surely the CEO wouldn't cause a scene with media present?

"What more could I want, dear nephew?" Walter cleared his throat dramatically. "My niece has been your devoted wife for years. Now you're throwing her away with just some measly company shares? How will she survive? The Blackwoods could afford to be more generous, don't you think?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Camera shutters clicked furiously.

"My poor niece is too shy to speak up, so she begged me all night to negotiate for her..."

"Let's make this simple. Seven million dollars and we vanish from your life forever!" Walter's greedy eyes gleamed.

"Walter Reynolds, shut your filthy mouth!" Vivian Lockhart hissed through clenched teeth.

His lies were destroying her reputation. She wanted to strangle him right there.

Vivian stole a glance at Ethan. To her surprise, he remained impassive - that same unreadable expression that intimidated everyone.

Towering like a god among mortals, he simply turned to his assistant. "Ethan Young, take him to Accounting."

Then he walked away without another word.

Just... like that?

Walter swallowed hard. He hadn't expected seven million to come so easily.

He'd actually brought a pocket knife, prepared to fake self-harm for blackmail purposes.

Had he known his nephew-in-law would be this compliant, he would've demanded twenty!

After a few steps, Ethan suddenly turned back. His icy gaze pinned Vivian, who stood frozen in confusion. "Aren't you coming?"

Snapping to attention, Vivian hurried after him.

Ethan calmly reintroduced Vivian to the visiting delegates as his wife.

Composing herself, Vivian greeted them with perfect poise. Her elegant demeanor earned admiring nods.

The meeting concluded smoothly with handshakes and photographs.

Vivian finally exhaled. Disaster averted.

If Walter had ruined this important visit, she'd never forgive herself - and neither would Ethan.

The elevator doors closed on the CEO's private lift, and all pretense of marital harmony vanished. Silence thickened the air between them.

As the elevator ascended, Vivian risked a sideways glance.

Ethan's expression could freeze hell itself.

She guessed he was furious. Walter's spectacle would undoubtedly damage both his reputation and Blackwood Group.

"About earlier..." She cleared her throat. "Walter's a parasite. Don't give him that money or he'll keep coming back for more."

Ethan didn't even look at her. "If you wanted more alimony, you should've asked directly instead of staging this pathetic charade."

So he did blame her!

Vivian opened her mouth but no words came. How could she possibly explain?

The elevator dinged at the executive floor.

Ethan strode out to find a handsome figure leaning against the floor-to-ceiling windows, smirking. "Finally done playing host, Mr. CEO? Got time for me now?"

Vivian's stomach dropped.

Perfect. Just when she thought things couldn't get worse.
###Chapter 70

Julian Blackthorn leaned against the wall, hands tucked in his pockets as he smirked at Vivian Lockhart. "What a surprise. Mrs. Blackwood herself. The show's about to start—wouldn't want you to miss your starring role, would we?"

Vivian's grip tightened around her purse. The threat in his words was unmistakable.

This wasn't a bluff. If she refused to cooperate, he'd expose Scarlet Phoenix to the world before Ethan could transfer those shares.

"Julian Blackthorn," she forced a smile, stepping closer. "I've admired your work for years. Could we talk? Privately?"

Desperation clawed at her, but she wasn't done fighting. Maybe, just maybe, he'd hesitate before ruining her.

His smirk deepened, eyes glinting with amusement. "How could I refuse the CEO's wife?"

They both turned to Ethan, still standing between them like a storm cloud.

The silent request was clear: Leave.

Ethan's expression turned glacial. "Five minutes."

He strode into his office without another glance, the air turning frigid in his wake.

The moment the door shut, Vivian seized Julian by the collar and slammed him against the wall. "Listen carefully," she hissed, fingers pressing into his throat. "Expose me, and I'll make sure you regret it."

Julian didn't flinch. Instead, his eyes sparkled with delight. "Scarlet Phoenix—brilliant hacker, deadly fighter. I'm even more impressed now."

"Shut up!"

She clamped a hand over his mouth, pressing closer to muffle his voice.

Julian went still. His breath hitched as her silky hair brushed his cheek, the faint scent of jasmine teasing his senses.

Vivian frowned, suddenly aware of their proximity. "Nod if you understand."

He obeyed.

She released him, and Julian exhaled dramatically, grinning. "Last chance, Vivian. Help me take down the Blackwoods, and your secret stays safe. Otherwise—"

"There is no otherwise." Her voice was steel. "I don't respond to threats. If you expose me, you'd better sleep with one eye open."

Julian chuckled. "Still protecting Ethan? Even after everything? When he finds out you're the reason Blackwood Group is crumbling, do you think he'll let you walk away?"

"Do what you want."

She was done arguing. After Walter Reynolds' stunt, Ethan was already furious. What was one more disaster?

Julian disappeared into Ethan's office. Ten agonizing minutes later, he emerged.

Vivian braced herself.

His lips curved. "Your turn. I told him everything." He winked. "Call me if you need help."
###Chapter 71

Vivian inhaled sharply before stepping into Ethan's office.

The silhouette of Ethan's lean frame stood outlined against the floor-to-ceiling windows. The sunlight accentuated his broad shoulders and long legs, giving him an almost regal presence.

Yet the glacial aura surrounding him turned the room into an icebox.

Clearly, the human glacier knew everything now.

But Vivian remained composed. She calmly produced the share transfer agreement. "Mr. Blackwood, if you have a moment, please sign this. A clean asset division will make our divorce proceedings smoother."

Ethan turned. The sunlight softened his sharp features, making his handsome face even more striking.

"Why the rush? Shouldn't you explain yourself first?"

"Explain?" Vivian's expression didn't waver. She had nothing left to lose. "First, Walter Reynolds demanded seven million from you on his own accord. Believe what you will."

"Second, the security flaws in Blackwood Group's database existed long before I pointed them out. I simply gave you advance warning. Retaliate if you must."

"Third, our divorce agreement clearly states Lockhart Enterprises belongs to me. The courts will enforce it regardless of your signature."

Ethan studied her with an inscrutable gaze. After a long pause, he said coldly, "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Was I unclear? Make your move then! Stop wasting time!"

Vivian braced herself. The man always settled his debts. She'd face whatever came head-on.

Ethan's frown deepened. "That hacker claimed you're his ex. That you're divorcing me to reunite with him. Explain."

"What?! His ex?" Vivian nearly choked. "That's what he told you?"

"What else should he have said?"

"Complete fabrication!" Vivian raised two fingers. "I swear on my future husband's painful death, I barely know the man!"

Ethan: "..."

Oddly, he felt personally cursed.

But Vivian's vehement denial seemed genuine. His stormy expression eased slightly.

"Aside from that nonsense... did he say anything else?" Vivian ventured.

"No."

"Good. That's... good."

She exhaled in relief.

A false alarm! Julian Blackthorn might be eccentric, but he had some honor among thieves.

Suddenly Ethan closed the distance, backing her against the desk. His voice dropped. "From your reaction, it seems there's history between you two?"

"Absolutely not!" Vivian's cheeks warmed. Why was he so close?

"What did you discuss alone earlier?" He stepped closer still.

Through their clothes, she felt his body heat, his steady heartbeat. The air between them grew charged.

'Damn it! Is this appropriate for soon-to-be-divorced people?'

Just as she thought he might kiss her, Ethan retreated, his usual aloof mask back in place. Almost cheerfully, he extended his hand. "Give me the papers."
###Chapter 72

"Which documents?"

Vivian felt like she could finally surface for air. Her mind cleared instantly. Those sharp eyes focused intently.

"Wasn't it you who wanted me to sign the equity transfer agreement? Hand them over before I reconsider!"

Nathaniel's voice carried that familiar icy arrogance.

He actually agreed?!

Vivian could hardly believe it. She immediately presented the contract and pen with both hands, movements precise and respectful.

"Right here, Mr. Blackwood."

She barely dared to breathe during the entire process, terrified this volatile man might change his mind over some imagined slight.

Nathaniel signed with mechanical precision before delivering his ultimatum in that detached tone. "The divorce settlement terms stay confidential. If you want something, ask directly. No need for underhanded tactics."

Each word struck like an icicle - sharp, cold, painful.

Vivian froze.

She'd thought his quick compliance meant he hadn't believed Walter's accusations.

Apparently, she'd been wrong.

Not that it mattered anymore. Vivian was done explaining herself.

They were divorcing anyway. His opinion of her held no weight now.

His sudden cooperation probably just ensured their clean break.

"Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Blackwood. Barring complications, we only need to see each other once more - when we finalize the divorce. After that..."

Vivian secured the signed contract and left without a backward glance.

Nathaniel's glacial stare remained fixed on the empty doorway long after she'd gone.

Her eagerness to escape him was palpable.

It puzzled him. She'd forfeited $40 million in alimony for that failing law firm.

What game was she playing?

Did she not realize how incompetent Blackwood Legal's partners were? Could she possibly handle them?

Next morning.

Vivian rose early. Professional makeup, polished leather heels - she marched toward Blackwood Legal with determined energy.

Though technically a Blackwood Group subsidiary, the firm operated independently.

Beyond handling corporate legal matters, they'd once accepted private cases too, sharing only annual profits with the parent company.

But backed by the Blackwood empire, the lawyers grew complacent. Private cases dwindled to zero.

Now they just collected paychecks while the firm bled money annually.

Every December, the three absentee partners miraculously appeared to demand Blackwood Group subsidies.

The corporation had wanted to ditch these parasites for years. Contractual obligations prevented it.

By taking the firm off their hands, Vivian had actually done them a favor.

The address led her to a dilapidated building beyond the Fourth Ring Road.

The rusted "Blackwood Legal" sign looked ready to crash down any second.

Exactly the cesspool she'd expected.

This only fueled Vivian's determination.

Inside, only a janitor wiping desks occupied the space.

Eventually a lawyer wandered in. Before she could speak, he dismissed her. "Take your lawsuit next door. We're not accepting clients."

Vivian's lips pressed tight. She approached the janitor instead. "Mr. Caldwell, might I have a word?"
###Chapter 73

The man wore casual clothes and a face mask. His hands moved carefully as he polished each leaf of the office plant, ensuring not a speck of dust remained.

At the sound of Vivian's voice, he glanced up, curiosity flickering in his eyes. "Ah, the new head of Blackwood Legal? The woman Ethan Blackwood is about to discard?"

Vivian suppressed a wince. "The second part wasn't necessary."

Setting down the spray bottle, he removed his mask, revealing the kind, middle-aged face that matched the intel perfectly.

From the dossier Nathaniel had provided, Vivian knew Blackwood Legal had three senior partners—two men and one woman—and Gregory Caldwell was the eldest.

And the most dangerous.

Despite his gentle appearance, Gregory was the sharpest of them all.

"How did you recognize me?" he asked, tilting his head. "We've never met, and I was in disguise."

"Simple." Vivian shrugged. "As your new boss, I did my homework. Gregory Caldwell is known for his obsession with plants. No janitor would polish leaves with that much devotion."

A slow grin spread across his face. "Clever girl. But if you've truly researched us, you'd know we're not an easy bunch to handle. A smart woman would walk away."

Vivian's eyes gleamed. "Lucky for me, I love a challenge."

Her confidence was unshakable, her posture radiating the same indomitable spirit that ran in the Lockhart bloodline.

Gregory chuckled. "Ethan couldn't tame us in three years. You really think you can?"

"I don't need three years," she shot back. "Three days will be enough."

"Bold words. Good luck with that." With a meaningful smirk, he walked away.

Blackwood Legal was a mess.

The partners were rarely present, and the lawyers beneath them were just as defiant. None of them took their new boss seriously—except for one.

Harrison Ford, a junior associate, was the only one who showed her respect.

The conference room remained empty long after the scheduled meeting time.

Harrison hesitated before speaking. "Boss, Mr. Montgomery said there's an important match tonight. He gathered the team to prepare for the livestream, so... they won't be coming in today."

"A match?" Vivian arched a brow. "The LCL Season 7 Grand Finals?"

Harrison's eyes widened. "You know about LCL?"

It was a niche game, beloved only by hardcore enthusiasts. How did a woman like her—supposedly just a wealthy socialite—know about it?

Vivian smiled faintly. "Tell Julian and the others to enjoy the game. I'll send snacks for the watch party."

By 9 PM, the finals were at their peak. Team Raging Storm, trailing 1-2 against Team Victory, staged a stunning comeback, securing the championship. The club erupted in cheers.

Vivian arrived with champagne and sushi.

Julian Montgomery, the youngest but most arrogant of the partners, was celebrating wildly.

"Team Raging Storm won! Let's celebrate!" Vivian announced, raising a bottle.

Julian scoffed. "What do you know about Team Raging Storm? Ever even played the game?"

Vivian smirked. "Not only do I know them—we're old friends."

"Sure you are." He rolled his eyes.

Her grin turned sly. "If I get them to come here tonight, will you promise me one thing?"
###Chapter 74

Three days had slipped by.

The Starlight Lounge stood as one of Newport City's most renowned bars. Its two-story structure exuded elegance with an artistic flair.

Nathan Prescott and Dominic Harrington occupied the VIP section on the upper floor. The spot offered both privacy and a perfect vantage point.

They'd already downed several drinks, but Ethan Blackwood—who'd promised to meet them—was still absent.

"What's with Ethan? This was supposed to be our first reunion in four years, just the three of us. He wouldn't actually bail, would he?"

Nathan swirled his wine glass, his expression tense. His gaze kept darting toward the entrance.

"I called him here today because I need his help with something urgent. If I don't get this sorted, my father's going to break my legs when I get home tonight!"

Dominic, ever the composed one of their trio, took a slow sip of his drink. "Relax. You know how Ethan is. If he's not in the mood, he won't show. It's not like this is the first time he's stood us up."

Nathan couldn't settle. Only Ethan had the connections to fix his mess.

"That's it. I'm calling him."

He pulled out his phone and dialed.

On the other end, Ethan sounded brisk, his voice clipped. He told them to start without him—if he couldn't make it, they shouldn’t wait.

"Seriously, man? You're really ditching us?"

Nathan was scrambling for a way to lure his workaholic friend out when movement at the entrance caught his eye.

A group of five or six young, vibrant figures walked in.

His breath hitched when he spotted the woman in the white dress—raven-haired, radiant.

Vivian Lockhart.

She was laughing, leaning close to whisper something to a man beside her. The intimacy between them was unmistakable.

Ethan was about to hang up. Nathan blurted, "You'd better get here fast, or you're going to lose your wife. Your darling Vivian is cozying up to some guy right now. Looks like she's having the time of her life."

Silence.

Then the sharp snap of a laptop closing.

"The Starlight Lounge? I'm on my way."

Dominic had noticed Vivian too. A faint smile curved his lips. "Ethan's wife seems... different from last time. Fascinating woman."

Downstairs, Vivian and Julian Montgomery claimed a booth large enough for eight.

Three days ago, the lawyers had looked down on her. Now, she was the center of their universe.

The once-arrogant Julian now hovered around her like an eager puppy.

"Boss, everything's handled exactly as you instructed. Any chance you could invite Team Inferno for another match? Let us mere mortals witness your god-tier skills again?"

Three days ago, Vivian had summoned Team Inferno—the reigning world champions—with a single call. Their captain had even bowed and called her "Master."

The lawyers had nearly prostrated themselves in awe. From that moment, she became their e-sports legend.

Vivian lifted her juice glass, clinking it against Julian's with a smirk. "Depends on your performance."

Before taking over the firm, she'd studied every member meticulously.

Most were in their twenties—except Gregory Caldwell and Victoria Chen, the senior partners.

Julian, the youngest of the three major partners, was unbeatable in court but embarrassingly inept at gaming.

Yet he obsessed over it, dragging the junior lawyers into marathon sessions.

Vivian had known from the start: win Julian over, and the rest would follow.

What better way than humiliating his idol in front of him?

So she wasn’t surprised that, in just three days, she’d tamed the pack of rebellious lawyers.

They were mid-laughter when the bar doors swung open.

Ethan stood there, tall and imposing.

His gaze locked onto Vivian—surrounded by admirers, radiant as the moon among stars.
###Chapter 75

A flicker of surprise crossed Ethan Blackwood's icy expression before it settled into a frown.

What had Vivian done to make Julian Montgomery pour drinks for her?

Three years ago, when Blackwood Group acquired Blackwood Legal, Julian's arrogance and blatant disrespect had left a lasting impression on Ethan.

But Julian's legal prowess was unmatched—he effortlessly resolved Blackwood Group's most complex cases—so Ethan had tolerated his attitude.

For years, Ethan had left the law firm to its own devices. Profit didn't matter as long as they delivered when needed.

Yet the lawyers had turned it into a glorified retirement home, bleeding money every year.

Vivian had traded $40 million and a luxury penthouse for this sinking ship. To Ethan, it was a fool's bargain.

With her limited experience, he was certain she'd fail to handle the firm's difficult personalities. When she did, she'd crawl back to renegotiate their divorce settlement.

But now, it seemed she'd already succeeded—in just three days?

Vivian and the lawyers hadn't noticed Ethan's arrival. He didn't approach them, heading straight for the VIP lounge upstairs instead.

Nathan Prescott was waiting, smirking. "Took you long enough. Too busy to hang out with us, but the second your wife's involved, you come running?"

"This isn't about her."

Ethan's reply was cold as he took his seat—a strategic position overlooking Vivian's table.

From the moment he sat down, his gaze locked onto her, unblinking.

Downstairs, Vivian was the center of attention, radiant as a blooming rose.

Her white dress contrasted sharply with her crimson lips—an intoxicating blend of innocence and seduction.

Was this how she'd tamed those stubborn lawyers?

The thought made Ethan's jaw tighten. He took a sharp sip of wine, an unfamiliar irritation prickling under his skin.

"Nathaniel, are you even listening?"

Nathan waved a hand in front of Ethan's face. "You've been staring at her since you got here. We should call you Stare-athaniel at this point. Pay attention!"

Only then did Ethan realize his focus had strayed. He forced his attention back. "What were you saying?"

Nathan exhaled dramatically. "Look, I need Julian Montgomery to take my case. I'm screwed if I lose this."

"I can assign you another lawyer. But Julian..."

Ethan's expression darkened. "He doesn't take orders from me."

"No way! You own the damn firm!"

Nathan ran a hand through his hair. "My new club's in trouble. A patron died from alcohol poisoning. Her family's suing, and the judge hinted we'll lose. The only similar case ever won was handled by Julian years ago."

Dominic Harrington chimed in. "Just ask him, Ethan. Having someone we know on the case reduces risks."

Ethan said nothing, his attention drifting back downstairs where Vivian's group had escalated to a drinking game.

His grip tightened around his glass. He couldn't sit still any longer.

Standing abruptly, he downed his wine. "Let's go."
###Chapter 76

The two men descended the staircase. Their striking appearances immediately drew admiring glances from the crowd.

Vivian's group remained oblivious, too engrossed in their drinking game to notice the newcomers.

For the first time in their lives, the two powerful men were completely ignored.

Nathaniel Blackwood wasn't accustomed to being overlooked. His temper flared on behalf of his friend Ethan. "How pathetic," he sneered. "Grown adults getting excited over childish drinking games."

The comment shattered the festive atmosphere like glass.

Ethan's gaze locked with Vivian's. An electric tension crackled between them.

No words were exchanged, yet everyone felt the invisible battle lines being drawn.

The new queen versus the former king. The lawyers held their breath, caught between two forces of nature.

They wisely retreated, creating a wide berth around the impending showdown.

Vivian broke the silence first. "Care to join us?" she challenged.

Before Nathaniel could refuse, Ethan had already taken a seat. "Why not," he said coolly.

Grumbling under his breath, Nathaniel reluctantly followed. He found himself seated beside Julian Montgomery - the only lawyer he respected.

Julian had always maintained professional distance from his former boss Ethan. But tonight, he decided to play peacemaker. "Since we're honored by the CEO's presence," he announced, "let's switch to a different game."

He produced a spinner. "Simple rules. Spin the arrow, pick someone to answer your question. Refusal means punishment."

"This is ridiculous!" Nathaniel stood abruptly.

Ethan remained seated, his expression unreadable. Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Fine. Let's get this over with."

Something was off. His workaholic friend never indulged in such frivolities. Was the legendary Ethan Blackwood actually humoring his wife?

The game began cautiously. With two intimidating figures present, questions stayed tame.

Then the arrow landed on Julian.

He didn't hesitate. "Mr. Blackwood," he asked boldly, "when did you lose your virginity?"

The room froze.

Every ear strained to hear. Vivian leaned forward, not wanting to miss a syllable.

Julian had asked what no one dared. The man was either brave or foolish.

Vivian imagined someone like Ethan must have started young. Unlike her own regrettably late and limited experience.

Ethan swirled his whiskey calmly. "I decline to answer."

Groans of disappointment filled the room.

Vivian rolled her eyes. Typical.

Julian grinned. "Then you'll face the consequence." He paused dramatically. "You must kiss number six for thirty seconds."
###Chapter 77

Julian Montgomery had every intention of humiliating the two arrogant heirs, Nathaniel Blackwood and Oliver Prescott.

That's why when handing out the numbered slips earlier, he deliberately gave number 6 to Oliver.

Just imagine. Two scions of Newport City's Elite Eight families locking lips for thirty seconds. What a scandalous spectacle. It would become legendary.

"Who has number six? Stand up now!"

Julian scanned the group knowingly, though he already had his answer.

Oliver, known for his fiery temper, shot up immediately. "Who the hell do you think you are? Trying to embarrass my brother? You got a death wish?"

Julian remained unfazed. The threat meant nothing to him.

As a top litigator for years, he'd faced all kinds of powerful people. Even those above Oliver Prescott's paygrade showed him respect.

"If you play the game, you accept the consequences. Since you gentlemen chose to join, you'll follow the rules."

Pulling out his phone, Julian activated the stopwatch. "Chop chop, boys. It's just a kiss. Two handsome men like you? Could be magazine cover material."

All eyes turned to the pair.

The pressure mounted.

Oliver cleared his throat dramatically. "Why's everyone staring at me? I'm not number six."

He turned to Nathaniel with mock sympathy. "Bro, take your pick. Plenty of decent-looking girls here. Thirty seconds won't kill you. But if number six turns out male, I'll flip this damn table myself!"

"Wait, you're not six?" Julian's brow furrowed. "What's your number then?"

"Take a good look. It's nine!" Oliver slammed his slip onto the table.

Indeed, it showed number nine.

Julian's jaw dropped. He'd made a critical error - mistaking the upside-down nine for a six.

But retreat wasn't an option now. "Then who has six? Step forward!"

At least watching the ice-cold CEO kiss someone would still be entertaining.

"Not me!"

"Not me either!"

Everyone displayed their slips - except Vivian Lockhart, who sat frozen with pink-tinged cheeks.

The answer became obvious.

Oliver exhaled loudly. "Lucky you, bro. Just your wife. Go ahead and plant one on her."

Nathaniel's gaze settled on Vivian. His expression remained unreadable. "I agreed to play. I'll accept the consequences."

He remembered those lips - perfectly plump, jelly-soft. That first taste had haunted him.

Recently he'd realized something: while he despised intimacy with women, with her it was different. Anticipated, even.

All eyes shifted to Vivian.

Their new boss and his wife of years - surely a kiss was nothing unusual between them?

Vivian drew a deep breath and finally looked up - not at Nathaniel, but at Julian. "This punishment is utterly boring."

Meaning: kissing Nathaniel would be boring.

Wasn't that... public humiliation?
###Chapter 78

Nathaniel noticed Vivian's discomfort and immediately stepped in.

"I agree this punishment is ridiculous. Wouldn't dare offend His Royal Highness Mr. Blackwood, so I'll forfeit my turn."

Eyebrows raised across the room.

The hypocrisy was glaring. Julian Montgomery had been all for the game moments ago.

His favoritism toward the new CEO couldn't be more obvious.

Ethan's expression remained unreadable, his chiseled features shadowed under the dim lighting.

His icy gaze locked onto the woman beside him. "Impressive charm. You've certainly won over the crowd."

Vivian stayed silent, fingers tightening around her glass.

Why the sarcasm?

She'd just saved him from humiliation. Shouldn't he be grateful? That stormy look made no sense.

Men.

The bottle spun again, landing on Nathan Prescott.

"Perfect!" Nathan grinned, sensing payback.

Time to teach Julian some manners.

The cocky lawyer had been practically draped over another man's wife all evening. Disgusting.

But Vivian's earlier rejection intrigued him. If she loved Ethan, why refuse that kiss?

Nathan turned directly to her. "Do you love your husband? Was he your first?"

Gasps rippled through the group.

Ethan's gaze sharpened, waiting.

Vivian met his stare. "I pass."

Groans of disappointment.

Typical. The new power couple played by the same rules - both terrible at this game.

"Silence speaks volumes," Nathan muttered, shooting Ethan a pitying look.

This was the woman he'd chosen over his first love? Tragic.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Just give me the punishment."

Nathan hesitated. He'd expected an easy answer - either confirmation or playful denial.

Her refusal said everything.

The stage lights dimmed as the current performance ended.

"Sing something," Nathan suggested, hoping to embarrass her.

Surely the brilliant lawyer couldn't carry a tune.

Vivian stood without hesitation, smoothing her dress.

She took the guitar, fingers dancing across strings. Two notes and the room stilled.

"Long ago, you were mine... Long ago, you left me behind..."

Her voice wrapped around the lyrics like silk, haunting and raw.

Tears welled in Nathan's eyes despite himself. "Damn it, why didn't you warn me she sings like an angel?"

"First time hearing it," Ethan murmured, gaze fixed on the stage.

Spotlights haloed Vivian, making her glow untouchable.

Upstairs, Dominic Harrington's grip tightened on his glass. Now he understood Ethan's quick recovery.

As the last note faded, Vivian descended gracefully. "Punishment complete. I'm leaving."

"If the boss goes, we go," her team chorused, following en masse.

The booth emptied, leaving Ethan and Nathan in awkward silence.

Finally, Ethan stood. "Let's go."

"Wait!" Nathan grabbed his arm. "What about introducing me to Julian Montgomery?"

"Not happening."

Nathan groaned. Might as well break his own legs now and save his father the trouble.
###Chapter 79

Vivian stepped out of The Starlight Lounge, bidding farewell to Julian and the other attorneys before standing alone by the curb.

The crisp night air caressed her skin, washing away the fatigue of the evening.

Her slender silhouette looked ethereal in the white cocktail dress, dark tresses dancing like silk in the gentle wind. Though her porcelain face showed little expression, a quiet melancholy lingered in her eyes - windows to untold stories.

Several cars slowed down, their drivers honking or whistling invitations. Each received nothing but her icy glare until they sped away.

When another luxury sedan pulled up, Vivian prepared to dismiss this latest admirer. Then the tinted window lowered to reveal Nathaniel Blackwood's chiseled profile.

Her expression hardened instantly, as if looking at a stranger.

"Need a ride?" His deep voice carried through the open window.

"Wouldn't dream of inconveniencing you." Her refusal came sharp as shattered glass.

Nathaniel's fingers tightened on the steering wheel. Inconvenience? They literally lived next door.

Her disdain couldn't be more obvious. She wasn't even pretending anymore.

This contradiction baffled him. If she truly felt nothing, why had she written that viral fanfiction about them? Unless...

She was putting on an act.

The realization lightened his mood considerably. He even forgave her public humiliation earlier. Women often said the opposite of what they meant, didn't they?

Leaning across the passenger seat, he tried a different approach. "Get in. I'll brief you about Blackwood Legal. The firm's more complicated than you think."

"I'm perfectly capable, thank you." Vivian arched her neck with regal poise. "More so than you, apparently."

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. "You think handling Julian Montgomery with petty tricks means you've won? He's not the real challenge at Blackwood Legal."

She knew he meant Victoria Chen - the formidable senior partner she hadn't yet faced. The true powerhouse behind the firm's success.

Without conquering that obstacle, Blackwood Legal would remain an unsolvable puzzle.

Nathaniel watched the subtle shift in her expression like a hawk tracking prey. Seeing her hesitation, he extended an olive branch.

"The divorce isn't finalized. If you're having second thoughts, get in and we'll renegotiate the terms. I'll accommodate any reasonable request." He paused meaningfully. "No need to keep using your uncle as an excuse."

In his mind, this was more than generous for an ex-husband. At least he wasn't stingy with the settlement.

Vivian's lips curved into a humorless smile. "How kind of you, Mr. Blackwood. But rest assured, every decision I've made since signing those papers came from conviction. Regret isn't in my vocabulary."

Some arrows, once loosed, could never be recalled. Some hearts, once broken, could never be revived by pretty words.

Nathaniel studied her intently, searching for any crack in her armor.

Just then, headlights flashed as a silver convertible pulled up behind them.

"Ah, my ride's here." Vivian brushed past his car with deliberate grace. Over her shoulder, she delivered the final blow: "Do remember our appointment at the courthouse next week. Wouldn't want you to...forget."
###Chapter 80

The sleek silver sports car glided through the city streets. Nathaniel Blackwood's grip on the steering wheel was precise, every movement calculated to ensure the smoothest ride possible for his precious cargo—the woman beside him and the twins she carried.

"Boss, you're absolutely reckless." Liam shook his head, his playful tone belying his concern. "A pregnant woman at a bar? That's terrible parenting before they're even born."

"It's a lounge restaurant." Vivian Lockhart rolled her eyes, resting her chin on her palm as she gazed out the window. "I didn't touch a single drop of alcohol."

Though Liam appeared carefree, his sharp eyes missed nothing. He recognized the tension in Vivian's posture immediately. "You're still thinking about Nathaniel, aren't you?" he prodded, half-teasing. "Since the divorce isn't finalized, why not tell him about the pregnancy? Let's see who he chooses."

"From what I've observed," Liam continued, "the Iceberg isn't completely indifferent to you. At the very least... he's still possessive."

That much was evident from the murderous glare Nathaniel had shot them when Vivian entered Liam's car earlier. In male psychology, possessiveness always signaled unfinished business.

"Besides," Liam added with a smirk, "you nearly died saving him. The least he could do is repay you with his body and choose you."

"Absolutely not!" Vivian's glare could have melted steel. "Why should I humiliate myself for his choice? What would I gain by returning?"

"To be that pathetic little wife everyone pities? The laughingstock whose husband openly keeps a mistress?" Her voice turned icy. "I'm not a masochist, Liam."

Possession wasn't love. True love ran bone-deep, like Nathaniel's devotion to Cassandra Delacroix.

"Bravo!" Liam's relief was palpable. "After four years of lovesick delusions, my boss has finally regained her senses. I'm so proud!"

"The babies will need a father figure though..." His fox-like eyes sparkled mischievously. "I volunteer as tribute."

Vivian raised a threatening fist. "Looking to get hospitalized?"

Liam immediately switched to puppy-dog mode. "Uncle it is! I'll be the world's best uncle!"

'Sigh. Liam Osborne, master seducer, rendered powerless by one woman.' Yet this secret bond they shared—something even the mighty Nathaniel Blackwood couldn't touch—warmed his heart.

"Enough nonsense." Vivian smoothed her windswept hair, all business now. "Did you handle what I asked?"

"Appointment secured. Ten tomorrow morning at Skyview Retreat."

Vivian nodded. "Good. I'll go alone."

"Not happening." Liam's playful demeanor vanished. "You're pregnant, and that old fox is Nathaniel's ally. If negotiations turn sour—"

"Since when have I needed protection?" Vivian arched an eyebrow.

Realization dawned on Liam. This was the legendary Scarlet Phoenix—a lethal panther disguised as a housecat. Those four years of docility had been an anomaly, not her nature.

"Fine. But call me immediately if anything feels off." His tone turned serious. "I'll be waiting for your signal."
###Chapter 81

The following morning.

Vivian Lockhart arrived at Skyview Retreat dressed in a tailored taupe pantsuit. Her chestnut hair was pulled back in a sleek ponytail.

She could easily pass for a recent university graduate with her youthful appearance.

Skyview Retreat nestled deep within an ancient forest fifty kilometers outside Newport City.

The exclusive resort boasted lush greenery, oxygen-rich air, natural hot springs, championship golf courses, and private fishing lakes. It was the preferred getaway for the elite.

Traffic delayed Vivian slightly. Her car pulled up at 10:01 AM—one minute late.

As she stepped out, she noticed a crowd gathered near the entrance, buzzing around a departing figure.

That man was Leonard Kingsley, CEO of Kingsley Holdings—the very person Vivian needed to meet.

Kingsley Holdings stood as a financial powerhouse with formidable influence. Among Newport City's top investment firms, they'd been Blackwood Group's most loyal partner for years.

The recent data breach at Blackwood Group had cost Kingsley Holdings millions. They'd immediately severed ties and were now vetting new partners.

Vivian strode toward the group of imposing executives. Her smile was polished as she positioned herself directly in Leonard's path. "Mr. Kingsley, I'm Vivian Lockhart. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Might we speak privately?"

Though petite in stature, her presence commanded attention. Most would find her confident tone impossible to refuse.

But Leonard Kingsley wasn't most people.

Since cutting ties with Blackwood Group, he'd become the most sought-after deal in the city. Countless opportunists like Vivian had approached him daily—all were dismissed without consideration.

"Vivian Lockhart." His assessing gaze traveled over her. "The fallen Lockhart heiress. The esteemed Blackwood daughter-in-law." A smirk twisted his lips. "Has Nathaniel become so desperate he's sending his wife to change my mind? How ruthless."

Vivian remained composed. "Nathaniel Blackwood and I operate separately. I'm here representing Lockhart Enterprises—this has nothing to do with Blackwood Group."

"So you're the mystery woman young Liam's been pestering me about?" Leonard's eyebrow arched, interest flickering.

He vaguely recalled seeing her at a gala years ago—just another decorative accessory on Nathaniel's arm. Pretty but forgettable.

This version of Vivian Lockhart was entirely different.

A golf cart approached from the nearby course.

"You intrigue me," Leonard admitted, "but I detest tardiness. You may leave."

Vivian had anticipated this.

She knew Leonard's reputation. If he were easily swayed, Liam would've secured the deal weeks ago.

"My apologies for the delay, Mr. Kingsley. As compensation, please accept this."

From her bag, she produced a plain brown paper parcel.

The surrounding executives exchanged disdainful glances.

As if Leonard Kingsley would be impressed by some trinket. The man received priceless gifts daily.

His assistant immediately blocked Vivian. "Mr. Kingsley doesn't accept unsolicited gifts. Mind your—"

Leonard's expression shifted abruptly when he glimpsed the parcel's markings. "Is that—?"
###Chapter 82

"Hand it over!"

Leonard Kingsley snatched the manila envelope, his fingers shaking with barely contained emotion as he pulled out the legal documents inside.

The crisp pages held a newly granted appeal verdict—one that meant everything to him.

Only Vivian Lockhart understood the true significance of this moment.

After what felt like an eternity, Leonard finally tore his gaze from the papers.

His sharp eyes glistened faintly as they locked onto Vivian. "Come with me."

Gasps rippled through the room as the young woman was granted a private audience with the formidable chairman of Kingsley Holdings.

Inside the lavish private suite, Leonard's composure cracked.

"It's overturned. After all these years... it's finally overturned." His voice was rough with emotion. "Five years... I've waited five damn years for this."

He kept rereading the verdict, as if expecting the words to change.

Vivian watched him, reminded painfully of her own father. "Justice always finds its way," she said softly. "I'm certain Natalie can feel your love from heaven."

Leonard's head snapped up, his gaze suddenly razor-sharp. "How did you know about this? And how the hell did you reopen a closed case?"

"Because I wanted to understand the man I hope to call my partner." Vivian met his stare unflinchingly. "The world knows Leonard Kingsley dotes on Isabella Thornton. But few know about Natalie Chase—your other daughter in that northern town."

"Natalie was two years older. More beautiful. More talented." Vivian continued quietly. "But fate dealt her a very different hand than Isabella."

Leonard's stern features softened with grief.

"Yes," he admitted hoarsely. "She was... extraordinary. If she hadn't been so damn considerate of my reputation—" His voice broke.

Vivian stayed silent, watching the powerful man crumble.

However flawed his past actions, his remorse was real. His love—undeniable.

The most heartbreaking love of all—a father mourning his lost child.

Leonard composed himself with visible effort, carefully replacing the documents.

"Overturning a five-year-old verdict... this couldn't have been easy." His voice steadied. "But at least now... her name is cleared."

His gaze turned assessing. "This gift strikes straight to the heart. So tell me—what do you really want?"

Vivian smiled, producing a contract and pen. "Exactly what I said—to be your most trusted partner. Specifically, I want Kingsley Holdings as Lockhart Enterprises' primary investor and distributor for the next five years."

Leonard actually laughed. "You're small but ambitious. In all of Newport City, only Blackwood Group could make that demand."

"In five years," Vivian countered smoothly, "Lockhart Enterprises will be more qualified than Blackwood Group to make it."

"Oh?" Leonard's eyebrow arched.

The bold claim should have sounded arrogant. From her lips, it simply sounded inevitable.

"You're Nathaniel Blackwood's wife, yet here you are negotiating for Lockhart Enterprises." His lips quirked. "Interesting."

Vivian pressed her advantage. "So, Mr. Kingsley? Will you take the gamble?"

A shrill voice cut through the moment.

"Move! I need to see him now!"
###Chapter 83

The door burst open with dramatic force.

A whirlwind of designer perfume and expensive fabrics stormed into the room.

"Daddy! I heard some gold-digging tramp was trying to sink her claws into you!"

Isabella Thornton stood there in thigh-high leather boots, clutching a rare Birkin bag. Her shrill voice carried through the private dining room like spoiled champagne bubbles.

Her gaze immediately locked onto Vivian Lockhart seated across from Leonard Kingsley. Recognition flashed across her petulant features.

"You!" Isabella spat through clenched teeth. "The woman Ethan Blackwood despises yet you still shamelessly chase after him!" Her eyes burned with venomous jealousy.

Vivian merely smiled, extending a graceful hand. "Miss Thornton. How flattering that you remember me."

She'd encountered Isabella before. The girl worshipped Ethan like some deity. Spoiled rotten by Leonard's indulgence, she'd grown into a walking tantrum in Prada.

Normally, Vivian would avoid such toxic personalities like the plague.

Today, fate had other plans.

"Don't you dare play innocent!" Isabella screeched, slapping Vivian's hand away. "I'm calling Ethan right now to expose your scheming!"

"Isabella! Enough!"

Leonard's rare stern tone made his daughter flinch. He rarely disciplined his precious girl.

"Mrs. Lockhart is here on legitimate business. Wait outside."

"Business? She's just some desperate housewife!" Isabella's voice cracked with theatrical sobs. "Mom would be heartbroken seeing you like this!" She stomped her designer heels. "I hate you!"

Leonard sighed heavily, the weight of decades-old guilt pressing down. Every tantrum only made him miss Natalie Chase more - the daughter he'd failed.

"Mrs. Lockhart," he said apologetically, "I'll review your proposal for Kingsley Holdings and Lockhart Enterprises. Would you mind giving us privacy?"

"Of course, Mr. Kingsley. I await your decision."

Vivian exited gracefully, but not without casting a pitying glance at Leonard.

Poor Natalie. That foolish, noble woman had sacrificed everything for the Kingsley name, only for this spoiled brat to reap the benefits. What a tragic waste.

Instead of leaving Skyview Retreat, Vivian positioned herself at the lounge bar. The contract remained unsigned - the game wasn't over yet.

Hours passed. Golden sunlight faded to twilight.

When patience wore thin, Vivian rose just as Isabella strutted out, triumph oozing from every pore.

"Give up. Daddy left through the VIP exit. He promised never to see you again!"

"Did he?" Vivian sidestepped the gloating girl. "I'd prefer to hear that from him directly."

The empty dining room confirmed Leonard's cowardice.

Pathetic. A titan of industry brought to heel by a brat's tantrum.

"I read your pathetic contract," Isabella sneered. "Helping another man while married to Ethan? Disgusting." Her smirk turned predatory. "But...I might be persuaded to help you."
###Chapter 84

The Gourmet Society.

An exclusive dining establishment in Newport City, favored by elite businessmen for networking and entertaining.

In their most opulent private dining room, The Crystal Room, Nathaniel Blackwood sat at the head of the table, basking in the flattery of his peers. The undisputed center of attention.

"You're truly in a league of your own, Mr. Blackwood. Under your leadership, Blackwood Group continues to break records! The rest of us can only aspire to reach such heights!"

The endless stream of compliments and toasts would have intoxicated most men.

But not Nathaniel. His piercing gaze remained unreadable, his regal demeanor setting him apart from the crude businessmen surrounding him.

Then a hesitant voice cut through the sycophancy. "With all due respect to Mr. Blackwood, there are other rising stars worth noting. Like Julian Montgomery from Lockhart Enterprises—his company's growth has been remarkable lately."

The sudden dissent created palpable tension. The speaker immediately faced ridicule.

"What nonsense! Julian Montgomery is just a playboy. He spends more time chasing women than running his business. How could he possibly compare to Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly. "Lockhart Enterprises?" he finally spoke.

The young man seized the opportunity. "Yes, sir. My family's in venture capital, so I've studied their operations closely."

"Though relatively new and small, their expansion has been aggressive. Contrary to popular belief, it's not just Julian's vanity project. Their potential is significant."

As others prepared to dismiss him again, Nathaniel's cold voice cut through. "Continue."

"My assessment isn't baseless. Their current clientele consists entirely of former Blackwood Group partners who terminated contracts recently."

This revelation caught the attention of several shrewd businessmen. Interest in the upstart company grew visibly.

Nathaniel fell into deep thought.

Ethan Young had mentioned the company before, but Nathaniel had dismissed it—just as he'd dismissed Julian Montgomery himself.

But now? That same playboy wasn't just making moves on Nathaniel's wife, but poaching his clients too. Nathaniel's estimation of him was rapidly changing.

The young man glanced nervously at Nathaniel. "There's more... though I'm not sure I should—"

"Speak," Nathaniel commanded.

"This morning, your wife visited Skyview Retreat to meet with Leonard Kingsley. Everyone assumed she represented Blackwood Group..."

"Instead, she presented lavish gifts on behalf of Lockhart Enterprises. Mr. Kingsley was reportedly delighted and ready to sign with them."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

Nathaniel's own wife aiding his rival? This development was... problematic.

Someone quickly tried to diffuse the tension. "Preposterous! There must be some mistake. Mrs. Blackwood is the epitome of loyalty. She'd never—"

Nathaniel swirled his wine glass absently, his handsome face betraying nothing.

"It's irrelevant. She's free to do as she pleases."

His tone was ice.

At that moment, the young man discreetly typed a message on his phone: "Mission accomplished. He's ready for you."
###Chapter 85

A waitress in an emerald qipao escorted Isabella Thornton into the Swan Hall.

"There you are, Ethan. You can't dodge me forever."

She marched straight to Ethan Blackwood's left side. The man seated there immediately surrendered his seat without hesitation.

All of Newport City knew Isabella Thornton—heiress to Kingsley Holdings, Leonard Kingsley's spoiled only daughter—was utterly obsessed with Ethan Blackwood.

Blackwood Group and Kingsley Holdings had been strategic partners for years.

Their ages and social status matched perfectly. A union between them seemed inevitable.

Until Vivian Lockhart appeared out of nowhere...

"Ethan, you're even more striking than I remembered. Do you have any idea how much I've missed you? Every night, I dream of—"

From the moment she entered, Isabella's gaze never left Ethan. She clung to his arm, pouting. "How could you be so cruel? We grew up together, yet the moment you married, you cut me off completely. Unbelievable!"

Ethan's expression darkened. His sharp eyes scanned the room as he demanded coldly, "This was a private gathering. Who invited her?"

Silence fell over the guests.

Isabella's face burned with humiliation. "Really, Ethan? Am I some kind of monster you need to avoid at all costs?"

A spiteful smirk twisted her lips. "You act like a devoted husband, but your wife? Not so much. She puts on a virtuous act, but today, she proved what kind of woman she really is. If she hadn't confessed herself, I'd never have believed it. You deserve better, Ethan!"

Ethan's voice turned icy. "Confessed what?"

"Well..."

Isabella glanced around, feigning hesitation.

The guests took the hint and excused themselves swiftly.

Soon, only Ethan and Isabella remained in the vast hall.

Her pulse raced. This was the moment she'd waited for. She longed to throw herself into his arms. "Ethan, finally, we're alone. I—"

"Five minutes."

His tone was frigid, impatient.

It wasn't personal. He simply disliked excessive physical contact, especially from clingy women like Isabella.

Rage bubbled inside her, but she forced calm.

Because soon, his attitude would change completely.

"Ethan, watch this. It'll explain everything."

She pulled out her phone and played the recorded video.

Vivian's face filled the screen.

Ethan's gaze turned glacial as he watched.

In the footage, Vivian spoke clearly: "If you convince your father to sign with Lockhart Enterprises, I'll agree to divorce Ethan and disappear from his life forever."

Isabella studied his reaction, then added sweetly, "Honestly, I don't understand her. I merely suggested helping, and she jumped at the chance to film this. She didn't spare a single thought for your feelings. It just proves how desperately she loves Liam Osborne—she'd go this far for him!"

Ethan remained silent, his face unreadable.

Isabella pressed on. "But she's a fool. I'd never actually help her. If I were to influence my father, it would only be to strengthen ties with Blackwood Group. Why would I let her benefit?"

Her voice dripped with malice. "And because I couldn't stand her betraying you, I taught her a little lesson. Right now, she's probably trembling with regret!"

Ethan's eyes flashed dangerously. "What did you do?"
###Chapter 86

Skyview Retreat

The primeval forest was lush and vibrant during daylight hours—a natural sanctuary where Newport City's elite came to unwind. But when night fell, it transformed into a treacherous playground for predators.

At its heart lay a concealed bunker, its entrance choked with twisting vines and thorns. Few ventured here. Tonight, an eerie blue glow pulsed from within, like spectral flames dancing in the darkness.

Vivian Lockhart sat motionless at the bottom of the pit. The damp air reeked of mildew, and the occasional scuttle of rodents echoed around her. Her delicate features remained impassive.

Pathetic.

That fool Isabella Thornton actually believed trapping Vivian in this abandoned shelter would break her.

But Vivian had been trained in survival by her grandfather since childhood. What would terrify most was nothing to her.

She could escape a hundred different ways.

Yet she stayed.

Not only that—she deliberately made herself look like a wreck, as if clinging to life by a thread.

Vivian struck a stone against the ground, sparking a small fire. In its flickering light, she etched numbers into the wall with another rock.

"10, 9, 8, 7..."

She counted silently.

According to her calculations, Liam should be arriving soon with Leonard Kingsley's men.

Vivian mussed her hair further, then smeared dirt across her cheeks for effect.

Right on cue, the roar of an SUV engine cut through the night, growing louder.

She doused the flames and collapsed dramatically onto the cold floor.

A metallic bang shattered the silence as the bunker door was forced open.

Moonlight spilled in, illuminating a tall figure dropping down. Vivian drew a breath, ready to deliver a heart-wrenching plea for help—

Then froze.

"Vivian. Are you hurt?"

That voice—cold, sharp, unmistakable—sent a jolt through her.

Nathaniel?!

What the hell was he doing here?

Her mind raced. This wasn’t part of the plan. How was she supposed to keep up the act now?

Nathaniel’s large hands gripped her shoulders, his gaze scanning her under the pale light. When he found no injuries, the tension in his jaw eased slightly.

"Isabella has crossed a line. This ends now."

Moonlight carved his sharp features into something ethereal. Vivian caught herself staring, mesmerized.

She shook it off.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm fine. Liam will be here any minute. You should go."

She pulled away, putting polite distance between them.

This close quarters was inappropriate for a soon-to-be-divorced couple.

More importantly—Liam was supposed to arrive with Leonard’s men. She had a performance to deliver.

If Nathaniel stayed—or worse, took her away—the entire plan would collapse.

"That worthless pretty boy again."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. He caught her chin, forcing her to meet his piercing gaze.

"Explain something to me. What spell has Liam Osborne cast on you?"

Vivian forced a sweet smile.

"Well... he’s handsome? My type, I suppose."

A flimsy excuse, but she needed him gone.

"So leave. Let him play the hero. You’re just the ex-husband—no need to interfere."

Nathaniel’s grip tightened.

Handsome?

He was widely considered Newport City’s most eligible bachelor. How could some influencer-faced pretty boy compare?

"Enough."

Done arguing, he scooped her up without warning.

Vivian tensed to protest—then went rigid.

A primal warning shot through her.

"Nathaniel—don’t move!" she hissed.
###Chapter 87

Ethan Blackwood thought Vivian Lockhart was playing games with him, so he dismissed her warning entirely.

A searing pain shot through his ankle without warning.

His gaze dropped to see a thick black snake with a crimson forked tongue, its beady eyes locked onto him. The serpent's girth matched two fingers pressed together.

"Damn it!"

Ethan's jaw clenched as numbness spread through his calf muscles. His legs threatened to buckle beneath him.

In one swift motion, he shoved Vivian behind his back. "I'll distract it. Run when you get the chance!"

"Did it bite you?"

Vivian's fists tightened. Her voice turned urgent. "That silver-ringed viper lives in damp caves. Its venom is lethal. Stop moving before it spreads!"

"Quiet if you want to live!"

Her loud warnings were making his temples throb.

All she was doing was provoking the creature.

Snake handling wasn't his expertise, but hesitation meant death. He had to act now.

Ethan angled his phone toward Vivian without turning. "On three, sprint like hell."

Vivian exhaled sharply. "Just wait. It'll leave soon."

Experience told her this species wasn't inherently aggressive. With poor eyesight, it only struck at movement. Staying still was their safest bet.

Once the snake deemed them harmless, it would slither away.

But Nathaniel Blackwood never took orders.

"One. Two. Three—GO!"

His phone's flashlight flickered wildly as he waved it at the snake, creating a diversion.

Vivian facepalmed. "Oh for god's sake—"

The viper struck like lightning, fangs bared in rapid succession.

"Move!"

She yanked Ethan sideways just as silver flashed through the air. A dart embedded itself in the snake's neck, slicing it clean in half.

Ethan's vision blurred. His head swam violently.

Vivian calmly collected both snake segments into a pouch for antivenom extraction. "You need a hospital. Now."

Ethan staggered toward her, pupils dilated. His towering frame caged her against the wall.

"Need... you." His voice dropped to a growl.

Vivian froze. "Nathaniel? What's wrong with you?"

The silver-ringed viper's venom wasn't just neurotoxic—it induced hallucinations and... other effects.

And emotional turmoil amplified the symptoms.

"That pretty boy Liam?" Ethan's thumb brushed her lower lip. "What does he have that I don't? Youth?"

Rationality had left the building.

He crushed his mouth against hers with possessive fury.
###Chapter 88

His lips burned against mine like molten lava.

Vivian's thoughts short-circuited. Her body surrendered completely, as if paralyzed by his touch.

This wasn't their first kiss, but never had Nathaniel been so... consuming.

So overwhelming that she found herself drowning in the sensation, helpless but to respond.

When she dared peek through her lashes, his sculpted features took her breath away.

Nathaniel's eyes were shut tight. Those long dark lashes, the sharp aristocratic nose, the perfect jawline - his face was lethal perfection.

Four years ago, this face had bewitched her.

Four years later, she still couldn't resist its power.

"Ahem!"

An awkward cough shattered the moment.

"Boss, you done making out? We've been standing here forever."

Liam's voice held a distinct note of disappointment.

"Shit!"

Vivian jerked back in panic, shoving Nathaniel away with too much force.

The venom had spread rapidly through Nathaniel's system. He collapsed like a felled tree.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

Reginald rushed forward, horror twisting his features. The implications were clear - if anything happened to the Blackwood Group CEO because of Miss Lockhart...

"He's been snakebit. Hospital. Now!"

All pretense forgotten, Vivian's only concern was Nathaniel's survival.

At Stanford Medical Center:

Thanks to quick treatment and antivenom, Nathaniel stabilized though remained unconscious.

"Thank God."

Vivian slid down the corridor wall, exhaustion hitting her.

Liam studied her with uncharacteristic solemnity. "Boss, shouldn't you be more worried about yourself? That's your almost-ex-husband in there."

"I know what I'm doing." Her voice was steel. "He saved me. I don't owe him anything."

Even if the idiot had provoked the snake trying to play hero...

"You're lying to yourself." Liam crossed his arms. "Was that life-saving CPR too? Because damn, boss - the man was poisoned and you were eating his face."

"Brat!" Vivian's palm connected with his head, her cheeks flaming.

The memory burned - how she'd devoured Nathaniel like a starving woman. Shameful.

Liam's teasing faded. "You're still in love with him. Why not tell him the truth?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" She shot him a warning glare. "That was... temporary insanity. His stupid handsome face. Won't happen again."

"Won't it?" Liam's smirk said he knew better.

Footsteps echoed down the hall, interrupting them.
###Chapter 89

The man striding down the hospital corridor was Leonard Kingsley himself - the very person Vivian Lockhart had been waiting for all night.

"Ms. Lockhart, my foolish daughter has crossed every line this time." Leonard's voice carried genuine remorse as he adjusted his cufflinks. "She's been confined to her room for a month as punishment. I can only hope you'll find the grace to forgive her."

Vivian's gaze drifted toward Ethan Blackwood's private ward, her nails digging into her palms.

The doctors said he'd survive, but the black mamba venom still lingered in his system. No one could predict the long-term effects. The weight of responsibility pressed heavily on her shoulders.

If she hadn't staged that ridiculous performance to secure Kingsley Holdings' cooperation, Ethan wouldn't be lying unconscious now.

The opportunity to make her demand stood before her. Yet the words stuck in her throat.

Nathan Prescott had no such reservations. "If apologies fixed everything, we wouldn't need courts," he said sharply, stepping forward. "You're a businessman, Mr. Kingsley. Do you really think pretty words compensate for what your daughter did?"

Leonard nodded solemnly. "I've considered this carefully. If you'll drop the matter, Ms. Lockhart, Kingsley Holdings will partner with whichever company you choose - Lockhart Enterprises or Blackwood Group."

"Now that's what I call a proper apology!" Nathan's eyes gleamed with triumph.

Everything was falling into place perfectly. His admiration for Vivian grew - it had taken her less than twenty-four hours to outmaneuver a seasoned fox like Leonard Kingsley.

"Since we're all here," Nathan pressed, producing a contract from his briefcase, "why don't we make it official?"

But Vivian shook her head. "We'll decide after my husband wakes."

Nathan whirled around, mouthing silent protests. After coming this far, at the final moment she wanted to stop? Had she lost her mind?

Vivian ignored his frantic gestures.

She knew exactly what she was doing.

Passing up Kingsley Holdings meant forfeiting Lockhart Enterprises' chance to dominate the market overnight.

But she couldn't do it. Not like this. Not until Ethan opened his eyes.

Leonard's sharp gaze flickered between them, trying to decipher their relationship. Not lovers, certainly. Yet something more than colleagues. Then at Ethan lying motionless behind glass...

What a complicated triangle.

"Very well," Leonard conceded. "The offer stands whenever you're ready, Ms. Lockhart." With a curt nod, he departed.

Nathan bit back his frustration. Vivian always had her reasons. Lockhart Enterprises was hers to command - he was merely an employee following orders.

Business called him away, leaving Vivian alone in the sterile hallway.

The head physician arrived with test results, adjusting his glasses nervously. "Mrs. Blackwood, while your husband's life isn't in danger, the mamba venom requires several days to fully purge from his system."

He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "During this period... Mr. Blackwood may exhibit some unusual symptoms. I thought you should be prepared..."
###Chapter 90

Vivian's brow furrowed as she anxiously asked the physician, "Tell me the truth."

"The snake's venom is highly potent and affects the central nervous system. Mr. Blackwood may experience temporary quadriplegia in the coming days." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Meaning he won't have mobility. Don't be alarmed - it's not permanent. Once the venom clears his system, full function will return."

"Quadriplegia?"

Before Vivian could process the term, a crash echoed from the hospital room.

"Out! All of you! Don't you dare lay a hand on me!"

Nathaniel's roar carried through the entire corridor. Vivian and the doctor rushed toward the commotion.

A cluster of young nurses huddled outside the door, too terrified to enter.

"What's the meaning of this?" The doctor's voice turned stern. "The patient's awake. Why aren't you attending to him? Do you value your jobs?"

The head nurse trembled. "Director, Mr. Blackwood threatened anyone who touches him. We didn't want to provoke him further."

Vivian pushed past them. "I'll handle this."

The moment she entered, Nathaniel bellowed, "Are you deaf? I said get out!"

Only when she reached his bedside did recognition flash in his eyes. "You."

His glare softened marginally, but fury still radiated from him. "You leave too."

Since regaining consciousness, he'd discovered his body refused to obey him - not even a finger would twitch. The proud Nathaniel Blackwood couldn't bear witnesses to this humiliation.

Vivian didn't retreat. Instead, she dragged a chair beside his bed, studying him like a rare specimen. The mighty tycoon who always dominated others now lay helpless. The irony held a strange charm - like a declawed lion roaring impotently.

"Those nurses were just doing their jobs," she chided. "Must you terrorize them?"

His jaw clenched. "They stripped me. Touched me without consent. They're lucky I can't move."

Vivian suppressed a smile, adopting a maternal tone. "You're a patient. Cooperation is expected. They were administering medication."

She added mischievously, "Besides, it's not like your perfect physique suffered damage from their examination. Why the fuss?"

Nathaniel's glare could have melted steel.

Message received. Vivian mimed zipping her lips. Pushing him further might be hazardous to her health.

After a long silence, his voice emerged strained. "I'm paralyzed, aren't I?"
###Chapter 91

Vivian struggled to suppress her laughter at Ethan's devastated expression.

Karma's a bitch. The mighty Nathaniel Blackwood, reduced to this pitiful state. She'd savor every second of his humiliation.

She schooled her features into false sympathy. "Accidents happen. Life's unpredictable like that."

"Leave." Ethan's voice was hollow as he turned away. "I need to be alone."

"Not happening." Vivian crossed her arms. "You got hurt saving me. I'm staying."

"I said no!" His rejection was sharp as shattered glass.

"Positive?" She tilted her head, feigning concern.

"Get. Out." Each word dripped with Arctic venom. "I won't repeat myself."

A relentless ringing pierced the tension. Ethan's phone vibrated insistently on the dashboard.

"Fine, Mr. Blackwood. I'll give you privacy." Vivian's saccharine smile didn't reach her eyes.

The ringing continued. Ethan's jaw clenched. "Bring me the damn phone."

"Pardon? Couldn't quite catch that." She cupped her ear dramatically.

"I. Need. That. Phone." He ground out through gritted teeth.

Victory tasted sweet. Vivian plucked the device from his jacket, holding it just beyond his reach. "See? Was that so hard? Pride won't feed the cat, darling."

Dominic Harrington's frantic voice burst through the speaker. "Sir! Your mother's called twelve times! Mr. Alfred's flight lands at eight - she insists you meet him personally!"

"Announce I'm vacationing abroad with my wife," Ethan snapped. "No public appearances."

"With Miss Lockhart? But you two-"

"End of discussion." Ethan's glare could've melted steel. Vivian obediently disconnected.

"Alfred's coming home tonight? How was his surgery?" Genuine concern crept into her voice. The old man was the only Hunt - no, Blackwood - she actually missed.

"Not your concern." Pain flickered behind Ethan's stoic mask.

Vivian's smirk faltered. Maybe she'd pushed too far. She opened her mouth to confess-

"You're my primary caretaker starting now." Ethan's commanding tone returned. "Name your price. Triple whatever Blackwood Legal pays you."

Typical. Even paralyzed, he thought money solved everything. "And if I refuse?"

The challenge hung between them like a drawn blade.
###Chapter 92

"You promised to share my burden. Running scared already?"

Nathaniel's lips curled in a mocking smirk. "Go ahead, leave. I'd rather die than live like this."

Vivian Lockhart never yielded to threats, but guilt trips were her weakness. Abandoning him now would haunt her forever.

"Fine, I'll take care of you. But only for the money!" she snapped.

This mess was his fault for saving her. She despised owing anyone. Walking away would be unforgivable.

Just a few days. It’d be over before she knew it.

"You’re doing this willingly. No one forced you."

Nathaniel’s arrogance made her fists clench.

"Absolutely. I’m bored and love being yelled at. Thrilled to be your personal servant. Happy?"

She rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath, "Pompous ass."

True to his capitalist nature, Nathaniel wasted no time exploiting her.

"I’m thirsty. Fetch me water."

"Remember—36°C exactly. Not a degree higher or lower."

"You—!"

Vivian’s knuckles whitened. The urge to punch him was overwhelming.

As she stormed off, cursing him, Nathaniel’s lips twitched into a sly fox-like grin.

The doctor and nurses entered moments later.

"How are you feeling, Mr. Blackwood?" the doctor asked cautiously.

"Figure it out yourself. Stop wasting my time."

Nathaniel’s icy tone left the doctor flustered.

"Apologies, Mr. Blackwood. We’ve done all we can. The venom’s effects are temporary but... uncomfortable."

Seeing the truth about to spill, Vivian cut in dramatically.

"I’ll care for my husband! Even if he never walks again, I’ll be his hands, his feet, his everything!"

The doctor blinked.

Paralysis was temporary. Why the theatrics?

Ah, married life. Outsiders wouldn’t understand.

"Your devotion is touching, Mrs. Blackwood. We’ll leave his care to you."

He turned to the nurses. "Since Mr. Blackwood values privacy, Mrs. Blackwood will handle his medication and hygiene. Train her."

"Medication? Hygiene?" Vivian paled. "What exactly does that entail?"

A nurse smiled gently. "Don’t worry. It’s simple—"

"The venom requires topical treatment. You’ll need to apply ointment... everywhere. Three times daily."

Vivian’s soul left her body.

Rub medicine all over him? Impossible!

Nathaniel, silent until now, finally spoke.

"Then let’s begin."
###Chapter 93

"You mean... right this second?"

Vivian stared at the immobile man on the hospital bed, then at the medical staff with their practiced professional smiles. She felt utterly trapped.

"Obviously. Unless you'd prefer to wait until the venom reaches my heart and brain?" Ethan's icy tone left no room for argument.

"But this kind of intimate contact between a man and woman... It's not proper." Her cheeks burned at the thought.

She'd never even held Ethan's hand casually. Now she had to touch every inch of his body? The idea alone made her pulse race.

The doctor looked baffled. "Mrs. Blackwood, you're his wife. There's nothing improper about this."

"I'm not trained for this. My technique won't be professional."

"Just apply the ointment thoroughly over his entire body, then massage it in to help absorption." The doctor handed her freshly prepared medicine and gauze. "Hurry - the efficacy decreases when it cools."

Then they simply... left?!

Vivian stood frozen, back turned to Ethan, her face flaming. She couldn't bring herself to move.

Ethan's eyes gleamed with dark amusement as he studied her tense posture. "Why so nervous? Could it be... you actually like me?"

"Absolutely not!"

She whirled around, fists clenched. "I'm divorcing you, remember? Liking you is impossible."

One dark eyebrow arched. "Is that so?"

The sheer arrogance. She acted ten times prouder than he ever had.

"Of course!"

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm not nervous... just worried about losing control."

"Losing control?"

Ethan didn't know whether to laugh or rage. "Look at me. How exactly could I lose control? You think I'll assault you through telekinesis?"

"Do I seem that desperate to you?"

Vivian cleared her throat. "You misunderstand. I'm worried about me losing control, not you."

She gestured at his physique. "With a body like that? It'll be hard not to... enjoy myself while applying the medicine."

Ethan blinked.

She had a point. He'd underestimated her.

"Fair enough." His lips twitched. "After all, even while I was poisoned, you couldn't resist kissing me. Who knows what you'll do with full access to my body."

Scarlet heat flooded Vivian's face and neck.

He remembered that?!

"This is mortifying." She seized the opportunity. "See how shameless I am? You should get a nurse instead."

"No one's more qualified than my wife."

Though paralyzed, Ethan's commanding presence remained undiminished. "I'd rather be groped by you than some stranger. Now stop stalling - unless you're actually attracted to me?"

That challenge sparked her defiance.

"Fine! I'll do it!" She snatched up the medicated gauze. "Don't think I'm scared of you!"

With a deep breath, she pulled back the blanket and began unbuttoning his hospital gown.

His sculpted physique emerged inch by inch - not an ounce of fat, just pure muscle. The sight made her mouth go dry.

"Here goes nothing."

Her small hands descended like curious kittens, exploring his chest with barely restrained enthusiasm.

It felt... surprisingly pleasant.

The upper body was manageable. But when she reached his waistband, she had to turn away, working by touch alone.

Ethan's voice cut through the tension. "What exactly are you doing?"
###Chapter 94

"Oh my God, I'm so sorry!"

Vivian immediately pulled her hands away as if burned.

"It was an accident!"

She held up her palms in surrender, her cheeks flaming red.

Nathaniel remained perfectly composed. "Relax. It's not like I can feel anything anyway."

"Jesus Christ..."

Mortification washed over her in waves. This had to be the most embarrassing moment of her entire existence.

Right now, Vivian wished the floor would open up and swallow her whole. Maybe then she wouldn't have to face Nathaniel ever again.

She completely missed the subtle smirk playing on Nathaniel's lips.

As days passed, Vivian gradually adapted to her new routine.

After surviving that initial humiliation, she'd grown surprisingly comfortable handling Nathaniel's body.

Her reasoning was simple - if he couldn't physically feel her touch, why should she restrain herself?

So she explored every sculpted muscle without reservation.

Faced daily with such masculine perfection, no red-blooded woman could maintain complete professionalism.

Of course, nothing came free in this world. While she enjoyed unrestricted access to Nathaniel Blackwood's magnificent physique, he'd been making increasing demands.

Freshly ground coffee beans every morning.

Fruit cut into mathematically precise cubes.

Daily financial briefings read with broadcast-quality diction.

"Enough! I can't take this anymore!"

Midway through grinding today's coffee, Vivian snapped. This had to stop.

The rewards weren't worth serving this demon king.

A week had passed - surely he'd shown some improvement?

She yanked back the blanket and pinched Nathaniel's thigh. "Feel anything now?"

"What do you think?" His voice remained flat. "You're the one who declared me permanently paralyzed."

"Ugh!"

Vivian rubbed her temples anxiously.

Had her curse actually come true? Why wasn't he showing any signs of recovery?

"Having second thoughts?"

Nathaniel lowered his lashes, adopting a wounded expression. "I knew you'd give up eventually. Go ahead, leave. I don't blame you. Saving you was my choice."

His words tugged at her heartstrings.

Strangely, this single week together had brought them closer than four years of marriage. Forgotten emotions were resurfacing.

She bit her lip before asking the question burning in her chest. "So... do you regret saving me?"
###Chapter 95

The room froze into absolute stillness.

An unspoken tension crackled between them.

Ethan Blackwood's lips parted slightly, as if struggling to form words.

The moment shattered when the hospital door burst open.

"So this is your 'business trip abroad'?" Margaret Whitmore's voice dripped with venom as she stormed in. Her glare at Vivian could have melted steel.

Cassandra Delacroix followed close behind, her swollen belly protruding like a grotesque accusation.

That visible pregnancy hit Vivian like a physical blow, snapping her back to cruel reality.

How pathetic she'd been.

The cheating was undeniable fact. Yet she'd foolishly tested his feelings.

Did it even matter now whether he regretted saving her?

"Perfect timing. I can finally leave." Vivian rose gracefully, gesturing to the medicine bowl. "Three applications daily. This seems more your responsibility, Cassandra."

The other woman immediately donned her wounded dove act. "Thank you, Vivian. So kind of you to care for my Nathaniel these past days." Her saccharine tone barely concealed the taunt.

Vivian nearly laughed at the absurdity.

Without another word, she turned to leave.

"Stay." Ethan's command sliced through the room with imperial finality. "No one tends me better than you."

Cassandra's face twisted before she could school her features into pitiful dismay.

Margaret exploded. "Have you lost your mind? Cassandra carries your heir while this woman-" she jabbed a finger at Vivian "-is nearly your ex-wife!"

"Nearly being the operative word." Ethan's gaze never left Vivian. "Until then, wifely duties remain hers."

The tension thickened.

Margaret sputtered helplessly.

Vivian paused at the door, then turned with a razor-sharp smile. "You should know, Margaret - your son became quadriplegic saving me from a snakebite. He may never walk again."

She directed false sympathy at Cassandra. "Such hardship ahead for you both. But true love conquers all, no? I wish you joy in your... unique marriage."

Margaret swayed, clutching her chest.

Cassandra's reaction was priceless. "Lies!" She lunged, nails digging into Vivian's arm. "You're desperate to keep him!"

Vivian shook her off contemptuously. "Ask him yourself."

All eyes turned to Ethan, whose expression remained unreadable. "She speaks truth. Would you still wed a cripple?"
###Chapter 96

"One—"

Cassandra Delacroix's voice faltered with visible discomfort.

She adored Nathaniel Blackwood, but only when he was at his flawless best. The thought of him bedridden and helpless made her recoil. Marriage? Unthinkable.

Isabella Lockhart's jaw tightened at the reaction.

It stung to see someone treat her long-cherished treasure with such blatant disregard. Her protective instincts flared. "Miss Delacroix," she mocked, "I thought what you shared with Mr. Blackwood was true love? Why the hesitation?"

"Even paralyzed, Nathaniel remains extraordinary—his looks, his stature, his presence. If you won't have him, countless others would. He's Nathaniel Blackwood. You don't get to be selective."

Cassandra paled, stammering, "Th-that's not what I—"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable as he arched a brow. "It's fine. I understand."

Isabella shook her head, patting his shoulder with pity. "People are practical creatures."

'Cruel, yes,' she thought, 'but his love life's tragic. First love ran off with his brother, then he settled for this schemer who'd abandon him at the first sign of trouble.'

'Pathetic. Women flock to him, but how many would stay through hardship? Only I did.'

'Past tense. Never again.'

"You cursed witch!" Eleanor Whitmore snapped.

Having regained composure, the older woman lunged at Isabella with feral intensity. "You brought this upon us! My family knew no peace since Nathaniel married you!"

"First Sebastian, now Nathaniel—all your doing! I'll end you myself if it brings my family peace!"

She seized a crystal vase, aiming for Isabella's skull.

Isabella barely had time to react, raising her arms in defense—

But the shattering impact never came.

Instead, warmth enveloped her as Nathaniel intercepted, his grip halting Eleanor's wrist mid-swing. "Mother," his voice was Arctic, "put it down."

Eleanor's eyes bulged. Tears of relief spilled. "Nathaniel! You—you're standing!"

"Obviously." His tone could frost glass.

"Praise heaven! God wouldn't be so cruel to us. You terrified me!"

Cassandra's face transformed. Seeing Nathaniel whole, she burst into theatrical tears. "Darling, never scare me like that! Our baby kicked so violently from fright!"

Isabella shoved free from Nathaniel's hold with force.
###Chapter 97

"You played me!"

Vivian's icy glare cut through Ethan. The sting of betrayal burned deeper than she'd admit.

All those days of playing nurse flashed through her mind. Catering to his every whim, fretting over nonexistent symptoms.

She'd been a complete fool.

Her pride lay shattered at his feet.

"Am I your pet? Was this your idea of entertainment?"

Vivian's fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms. "Enjoy your little victory. I'm done."

She stormed out without a backward glance.

Truth be told, part of her rushed exit was pure guilt.

She'd just declared him permanently paralyzed moments ago.

Ethan Blackwood never forgot a slight. He'd make her pay tenfold if she stayed.

Ethan moved to follow, but Cassandra's hand clamped around his arm. "You're still recovering," she cooed. "Rest is what you need."

His glacial stare dropped to her restraining fingers. The unspoken threat made her recoil instantly.

"I'm just concerned," she backpedaled, biting her lip. "But... there's something you should know about Vivian."

Ethan's expression remained impassive. "Unless you're certain, keep it to yourself."

Recent events had peeled back Cassandra's carefully constructed facade. He saw her clearly now.

Eleanor Whitmore snapped, "Mind your tone! She's carrying our heir. Stress affects the baby."

Of course Eleanor recognized Cassandra's games. But that pregnancy guaranteed her protection.

If only Vivian's womb hadn't failed after four years. Useless girl brought nothing but misfortune.

Eleanor's temper flared. "Well? Out with it!"

Cassandra produced her phone with theatrical hesitation. "A paparazzo friend caught this. I convinced him not to publish, but you deserve the truth."

The image ignited a storm in Ethan's eyes.

There stood Vivian, exiting the obstetric wing with Liam Osborne. Their intimate posture screamed lovers.

"That scheming witch is pregnant?" Eleanor's voice trembled with conflicting emotions.

Vivian's mall declaration about carrying Osborne twins suddenly took on new meaning. This humiliation would stain the Blackwood name.

Cassandra rushed to clarify, "The doctors said otherwise—"

Ethan's phone vibrated with a security alert. Vivian's car had just left the estate gates.

His smile turned predatory.

The hunt was on.
###Chapter 98

"She's not pregnant?"

Margaret exhaled sharply, relieved her family's reputation remained intact.

"Then why was she seeing a gynecologist?"

Cassandra glanced nervously at Nathaniel before speaking in a carefully measured tone. "I shouldn't say more... I don't want to upset Mr. Blackwood."

Nathaniel's chiseled features hardened like marble. "Continue," he commanded icily.

"Very well... I'll tell you everything."

Cassandra hid her satisfaction at his reaction. "I didn't mention the photo immediately because I wanted proof. So I tracked down their doctor. He confirmed she isn't pregnant - though they were actively trying. They'd been prescribed fertility vitamins..."

She paused dramatically. "The doctor said conception would be difficult. If natural methods fail, they might consider IVF."

Every word was fabricated.

Cassandra had indeed located the physician, but he'd denied treating Vivian and Liam. Undeterred, she'd bribed another doctor to corroborate her story. Even if Nathaniel investigated, he'd hear the same lies.

"I knew it! That cursed woman is barren. Thank heavens you divorced her in time!"

Margaret gloated viciously. "Now the Osbornes will suffer. Imagine Theodore's rage when he learns his precious heir chose an infertile bride!"

Nathaniel remained silent, his expression stormy.

Margaret frowned. "Why that look? You should be celebrating! Don't tell me you actually care for her after that snakebite charade!"

Nathaniel's fists clenched, though his face betrayed nothing. "Never," he spat through gritted teeth.

Three days passed.

Vivian hadn't left her apartment since returning from the hospital. She'd expected Nathaniel to confront her about the deception, but he'd vanished completely - no calls, no texts.

Those tender days nursing him felt like another lifetime. Their fleeting closeness had evaporated. This silent separation seemed the natural conclusion.

Except for one unfinished matter.

Today was their divorce appointment.

Neither reached out first, each stubbornly waiting for the other to break the stalemate.

By midday, Vivian's patience snapped.

She texted Nathaniel: "Divorce today. What time?"

His reply came instantly: "30 minutes."

The curt response stung. After everything she'd done for him, this was his attitude?

But what had she expected? Four years couldn't thaw him - why would three days?

Grabbing her documents, Vivian hailed a cab to City Hall.

As she stepped onto the curb, Nathaniel's car pulled up simultaneously.
###Chapter 99

Nathaniel Blackwood looked just as striking as ever, despite their days apart. His tall frame carried the same effortless grace she remembered. Those long legs showed no signs of his recent injury - he'd healed perfectly.

Vivian Lockhart exhaled quietly. At least she wouldn't have to worry about any lingering complications.

If there had been permanent damage, she'd never hear the end of it. The divorce proceedings would become even more complicated.

She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and cleared her throat. They were still technically married - some civility was warranted. Better to end things amicably.

With what she hoped was a convincing smile, she raised her hand in greeting. "Hello."

His lips pressed into a thin line. Cold eyes swept past her without acknowledgment as he strode away, those ridiculous legs carrying him swiftly down the hall.

Just like that.

Her smile froze.

Anger prickled beneath her skin. The nerve of that man!

'Who does he think he is?' she fumed. 'I literally nursed him back to health. Couldn't he at least pretend to be civil?'

Vivian quickened her pace, following him toward the second-floor divorce department.

The line for divorces stretched just as long as before. In stark contrast, only a handful of couples stood at the marriage registration counter.

A bittersweet pang hit her. People were finally waking up. The institution of marriage was becoming obsolete.

Nathaniel bypassed the queue entirely - perks of being Nathaniel Blackwood. The staff practically tripped over themselves to accommodate him.

Documents were processed with alarming efficiency. They were offered drinks while they waited.

Now they sat side by side in suffocating silence. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Vivian sipped her water, emotions churning. This was it. Soon, she'd hold the paper that severed their connection completely.

If they both played their cards right, they might never cross paths again. Just like these past few days - two strangers moving through separate worlds.

She'd made peace with this. Or so she'd thought.

But thinking of the twins growing inside her sent fresh grief crashing through her chest. They'd never know their father.

Would they resent her for this choice someday?

"You should tell him," a voice whispered.

"Co-parenting could work."

"But would he even believe me now? He'd think I'm trying to trap him."

"He has Cassandra now. Her child is the one he actually wants."

Her grip tightened on the cup until the paper crumpled.

"Planning to remarry?"

Nathaniel's icy voice shattered her thoughts.

She choked on her water. "Excuse me?"

His expression remained unreadable. "Julian Montgomery. Are you marrying him?"

Vivian's eyes widened. "Why do you care?"

He studied her for a long moment before speaking slowly. "As your ex-husband, it's none of my concern. But consider this a courtesy warning - Julian isn't right for you."

Was that genuine concern or another dig? She couldn't tell.

"Then are you marrying Cassandra?" she fired back.
###Chapter 100

The words left her lips before she could stop them. Instant regret flooded her veins.

What a foolish question. The answer was painfully obvious.

"I should remind you too," Vivian pressed on stubbornly, clutching at her crumbling dignity. "Cassandra isn't right for you. Forget her questionable character - the moment she heard you might be paralyzed forever, her disgust was written all over her face. She's the type who only wants the perfect version of you, not the real man beneath the surface."

Nathaniel's response came calm and measured. "Her feelings don't matter. I only care about my child's safety and happiness."

"Mr. Blackwood, how noble. Now that's what I call true love."

The words cut deeper than she'd expected. Humiliation burned through her, making her wish the ground would swallow her whole.

So this was his devotion? Loving Cassandra enough to accept her conditional affection, so long as their child was protected?

A bitter realization struck her. Thank God she hadn't told him about her own pregnancy. That would have been the ultimate humiliation.

Children born from love were treasures. Those conceived in passion? Mere burdens.

And who wanted burdens?

The clerk signaled their turn. They signed mechanically, posed for the obligatory photo, and watched the official stamp seal their divorce.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Lockhart, the process is complete. You're now legally divorced. Please keep your certificates safe."

Vivian accepted the document, studying it intently.

The infamous divorce papers had a red cover, duller than marriage certificates. Where couples once smiled together, now only solitary portraits remained.

She remembered reading something poetic on another divorce certificate: 'Marriage is precious, but when differences arise, part with kindness, not bitterness.'

"Goodbye." Her wave felt strangely light.

Finally, it was over. Four years of marriage - both blessing and curse.

She'd loved. She'd hated. But she'd never regretted meeting him or being his wife.

Now she only hoped they could let go of the hatred and part with grace.

Her phone rang the moment she stepped outside city hall. Alfred Blackwood's cheerful voice filled her ear.

"Viv, I heard you and Nate are back from your trip! My recovery's going well. Come have dinner with me tonight - I've missed you both terribly."

Her throat tightened at his warmth.

He'd treated her like family all these years, his affection never wavering. Now the divorce meant severing that bond too. She hadn't even said a proper goodbye.

After a pause, she forced brightness into her voice. "Of course, Grandpa. I'll be there soon."

To maintain the charade, she stopped at an upscale grocery store for imported delicacies.

Blackwood Estate loomed ahead, its grandeur unchanged.

"Young Miss! Mr. Alfred's in his study waiting for you. Go right up!"

Unlike the cold staff at Blackwood Villa, the main estate's servants remained warm and welcoming - all because of Alfred's influence.

Vivian walked the familiar hallway to his study.

The old man looked up from his writing with a smile. "Viv, come here. I have something for you."
###Chapter 101

Alfred Blackwood set down the fountain pen and reached into his desk drawer as he spoke to Vivian.

With great ceremony, he withdrew an ornate rosewood box and presented it to her.

"Isabella, open it."

Vivian accepted the box with trembling fingers. Inside lay a gleaming medal embossed with both a peace dove and crossed swords. She turned questioning eyes to the elder Blackwood. "Grandfather, what is this?"

"Your grandfather Arthur entrusted this to me before his passing. It represented his life's work and ideals. Now, it belongs to you."

Alfred sighed, remembering his dear friend's extraordinary legacy. "Arthur worried endlessly about you in his final days. He made me promise to give you this medal after four years of marriage to Nathaniel."

"This marks your fourth anniversary. Consider it his blessing for your union. May it bring you both lasting happiness."

Tears blurred Vivian's vision as she traced the engraved surface. For a fleeting moment, she could almost feel Arthur's calloused yet tender hand guiding hers.

"Grandfather always protected me. Even now, his spirit watches over me. I've been such a disappointment—always causing him grief..."

Memories flooded back—Arthur's final plea for her to abandon dangerous ambitions, to live simply as Mrs. Blackwood rather than reclaim the Lockhart dynasty. His dying wish had been for her to find contentment in domestic life.

'And yet here I am...' Vivian bit her lip. She'd failed even this basic request.

Some battles could be won through sheer will. But love? That remained beyond her control. She'd fought valiantly, but facing Nathaniel's indifference, retreat became her only option.

"Nonsense, child!" Alfred chided gently. "To us, you're extraordinary. Why, taming my stubborn grandson proves you possess qualities no other woman could match."

Vivian coughed awkwardly, avoiding his gaze. If Alfred discovered their divorce papers, his heart might not withstand the shock.

"Actually, Grandfather, Nathaniel and I brought gifts from our trip." She quickly changed subjects.

"How thoughtful! Show me at once."

Vivian produced carefully selected souvenirs. "Santorini's finest coffee beans, herbal teas, and this—" She revealed a velvet case containing a luminous black pearl. "Harvested from Bali's deepest waters. Centuries in the making, they say it carries healing energies for its keeper."

The pearl had cost a small fortune—her final tribute to the man who'd shown her more kindness than his grandson ever had.

"Magnificent!" Alfred beamed, admiring the iridescent sphere. His granddaughter-in-law's exquisite taste never failed to impress.

"Grandfather."

Nathaniel's baritone voice cut through the moment. Vivian turned slowly, meeting her ex-husband's icy gaze across the threshold.
###Chapter 102

The moment Vivian and Nathaniel stepped out of Newport City Courthouse, they parted ways without a backward glance—as if this was truly the end.

Little did they know fate had other plans.

Without the weight of their marriage certificate between them, something in their gazes had shifted. A tension neither could name.

Alfred Blackwood's sharp eyes darted between them, his expression unreadable.

"Young lovebirds," he mused, voice laced with skepticism. "Fresh from a romantic getaway, yet you visit me separately? Did you quarrel?"

Vivian bit her lip, torn between honesty and deception. Before the divorce, lying had been effortless. Now, the words stuck in her throat.

Nathaniel's arm slid around her shoulders, his touch practiced. "We're happier than ever," he said smoothly, as if they'd always been this affectionate.

Anyone watching would’ve believed it.

Vivian forced a smile, cheeks burning. "Of course we didn’t fight."

We just signed divorce papers.

Alfred hummed, unconvinced. He turned to Nathaniel. "Tell me, son. Where did you two escape to?"

Vivian opened her mouth, but Alfred raised a hand. "Let him answer."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on the coffee beans displayed nearby. "Colombia," he stated without hesitation.

Vivian nearly choked.

Colombia?!

Of all places—Santorini had been her dream. But him? Coffee plantations?

Alfred's pleasant demeanor vanished. "Colombia?" His voice turned glacial. "You expect me to believe that?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

"Kneel." The command cracked like a whip.

If Nathaniel's temper was a storm, Alfred's was a hurricane. A war hero’s fury wasn’t something to defy.

Vivian flinched, guilt twisting her stomach. She moved to kneel—but Alfred stopped her. "Not you, child." His glare fixed on Nathaniel. "You."

Without protest, Nathaniel dropped to his knees.

"Grandfather," he said, voice steady, "I accept my punishment."

Alfred exhaled sharply. "At least you admit fault." His piercing stare bore into them. "Now—what else are you hiding?"

Silence.

"Fine." Alfred's lips thinned. "Even if you won’t speak, I know. That pearl wasn’t just a gift, was it? It was a message."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

Vivian’s pulse spiked.

He knows.
###Chapter 103

"Hint?" Vivian blinked in confusion. She had gifted Alfred the black pearl purely wishing for his wellbeing. What hidden meaning could he possibly be seeing?

"The moment I saw this pearl, I immediately thought of its symbolism for fertility and childbirth—"

Alfred's expression darkened instantly. His cane struck the floor as he glared at Nathaniel kneeling before him. "You disgraceful boy. Tell me truthfully - are the rumors accurate? Did you actually impregnate another woman behind Vivian's back?"

Seeing no point in denial, Nathaniel straightened his spine despite his kneeling position. His voice came out icy and resolute. "Since you've already guessed, I won't lie. That child carries Blackwood blood. It deserves legitimacy and a father's name."

"You—!" Alfred clutched his chest, struggling to breathe. His cane came down hard on Nathaniel's back. "Foolish boy!"

"That child needs status and respect? What about Vivian? Have you considered her feelings even once? She's your wife! For years, hasn't she devoted herself completely to this family - to you and me?"

"You're supposed to be closest to her, yet you neither cherish nor love her. Fine. But how dare you betray her like this!"

Alfred's rage escalated with each word. With finality, he commanded, "I don't care what it takes. Get that woman to a hospital immediately and terminate that illegitimate child!"

"I will only recognize children born between you and Vivian. No others shall carry the Blackwood name!"

Nathaniel kept his head lowered but refused firmly. "I apologize, Grandfather. That I cannot do."

This final defiance shattered Alfred's composure. "So this is your decision? Defying me for some woman? Very well - you leave me no choice but to administer the family discipline!"

Alfred moved to the bookshelf, retrieving a long-unused leather whip. Without hesitation, he brought it down across Nathaniel's back.

"It's been years since this whip tasted blood. Today, I'll either beat sense into you or answer to Arthur in the afterlife!"

The former soldier wielded the whip with brutal precision. Each lash bit deep, the pain radiating to Nathaniel's bones.

Yet Nathaniel remained silent. Though his back split open under the assault, not a single groan escaped his clenched teeth. If this punishment could appease his grandfather's fury, he would endure it willingly.

Vivian made no move to interfere. At nearly 190cm tall, Nathaniel could surely withstand some lashes. It wouldn't kill him.

But she hadn't anticipated Alfred's severity.

After several strikes, Nathaniel's shirt hung in tatters, revealing bleeding wounds. Still, he begged no mercy, determined to protect Cassandra and their unborn child at all costs.

Watching her ex-husband's devotion to another woman only emphasized Vivian's own pathetic irrelevance.

Outside the study, Winston the butler fretted anxiously. Gathering courage, he called out, "Sir, please stop! Any more and you'll kill him!"

"With Master Sebastian already gone, if anything happens to young master, the Blackwood line ends with you!"

Alfred showed no mercy, striking harder. "Then let it end! Better than allowing such heartless blood to continue!"

After several more lashes, Alfred demanded again, "Will you repent? Will you make that woman abort your bastard child?"

Nathaniel answered with stony silence, his face pale with pain, forehead glistening with sweat.

Seeing Alfred raise the whip once more, Vivian rushed forward. "Grandfather, stop! This isn't his fault! I don't blame him!"

"Vivian, move aside!"

Alfred tried to pull back but the whip still grazed Vivian's arm, leaving an angry red welt.

Nathaniel immediately pulled her close, examining the injury with a frown. "Stay out of my affairs," he hissed coldly.

Just as Alfred began appreciating this shred of concern, a small red booklet tumbled from Vivian's pocket—
###Chapter 104

The room fell into stunned silence. All eyes locked onto the small crimson booklet lying on the floor.

"Damn it!"

Vivian immediately dropped to her knees, scrambling to conceal the evidence. But it was too late. The bold black letters spelling "DIVORCE CERTIFICATE" glared up at everyone.

The unspoken truth echoed louder than any words. Ethan and Vivian were no longer married.

"You...you two..." Alfred Blackwood clutched his chest, his face contorted in pain.

"Grandfather!"

Both Ethan and Vivian rushed forward simultaneously.

Alfred violently shook off Ethan's helping hand. "Don't call me that," he spat coldly. "You've made your choice clear. Grown man who won't listen to his elders. How dare you divorce Vivian behind my back? Trying to send me to an early grave?!"

"Since that's how you feel..." Alfred yanked open his desk drawer and pulled out an antique revolver. His voice trembled with emotion. "This gun saved my life during the war. Arthur Lockhart gifted it to me. Now I'll use it to apologize to him in the afterlife!"

Before anyone could react, he pressed the barrel against his temple, finger hovering over the trigger.

"Grandfather, stop!"

Vivian and Winston turned deathly pale, frozen in terror.

Ethan remained eerily calm. "Enough theatrics," he said flatly. "I made a mistake. Punish me however you want, but don't play these childish games. Grandmother's dramatics work on me. You? Not so much."

Having been raised by his grandparents, Ethan knew their manipulation tactics intimately.

"Childish games?" Alfred enunciated each word with military precision. "You have three days. First, end things with that woman and her bastard child. Second, remarry Vivian."

"Fail to comply, and you'll discover exactly how serious I can be."

This was no empty threat. A soldier's honor bound him to fulfill promises made to his sworn brother Arthur.

Four years ago, he'd vowed the Blackwoods would protect Vivian forever. Now Ethan had broken that sacred oath. The only fitting atonement was death.

"I refuse!"

Vivian spoke before Ethan could respond. "I initiated the divorce. Remarriage is out of the question."

"Stop protecting him, child." Alfred's voice softened. "I know how deeply you loved him. That scheming witch must have manipulated him into this. Don't worry - I'll make this right."

"Grandfather, the truth is..." Vivian clenched her fists, forcing steadiness into her voice. "Our marriage was never real. We're both pursuing happiness with others now. Please...just bless our separation."

Alfred reeled back as if struck. This devoted girl who'd adored Ethan since childhood - how could she have changed so completely? The betrayal cut deeper than any blade.

"Fine. Perhaps it's for the best." Alfred grasped Vivian's hands tenderly. "You'll always be my granddaughter. Visit whenever you wish. My home remains yours."

His expression hardened as he turned to Ethan. "As for you - three days kneeling in the ancestral hall. Reflect on your failures."

"Yes, Grandfather." Ethan accepted the punishment without protest. Yet an inexplicable bitterness coiled in his chest, sharp and unfamiliar.
###Chapter 105

The Blackwood ancestral hall held generations of family altars. Kneeling there was the harshest punishment the Blackwoods could inflict.

Ethan remained silent. His back bore fresh lash marks as he knelt on the cold marble, facing the rows of ancestral tablets.

"Have someone watch him." Alfred Blackwood's voice was steel. "Let’s see how long he lasts without food or water for three days."

Winston hesitated, eyeing Ethan’s bleeding wounds. "Sir, the whipping was severe. He won’t survive three days like this."

Alfred didn’t glance back. "He accepted his punishment. This was his mistake to bear."

"But—Mrs. Lockhart admitted she filed for divorce. She’s moved on. How is this his fault?"

"I don’t care!" Alfred’s tone was icy, his double standards glaring. "Vivian wouldn’t have left without reason. He must have failed her. Let him reflect."

"Cheating and impregnating another woman is unforgivable!"

Winston knew arguing was futile. If Ethan’s parents got involved, it would only escalate.

There was only one person who could intervene now—the former Mrs. Lockhart.

Dinner was unnervingly calm.

"Vivian, try the fish. I had the chef prepare it specially for you."

"Thank you, Grandfather." She forced a bite. The flavor was ash in her mouth.

"Steaming fish requires precision—"

Vivian barely listened.

How could Alfred sit here discussing cooking techniques while his grandson bled in the hall, starving and freezing?

When it was time to leave, she hesitated at the door, words trapped in her throat.

"Visit more often, child." Alfred smiled warmly.

"Grandfather, about Ethan—"

"Don’t." His gaze turned glacial. "He earned this. Pleading for him means joining him."

With that, he walked away.

Vivian stood in the cold, torn.

Then she steeled herself. They were divorced. His fate wasn’t her concern.

She hailed a taxi.

Winston rushed out, breathless. "Mrs. Lockhart, wait! If you leave, Master Blackwood will die!"

"We’re divorced. And I’m hardly the one to intervene. Try his next wife."

"You know Alfred despises her! His parents would make it worse. You’re the only one he’ll listen to!"

"His decisions are final. I can’t help."

The taxi arrived. As she reached for the door, Winston thrust a photo into her hands.

"Look at this. He’s barely conscious. If this continues, he won’t survive the night."

Against her will, Vivian’s chest tightened at the image.
###Chapter 106

"Tell me how I can assist."

Vivian Lockhart sighed, her expression helpless. "I already tried pleading for him earlier, but Grandfather Alfred stopped me before I could even finish. He gave me a warning—if I bring it up again, I'll be punished alongside him. There's truly nothing more I can do."

She believed she'd done enough as Ethan Blackwood's ex-wife. Why should she risk trouble for his sake? The realization struck her—her feelings for him weren't as deep as she'd thought.

Winston noticed Vivian's hesitation and seized the opportunity. "You don't need to beg for mercy. Just help him... discreetly."

"Discreetly?"

"Exactly. All you have to do is take care of him in secret. No one else can do it—Grandfather adores you. Even if you're caught, he won't punish you. But if any of us try, the consequences would be severe."

Without waiting for her response, Winston swiftly packed a box with medicine and a warm meal, pressing it into her hands.

"Mrs. Blackwood, Master Ethan's well-being now depends on you. On behalf of the family, I thank you."

"Isn't this... wrong?"

Vivian knew she should refuse, but her body betrayed her. Her fingers curled around the box as if moving on their own. Her legs carried her forward, following Winston toward the memorial chamber.

Actions, it seemed, spoke louder than words.

Night had fallen.

The Blackwood family memorial chamber stood separate from the main estate, a solemn structure reserved for remembrance. During the day, staff maintained its pristine condition, but at night, only two dim lights illuminated the cold, eerie space.

From a distance, Vivian spotted Ethan. He knelt in the center, posture rigid, his white shirt stained with blood—worse than Winston's earlier description.

"Stubborn fool," she muttered under her breath. "Does he think this is some dramatic film scene?"

Her fingers tightened around the box. Reluctantly, she admitted to herself—she was still worried.

Winston sighed. "Master Ethan has always been strong-willed. He respects Grandfather too much to defy him openly. This is his way of proving his determination... for that woman."

He glanced at the guard by the door, who promptly turned away, feigning interest in the night sky.

Vivian slipped inside unnoticed.

Ethan didn't turn at the sound of her footsteps. He remained motionless, his back straight despite his injuries. His lips were cracked, his face pale from exhaustion and dehydration.

She cleared her throat awkwardly.

"Leave." His voice was ice. "Outsiders aren't permitted here."

Vivian's temper flared. After all her effort, this was the thanks she got?

"I didn't come by choice," she snapped. "Winston said you were half-dead and begged me to help. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered. Ungrateful."

"What concern is my well-being to you?" His tone was cutting. "After all the trouble you went through to see me like this, why pretend to care now?"

"What?" Confusion flickered across her face. His words felt like bullets fired at random.

"Stop acting." Ethan's laugh was bitter. "You gave Grandfather that pearl as a hint about Briar's child. Then you 'accidentally' dropped our divorce papers. Clever."

Vivian's mouth opened, then closed. How could she explain? She hadn't known Grandfather would interpret the pearl that way. And the divorce papers—she'd kept them hidden.

"You moved on quickly, yet you're still playing the victim," he continued, his voice hoarse. "I underestimated you, Vivian."

Her jaw clenched. "Fine. I'm devious. Believe what you want."

She set the box beside him and turned to leave. They were divorced. Strangers. Whatever he thought of her no longer mattered.
###Chapter 107

"You're the most ungrateful man I've ever met. Completely paranoid!"

Vivian stormed out of the memorial chamber, her heels clicking angrily against the marble floor. She couldn't stop the furious words tumbling from her lips.

What was she thinking, trying to be kind to that impossible man? She was only making herself angrier. She could be soaking in her jacuzzi right now with a glass of wine, binge-watching her favorite show.

Winston had been waiting outside. Seeing Vivian emerge so quickly, he rushed forward. "Mrs. Lockhart? That was fast—"

"That insufferable man is using me and insulting me. Why should I stay?"

"Surely you're mistaken!"

Winston shamelessly pleaded, "You know Mr. Blackwood's temperament. He's stubborn and sharp-tongued but doesn't mean half of what he says. Please help him. Convince him to eat and treat his wounds, or he might not survive the night."

"Absolutely not!" Vivian clenched her jaw, her expression hardening. "He made it clear his life is none of my concern!"

"Oh no! Mr. Blackwood collapsed—" Winston cried out in panic. "Mrs. Lockhart, help! He'll die at this rate!"

Vivian squeezed her eyes shut, stomped her foot, and spun around. 'Ethan Blackwood, I must have owed you a life debt in my past existence!'

Ethan had indeed collapsed on the floor. His forehead glistened with sweat as he endured the pain from his lash wounds.

"Why did you come back? Get out!"

Even in this weakened state, Ethan's arrogance remained intact.

"Shut your mouth, you idiot!" Without another word, Vivian began stripping Ethan's shirt off.

His broad shoulders and perfectly sculpted back muscles were now visible. The whip marks across his golden skin gave him a dangerously alluring aura.

"Ahem!"

Vivian's mouth went dry at the sight. She swallowed hard and cleared her throat, trying to mask her racing heartbeat.

Though weakened, Ethan's sharp eyes missed nothing. He easily detected Vivian's attraction. "Woman. You couldn't keep your hands off me last time. Trying to take advantage again?" His voice was icy.

"What nonsense! You're utterly delusional!"

Flustered, Vivian accidentally poured too much ointment onto his wounds.

Ethan grimaced in pain, sweat dripping down his temples. Then a cooling sensation spread through his wounds, gradually easing the agony. The burning pain subsided noticeably.

Vivian continued treating his injuries, her touch gentler now. Ethan's tense expression slowly relaxed.

Her slender fingers moved with feather-light precision across his back. Each stroke sent tingling waves straight to his core.

"Remarkable! Mr. Blackwood never behaves this docilely, but Mrs. Lockhart always knows how to handle him!"

Winston, peeking through the chamber door, whispered to himself in awe.

In their four years of marriage, this was the first time he'd witnessed such harmony between them. The rare moment moved him to tears.

Suddenly, Winston felt an oppressive presence behind him. He turned and nearly had a heart attack.

"M-Master Alfred—"

"What are you doing skulking about at this hour?" The elder Blackwood's voice was stern.

"Sir, it's not what you think! Mrs. Lockhart, she—" Winston stammered nervously.

Alfred glanced away. "I don't know what you're babbling about, but I saw nothing."

With that, the old man walked away as if nothing had occurred—though he couldn't suppress the knowing smile tugging at his lips.

Winston suddenly understood.

'Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!' The butler marveled at the patriarch's tactics. Truly, with age came wisdom!
###Chapter 108

The days passed swiftly as Vivian settled into her newfound independence. Work consumed her daylight hours, but nights belonged to unrestrained joy and liberation. This single life suited her perfectly.

Today marked a milestone - the signing of a new contract with Kingsley Holdings for the upcoming fiscal year.

Leonard Kingsley had agreed to Vivian's bold request: a 500 million investment into Lockhart Enterprises as R&D funding. But the terms were razor-sharp. Lockhart Enterprises had to guarantee first-year profits exceeding 8 billion, or surrender 30% equity to Kingsley Holdings as compensation.

Liam's temper flared instantly.

"That sly fox Leonard! After all his supposed help for his daughter's sake, I expected at least basic decency. This contract is nothing but traps. His intentions couldn't be clearer!"

His confused gaze burned into Vivian. If possible, he'd tear the agreement to shreds. "Boss, this is downright humiliating. Why sign? We could raise 500 million ourselves. Is he mocking us?"

Vivian remained unshaken, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. "If we lose, thirty percent equity. If we win? Five years of continuous investment, minimum 1.5 billion annually. That's more than fair."

"Fair?!" Liam nearly choked. "Lockhart Enterprises is still in its infancy! We don't even have market-ready products yet. Eight billion profit in tech? That's insanity!"

He massaged his temples, stress lines deepening. "The world's top three tech firms average fifteen billion annually. For a startup like ours, eight hundred million would be miraculous. How can we possibly win? We're handing Kingsley Holdings our equity on a silver platter!"

Vivian arched one perfect eyebrow, confidence radiating. "When have I ever lost a bet?"

To others, such bravado might seem arrogant. But on Vivian, it fit like a second skin. Her dazzling self-assurance captivated Liam completely.

"Right. You're my boss. The legal sharks still beg for your counsel. After years of lying low, I almost forgot who you really are. You never lose!"

Liam had worshipped Vivian for years. Then he added with a smirk, "Except for your marriage to Nathaniel, of course."

Vivian's eye twitched. Must he always bring that up?

Annoying as he was, Liam wasn't wrong. Vivian's life had been an unbroken chain of victories - until Nathaniel Blackwood entered it. That particular defeat still stung.

"Regardless, our partnership with Kingsley Holdings will devastate Blackwood Group. I can practically see the Ice King's face turning purple..."

Liam couldn't suppress his glee, imagining Nathaniel's reaction. "Wait until he discovers his despised ex-wife is the mastermind behind Lockhart Enterprises. That explosion will be legendary!"

Meanwhile, tension choked the executive office at Blackwood Group.

Ethan Young stared at the mountain of documents beside Nathaniel, hands trembling. "Mr. Blackwood, we never anticipated Mrs. Blackwood would... She always seemed so gentle... This is... shocking!"
###Chapter 109

"Kind?"

Nathaniel Blackwood idly shuffled through the stack of files. His lips twisted into a chilling smirk. "Did you misjudge her true nature?"

"Misjudge?"

Ethan Young gulped, his throat tight. "For years, Mrs. Lockhart has been nothing but devoted to you," he dared to argue. "She played the perfect wife at home and maintained an impeccable public image. A model of grace and loyalty. As for her sudden shift in behavior... I believe the blame falls on you, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Me?"

"Absolutely!"

Ethan couldn't stop himself from defending Vivian, even if it cost him his job. "You've been cold and indifferent to her for years. Worse, you betrayed her. If you hadn't broken her heart, why would she have turned to a playboy like Julian Montgomery? She wouldn't have built Lockhart Enterprises with him just to rival Blackwood Group—"

"I've always known Mrs. Lockhart was exceptional. A prodigy who skipped grades, a genius in physics and engineering. She abandoned her career for you because she loved you. And what did you do? You threw her away, letting that worthless playboy Julian take what was yours. What a waste!"

Ethan thought of all the clients Blackwood Group had lost to Lockhart Enterprises. Even Kingsley Holdings, a long-standing partner, had switched sides.

Then it hit him. Lockhart Enterprises wasn’t just some vanity project for Julian. At this rate, they could soon rival Blackwood Group in the tech industry.

"Honestly, I’m more impressed by Julian than by Mrs. Lockhart’s transformation. A notorious womanizer, linked to countless socialites and actresses—yet he gave it all up for her. Handed over Lockhart Enterprises without hesitation. Now that’s love."

Ethan cleared his throat, deliberately provoking Nathaniel further. "If you keep this up, I wouldn’t be surprised if she walks away for good."

Nathaniel’s expression turned glacial. He shot Ethan a warning glare. "True love?"

A controlling stake in some small company? Nathaniel could’ve tossed her a dozen of those without blinking.

But thinking about it now—Vivian’s desperation to secure Kingsley Holdings had nothing to do with Julian. It was all for her own ambitions. Julian was just a means to an end.

Strangely, that thought lightened his mood.

"Anyway," Ethan switched to business, "the Global Tech Summit is in Harborview City in three days. Major players and industry leaders will be there. QuantumTech, our core chip supplier, is attending. Blackwood Group has dominated the tech sector with a 75% market share for five years straight. Your presence is mandatory."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Of course. It’s been a while since I’ve seen him."

Later, at The Velvet Room.

Vivian trudged to the fourth floor, barely interested, searching for the most extravagant private suite.

She’d finally closed the deal between Lockhart Enterprises and Kingsley Holdings. A hard-won victory, and the team insisted on celebrating. Sophia had promised her a surprise.

"Viv, I’ve got something special for you. Custom-made. You’ll love it!" Sophia’s voice had been giddy over the phone.

"Stop. You’re definitely scheming again."

Pushing open the door, Vivian froze at the sight before her—
###Chapter 110

Vivian pushed open the door and froze.

A lineup of impeccably dressed, devastatingly attractive men stood waiting for her.

Their expressions varied as they noticed her entrance. Some radiated charm, others innocence. A few carried an air of brooding intensity that sent shivers down her spine.

"What in the world—"

Her throat went dry. This felt like walking straight into a lion's den.

Sophia's voice crackled with excitement through the phone. "Viv! You're here! Check out my surprise gift—aren't they absolute eye candy?"

Vivian remained rooted to the spot. "Sophia, what fresh hell is this?"

"Remember your drunken rant at The Starlight Lounge after your divorce? How Nathaniel was replaceable? How you could have any man you wanted?"

A dramatic pause.

"Well darling, we pooled our resources to gather Newport City's finest specimens. Even got my brother out of town so you can play undisturbed. Best friends forever, right? You're welcome!"

"Sophia, this is outrageous!" Vivian's cheeks burned, then she quickly added, "And completely irresistible. My self-control is hanging by a thread—"

Her gaze swept across the room as she spoke.

Each man was more striking than the last. Sophia knew her tastes frighteningly well. Vivian's pulse quickened.

"Gotta go!" She ended the call abruptly, already stepping forward.

"Miss Lockhart!"

A boyish face approached—early twenties with sun-kissed hair and dimples. "We've prepared refreshments. Please, make yourself comfortable."

Vivian studied him. "Have we met before?"

The same nagging familiarity applied to several others in the room.

"Call me handsome, call me baby—just not 'young man,'" he pouted adorably. "Or they'll never let me hear the end of it!"

His puppy-dog expression triggered her maternal instincts. "Of course... young man."

The room erupted in laughter.

Unfazed, he explained, "We're Nova Boys from Hevlon Entertainment. Just debuted after that survival show? Probably saw our subway ads."

Recognition dawned. The luxury watch campaign featuring six stunning men—SK Group, now renamed.

Her eyes instinctively searched for one member in particular. There—in the corner. White shirt, black tie, engrossed in a handheld console.

While others buzzed with energy, he exuded quiet intensity. An island of calm in the storm.

"Julian!" her guide called.

The man looked up. Hazel eyes met hers under the warm lighting. That gaze—so familiar it stole her breath. Her heart stuttered dangerously.

"Excellent taste," her companion murmured. "Our center, the fans' favorite. Know what they call him?"
###Chapter 111

"No. What's his name?" Vivian asked, her voice slightly distant.

Though she was speaking to Marcus, her gaze remained fixed on the strikingly handsome, aloof man beside him.

In all her years, she'd only felt this kind of pull toward one other person.

"Julian's gorgeous, isn't he?" Marcus grinned. "From certain angles, he looks just like Nathaniel Blackwood—CEO of Blackwood Group. That's why his fans call him 'Little Nathaniel'—"

"Nathaniel Blackwood?" The name snapped Vivian back to reality. She clenched her jaw and quickly looked away.

Why did that man's name keep haunting her? It was like he was a ghost she couldn't escape!

Marcus, mistaking her reaction for ignorance, eagerly pulled out his phone. "You don't know what Nathaniel looks like? Here, I have a photo—see? Doesn't Julian resemble him?"

Vivian had no interest in looking. All she could think about was her rotten luck.

After finally meeting someone who made her pulse race post-divorce, he had to be her ex-husband's doppelgänger? What kind of cruel joke was this?

Julian, still engrossed in his game, barely spared her a glance. But he scoffed at their conversation. "Of course she knows Nathaniel. He's her husband."

The room fell into stunned silence.

"Wait—this gorgeous woman is Nathaniel Blackwood's wife?!" Marcus paled, immediately stepping back as if she were radioactive.

The other men reacted the same way, staring at Vivian like she was a walking disaster.

"Easy money? Yeah, right," one muttered. "Our agency told us to entertain clients, but no one said we'd be risking our lives with Blackwood's wife! I'm out!"

"Same here!"

In seconds, the room emptied as the men hastily grabbed their jackets and bolted.

Vivian scrambled to stop them. "Wait! There's no need to panic. My husband and I have an understanding—he does his thing, I do mine. No one's getting hurt!"

"Miss, you're amazing, but I value my life," one said, backing away. "Please pretend this never happened!"

With that, they fled as if the room were on fire.

Vivian groaned.

She and Nathaniel weren't publicly divorced yet, so to the world, they were still married. And no one dared cross Nathaniel Blackwood.

This wasn't the first time her identity had ruined a perfectly good night.

The once-lively room was now deserted—except for "Little Nathaniel," still lazily playing his game in the corner.

"Ugh, so boring." Vivian sighed, grabbing her purse to leave.

The man had made her heart skip, but the moment she heard his nickname, the magic vanished.

"Hold on." Julian suddenly paused his game, his sharp gaze locking onto her. "Are you really that desperate for male attention?"

Vivian blinked. "Excuse me?"

Julian stood, revealing his tall, lean frame. Now she understood why he was the group's visual—his presence was magnetic.

"Does your husband know you're out here chasing men?" he drawled, one brow arched.

"What business is it of yours?" Vivian snapped.

This man truly lived up to his nickname. Beyond the resemblance, his icy demeanor, arrogant smirk, and cutting words were identical to Nathaniel's.

This had to be karma.

"It is my business," Julian said coolly.

He stepped closer, his gaze as piercing as Nathaniel's ever was. "You paid for my time. Shouldn't I make sure you get what you came for?" A slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "So tell me—how do you want to play?"
###Chapter 112

Vivian's breath hitched as the words stuck in her throat.

Julian stood too close, his striking resemblance to Nathaniel making her pulse race. The proximity sent an unexpected thrill through her.

His piercing gaze held the same intensity as Nathaniel's, yet where Nathaniel's eyes burned with authority, Julian's carried the weight of untold stories.

A quiet sigh escaped Vivian's lips. Humans truly were creatures of habit.

Four years ago, she'd fallen instantly for Nathaniel. Now history repeated itself with his doppelgänger.

"Lost in thought?" Julian's murmur sent warm breath dancing across her skin. His voice flowed like aged whiskey, rich and intoxicating.

"Nothing important. I should leave." Vivian stepped back too quickly, her balance faltering.

Strong hands caught her waist effortlessly. "I may look like your husband, but I'm not him. Why so nervous?"

"I'm not!" Heat flooded Vivian's cheeks.

Yet his observation struck true. Why should she hesitate?

Other men fled at Nathaniel's name. This one stayed - even flirted. The realization emboldened her.

Vivian's fingers lifted to tilt Julian's chin. "Not nervous, darling. Just concerned you might be."

Surprise flickered in his eyes. "Is that so? Do tell."

"You couldn't handle me," Vivian challenged.

Julian's brows arched. "Rumor paints Mrs. Blackwood as quite the proper lady. Does Nathaniel know this wild side?"

"Why would I tell him? The man's as romantic as a spreadsheet." Vivian rolled her eyes. "All he's good at is killing moods."

Nathaniel belonged in her past. This intriguing man before her? Far more interesting.

Her fingers toyed with his tie. "What's wrong? Scared to play with me?"

Where others might retreat, Julian leaned in. "I'll risk it," he said solemnly.

"Good." Vivian tugged his tie, leading him toward the exit. "This place won't do. Let's find somewhere more... private."

Julian followed willingly, amusement dancing in his eyes.

Nathan Prescott chose that moment to enter the club. His jaw dropped as he witnessed Vivian dragging the stranger toward the elevators.

Shock rooted Nathan to the spot. When he recovered, his phone was already dialing. "Nathaniel? You'll never guess who I just saw."

"Make it quick."

"Your wife's about to check into a hotel with your twin!"

Nathan delivered the final blow: "The bastard looks exactly like you."
###Chapter 113

Vivian flagged down a cab, pulling Julian inside with her. She gave the driver their destination in a crisp tone.

Twenty minutes later, the taxi rolled to a stop.

"Here we are. Let's go!" Vivian tugged Julian out by his tie, her grip firm.

Before them stood a row of futuristic dome-shaped houses, their neon-lit exteriors pulsing softly under the moonlight. The effect was mesmerizing—like stepping into a constellation.

"My private sanctuary," Vivian announced, spinning to face him with a triumphant grin. "What do you think? Only a select few know about this place."

Julian studied the glowing structures, one brow arching. "Secret hideout?"

"Exactly."

An attendant materialized, bowing slightly. "Ms. Lockhart, Room No. 3 is ready as always. Your usual setup is prepared."

Vivian flashed a smile. "Perfect."

Room No. 3 was a gamer's paradise—soundproof, secluded, and decked out with the latest tech. Vivian punched in the code and swung the door open. "After you, partner."

Julian stepped inside, expecting velvet drapes and mood lighting. His jaw dropped. "What the—? This isn't a—"

Vivian was already stroking the sleek surface of a Titan X9 keyboard, her eyes alight. "This baby has third-gen optical switches and zero latency. Paired with that 240Hz monitor? We're unstoppable."

It took Julian a full minute to reboot his brain. "So when you said 'fun,' you meant... gaming?"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Obviously. I needed a squad—preferably eye candy—but your friends bailed like scared rabbits at Nathaniel's name." She sighed dramatically. "Cowards."

Julian pinched the bridge of his nose, torn between laughter and despair. Mrs. Blackwood was full of surprises.

"Lucky for you," he said, cracking his knuckles, "I'm a beast at Legacy Quest. What's the game plan?"

Vivian powered up the rigs. "Since we're short-handed, let's go old-school. One-on-one."

"Name your poison."

"Legacy Quest: Origins."

Julian choked. "That relic? You're into retro?"

"Classics never die." She tossed him a controller, eyes gleaming. "Less talking, more losing."

Three brutal rounds later, Julian was questioning his entire existence. Vivian annihilated him with terrifying precision.

——

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Group headquarters...

Nathaniel hung up on Oliver and returned to his paperwork.

Divorced. Done. Vivian's antics were none of his concern.

Yet the financial report in his hands might as well have been hieroglyphics. His brain kept replaying Oliver's words: She booked a hotel room with some guy.

The pen snapped in his grip.

"Damn it."

He grabbed his phone and dialed. What happened next would shock them both—
###Chapter 114

The robotic voice echoed in Ethan's ear: "The number you have dialed is no longer in service."

No longer in service?

Ethan clenched his jaw, struggling to contain his fury. Maybe Vivian had simply changed her number. It didn't necessarily mean she was avoiding him.

He opened their chat history and sent a single question mark.

The red exclamation mark appeared instantly. Blocked.

"Goddamn it!" Ethan swore under his breath, his face stormy.

She'd severed all ties completely. That woman had no mercy!

Only seven days since their divorce, and she'd already poached Blackwood Group's biggest clients. Now she was partying in nightclubs with different men every evening. Living her best life, wasn't she?

Meanwhile, her ex-husband's reputation was in tatters!

Ethan rubbed his temples, teeth grinding. After a moment's thought, he dialed Ethan Young's number.

"I need guest records for every hotel in Newport City from the past thirty minutes."

Ethan Young sounded confused. "Mr. Blackwood? What's happened? Why would you need—are you... trying to catch Mrs. Blackwood cheating?"

"Is that your concern?" Ethan's voice turned dangerous.

"Not at all! I'll get the records immediately!"

Despite his fear, curiosity got the better of Ethan Young. "For what it's worth... Mrs. Blackwood might be reckless, but I truly don't believe she'd take another man to a hotel. You shouldn't worry!"

"Get lost!" Ethan snapped.

Thirty minutes later, the records arrived. Vivian's name was conspicuously absent.

"Just as I said, Mr. Blackwood. Mrs. Blackwood is a proper lady who loves you deeply. Why would she—"

Ethan Young continued boldly, risking his job. "Those club photos with handsome men? Clearly just to provoke you. Even saints have their limits after what you did. Her reaction is perfectly normal."

Ethan expected fury. Perhaps banishment to Colombia's coffee fields or the Parimean fishing grounds. Instead, silence.

Then, unexpectedly: "You think she's doing this... for my attention?"

Ethan Young nearly choked. "Well... you could interpret it that way."

The ice in Ethan's expression thawed. By the call's end, his lips even curved slightly.

Morning light filtered through the curtains.

Vivian stretched, then clapped Julian Carter on the back. "You actually kept up with me, kid. Impressive. We should game again."

As a top-tier player who usually demolished opponents within seconds, Vivian rarely found equals. This rookie had surprised her.

Leia's "gift" had exceeded expectations.

"You're not bad yourself, Mrs. Blackwood." Julian studied her with newfound respect.

He scribbled digits on a sticky note and pressed it to her shoulder. "My private line. Call anytime."

"Deal!" Vivian grinned. "One thing—don't call me that. It's cursed."

Julian raised an eyebrow. "What then?"

"Angel. No—Rich Angel." She said it dead serious.

Julian's laughter rang out. "Alright, Rich Angel."

Humming, Vivian returned to Sunrise Heights, steps light.

Divorced life was glorious. If she'd known freedom felt this good, she'd never have wasted four years in that miserable marriage.

The elevator dinged open on her floor.

A familiar towering figure leaned against her door, clearly having waited long. His voice dripped ice: "Finally decided to come home?"
###Chapter 115

Vivian's humming cut off abruptly. Her smile vanished as if wiped away by an unseen hand.

She spun on her heel to retreat, as though she'd stumbled upon something distasteful.

"Damn it." She cursed her own procrastination. Despite her decision to move out, she hadn't found suitable accommodations yet. Living directly across from Nathaniel meant inevitable encounters, no matter how carefully she timed her comings and goings.

The elevator doors began sliding shut as Vivian remained frozen inside.

Nathaniel's hand shot out, stopping the doors. His expression was unreadable. "What's wrong? Weren't you enjoying yourself earlier? Why the sudden guilt?"

"Guilt?" Vivian stepped forward, chin lifted in defiance. "That's rich, Mr. Blackwood. So what if I was having fun? I didn't commit any crimes. Why should I feel guilty? You're the CEO of a major corporation - shouldn't you be asleep instead of lurking around to harass single women at this hour?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "I don't care what you do, but remember your position. Consider this a warning. Multiple headlines featuring you with different men in two days - is this something to be proud of?"

Vivian's temper flared. How had she ever loved this arrogant man for four years? She'd lost herself completely, becoming the kind of lovesick fool she despised.

Now that she'd regained her senses, she wouldn't tolerate his insults.

"We're divorced, Mr. Blackwood," she said coldly. "Who I spend time with is none of your concern."

Nathaniel's response was eerily calm. "I understand you're hurting, but seeking attention this way is childish. We haven't announced our divorce yet. This behavior will only fuel gossip and make reconciliation impossible."

Vivian stared in disbelief. What alternate reality was this man living in?

Yes, the divorce had initially pained her, but she'd moved on completely. Her only regret was not ending things sooner.

"Stop pretending. I see right through you," Nathaniel said icily.

He advanced, pinning her against the wall. "There are better ways to get my attention than this pathetic jealousy act." His gaze dropped to her lips. "Like kissing me, perhaps?"

He closed his eyes, waiting.

In his mind, Vivian's recent escapades were just attempts to replace him. Now that he stood before her, surely she couldn't resist.

For a fleeting moment, Vivian wavered. Then reality crashed down.

What kind of narcissist was this man? How had she never noticed before?

"Do you really think you're irresistible?" she growled, shoving him away with both hands. "Keep dreaming!"
###Chapter 116

Ethan's eyes snapped open, burning with frustration. "You can play your little games, Vivian, but don't push me too far. A little teasing is fun, but there's a line."

He closed the distance between them, his confidence unshaken.

To him, this was just another one of Vivian's ploys—an attempt to make him jealous. After all, she had been obsessed with him for years. There was no way she had moved on that easily.

Vivian was beyond exasperated. She pulled out her phone and snapped a photo of his face. "Ethan, you need professional help. Is this your idea of revenge because of the headlines? Leave now, or I swear I'll drag you to court tomorrow."

Ethan froze, his gaze narrowing at the phone in her hand. "What the hell are you doing?"

Vivian ignored him. The moment the photo was taken, she dialed the police. Her voice trembled with fake distress. "Officer, I need help! I'm at Sunrise Heights. A stalker followed me home and won't leave. He's harassing me—please hurry!"

Ethan's jaw tightened. He almost scoffed, ready to argue that the police wouldn’t interfere in a domestic dispute—until he remembered.

They weren’t married anymore.

Legally, this was harassment.

Vivian smirked at his hesitation. "The nearest station is five minutes away, Mr. Blackwood. If you don’t leave, they’ll cuff you before you can blink."

She recited coldly, "Article 237 of the Criminal Code—sexual harassment carries a minimum five-year sentence. Julian Montgomery specializes in these cases. Try me."

Ethan's expression darkened. So this wasn’t a game. She genuinely wanted him gone.

Women never rejected him. This was new. And infuriating.

A dangerous possessiveness coiled inside him.

"Sexual harassment, huh?" His voice was low, rough.

Before she could react, he seized her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Then let me show you what a real offense looks like."

His mouth crashed down on hers.

Vivian gasped against his lips, her eyes wide. She shoved at his shoulders, but it only made him deepen the kiss, his grip unrelenting.

Ethan told himself this wasn’t about love. It was about control. But ever since he’d tasted her, he couldn’t stop craving more.

The air between them burned.

What is wrong with this man?!

When they were married, he’d barely glanced at her. Now? He couldn’t keep his hands off her. Did he really think she’d just surrender?

With a sharp jerk, she stomped on his foot.

Ethan hissed in pain, finally releasing her.

Vivian’s chest heaved, her lips swollen. "You’re done, Ethan. I’ll ruin you."

He smirked, unfazed. "Looking forward to it."
###Chapter 117

Ethan Blackwood dismissed Vivian Lockhart's warning entirely. He assumed her threats were empty—that at most, she'd try to provoke him by flaunting other men in front of him.

The following day.

Ethan arrived at The Golden Leaf, a high-end teahouse in Paris, for a crucial business meeting with Richard Ashford, chairman of Ashford Group.

Ashford Group ranked among the top four electronics distributors in the country. Kingsley Holdings, once H Group's closest partner, had been on equal footing with Ashford Group—until Vivian had severed that alliance. Now, Ethan needed to secure a new distributor fast to prevent Blackwood Group's sales from plummeting.

Richard had been waiting in the VIP lounge. The moment Ethan entered, the older man rose with a practiced smile and extended his hand. "Ethan, it's been too long. Finally making time for your old friend?"

"Always a pleasure, Richard." Ethan's tone carried effortless authority, his demeanor cool as he took his seat.

"Try this oolong from the western regions. Exceptionally fragrant—I think you'll appreciate it." Richard poured the tea himself, playing the gracious host.

Despite Richard's stronger negotiating position, Blackwood Group's dominance in the industry was undeniable. Though decades younger, Ethan commanded the room with natural superiority. More importantly, Blackwood's electronics were unmatched in quality, backed by a fiercely loyal customer base. Partnering with them meant instant access to Paris's largest electronics market.

For years, Kingsley Holdings had reaped those benefits. Now, it was Ashford Group's turn—and Richard wasn't about to let this opportunity slip.

"Never thought Leonard Kingsley would cut ties with Blackwood Group. Claimed he wanted to work with some obscure startup instead. Foolish move..." Richard shook his head, sipping his tea.

"His loss, your gain. I look forward to our partnership," he added brightly.

"Likewise." Ethan's response was detached, his attention seemingly elsewhere.

Richard, ever the shrewd businessman, studied him before clearing his throat. "Since we're both committed, why not sign the contract today? For the next three years, Blackwood Group will allocate 80% of its electronics to Ashford Group. In return..." He leaned forward. "Beyond the base price, we'll remit 10% of quarterly profits to Blackwood Group. What do you think?"

The offer was generous, yet Ethan remained impassive. Truthfully, he hesitated—not due to any dislike for Ashford Group, but because of his grandfather's longstanding decree: No dealings with the Ashfords.

Four years ago, despite Ashford Group's superior proposal, Blackwood Group had chosen Kingsley Holdings solely because of that prohibition.

Richard's smile tightened as the silence stretched. "Something troubling you, Ethan?"

Ethan met his gaze directly. "To be frank, Richard, my grandfather forbade any collaboration between our families. So I have to ask—what exactly happened between you two?"
###Chapter 118

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed slightly at Richard's words before curving into a practiced smile. "Mr. Ashford, there must be some misunderstanding. Your father was a decorated war hero - I've always respected him. What possible conflict could exist between our families?"

"Is that so?" Ethan's response was measured. He sipped his tea, studying Richard's face for tells. Truthfully, he'd conducted extensive due diligence on Ashford Enterprises before considering this partnership. Nothing in his investigations had suggested any animosity between the Ashfords and Blackwoods.

Yet Ethan couldn't ignore the nagging doubt. His relationship with Alfred Blackwood had been strained for years - the old man had refused to see him since the funeral. Direct confirmation was impossible.

"Absolutely true," Richard asserted, though his fingers twitched against the teacup. After a beat, he exhaled sharply. "I'll be frank - in my youth, I may have had... disagreements with your late father."

"With Vincent?" Ice crept into Ethan's tone. "Explain."

Richard barked a humorless laugh. "What causes friction between men? Business... or women." His expression darkened with old bitterness. "This was before your father married Eleanor. We were rivals in both boardrooms and bedrooms. There was... a woman. Played us both for fools before vanishing."

The memory clearly still rankled. Richard's knuckles whitened around his cup.

"Let this be a lesson, Nathaniel. Women excel at feigning vulnerability while scheming behind pretty smiles. Give them an inch, they'll take everything."

The words conjured an unwelcome image of Isabella. The transformation from docile wife to cunning businesswoman still unsettled him. Perhaps Richard wasn't entirely wrong.

"Regardless," Richard continued, "any feud died with Vincent. Four years is long enough to bury hatchets. And frankly..." His lips twisted. "Your wife seems far more invested in Kingsley Holdings' alliance with the Osbornes than your interests. Why protect a traitor?"

The temperature in the room plummeted.

Richard raised placating hands. "I'm not sowing discord for the contract. But a man who lets his woman undermine him..." He stood, gathering his briefcase. "Think on it."

Ethan remained silent. Richard's account felt incomplete - there were missing pieces to this history. The partnership would wait until he uncovered them.

His phone vibrated. Ethan Young's name flashed onscreen.

"Mr. Blackwood! Turn on the news immediately - it's Mrs. Blackwood! She's gone completely mad!"
###Chapter 119

Ethan Young's voice crackled through the phone, urgent and panicked. Nathaniel Blackwood's brow furrowed as he abruptly ended the call.

"What fresh hell is she concocting now?" The thought exhausted him.

"Trouble in paradise, Nathaniel? Wife issues?" Leonard Kingsley paused mid-exit, sinking back into his chair at the overheard distress.

With a sharp gesture, Nathaniel signaled a waiter to turn on the wall-mounted television.

The screen flickered to life, revealing Isabella Lockhart's pale, makeup-free face. Flanked by a sea of flashing cameras, her trembling lips parted.

"My deepest apologies for occupying public attention." A single tear traced her cheek. "Today marks the official end of my four-year marriage to Mr. Blackwood. We've chosen an amicable separation."

She clasped her hands tightly. "I'll always cherish our time together. Now, I only wish him happiness."

The press corps erupted like starving piranhas.

"Mrs. Blackwood! Is infidelity the real reason for your divorce?"

"Your livestream mentioned Mr. Blackwood's illegitimate child - can you confirm?"

"Sources claim you've been spotted with Theodore Osborne's son Liam on multiple overnight outings. Mutual affairs?"

Isabella's shoulders shook with silent sobs. "Our worlds... were never compatible." Her voice broke. "Some truths... I'm not brave enough to share."

The unspoken accusation hung heavier than any confession. Nathaniel watched his reputation unravel in real-time - Isabella's masterstroke of revenge for last night's humiliation.

Jeremy coughed awkwardly. "Change the channel," he barked at the waiter.

The screen went dark. Silence thickened between them.

Nathaniel's knuckles whitened around his whiskey glass. Ice clinked ominously.

"Women, am I right?" Leonard attempted camaraderie. "My ex-wife vanished with half my fortune after faking terminal cancer. If I ever find that bi—"

A glacial stare cut him off.

"Since Mrs. Blackwood's made your divorce public," Leonard backtracked smoothly, "why let ancient history hinder our partnership? The contract's ready."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Sign it."

Grandfather's prohibition against Kingsley Holdings no longer mattered. Not after Isabella's televised betrayal. Whatever crimes Leonard committed against the Lockharts? Not his concern anymore.

Their signatures dried in under twenty minutes. Nathaniel's phone lit up instantly.

"Fool boy!" Alfred Blackwood's roar distorted the speaker. "You dare shake hands with that murderer? Get your ass home now!"
###Chapter 120

Ethan Blackwood let out a weary sigh as he turned the car toward the Blackwood estate. He'd known Grandfather would disapprove of his partnership with Ashford Holdings, but the old man's spies worked faster than anticipated. The impending punishment weighed heavily on his mind.

Perhaps this confrontation would finally reveal what the Ashfords had done to deserve such hatred.

Before Ethan could reach the front door, Alfred Blackwood's booming voice echoed through the marble halls.

"That boy has lost his damned mind! Selling his soul for profit! I'll whip some sense into him today—don't you dare interfere!"

The scars on Ethan's back still throbbed from last time. He squared his shoulders and stepped forward. Military discipline ran deep in the Blackwood bloodline—every child raised under that iron fist grew up rigidly principled. Even Ethan rarely defied his grandfather.

Except when it came to Vivian Lockhart.

"Grandfather." Ethan entered the parlor with perfect posture.

Winston nearly wept with relief. "Master Alfred, please compose yourself! Young Master Blackwood has arrived!"

The patriarch's furious gaze locked onto Ethan before hurling a porcelain teacup. "You disgrace! How dare you show your face here?"

Ethan barely flinched. "You summoned me."

"So now you've grown a tongue to sass me?" Alfred's face purpled with rage. "I should've disowned you years ago!"

Ethan stood motionless, absorbing the tirade. This ritual was older than his childhood—Grandfather's temper tantrums where logic held no sway. Not even Ethan's father had ever stood against them.

"I made it clear—no dealings with Ashford Holdings! No contact with Richard Ashford!"

"Yes, sir."

"Then explain this betrayal!" Alfred brandished his cane. "You need proper discipline!"

"By all means." Ethan's lips twisted bitterly. "The scars from last time haven't even faded. Though I must commend your consistency, Grandfather—that stone heart of yours never falters."

"You—!" Alfred sputtered, cane trembling. For all his bluster, he'd never actually break his only heir.

Winston intervened hastily. "Sir, consider the business merits! Ashford Holdings dominates the electronics sector. This alliance benefits both parties."

Alfred's shoulders slumped. "I'm thinking of Vivian. How would she feel knowing her husband partnered with her father's greatest enemy?"

Ethan's laugh held no warmth. "Why would she care? The divorce papers are signed. I mean nothing to her now."

"How can you say that?" Alfred raised his cane again.

Winston blocked the strike. "Master Alfred, please! The young master speaks truth. If Miss Lockhart cared, she wouldn't have scheduled that press conference."

"Press conference?" Alfred's eyes sharpened. "Show me!"

Winston paled. "Forgive me, I spoke out of turn—"

The old man still clung to hopes of reconciliation, which was why no one had told him about Vivian's global announcement. Once broadcast, the world would know their marriage had ended—along with any future alliances.

Ethan's expression hardened. "Stop coddling him. Show Grandfather the truth—let him see what Vivian really is."
###Chapter 121

Alfred Blackwood sat motionless for what felt like hours after Vivian's press conference ended. His wrinkled hands rested on his cane, fingers tapping an absent rhythm.

Nathaniel watched his grandfather's profile, relieved. "Finally, he'll see it wasn't just my fault."

The truth was simple - he'd never loved Vivian, and yes, he'd hurt her. But she'd never loved him either. While he'd played pretend with Cassandra, Vivian had been building something real with Liam. They'd even talked about starting a family.

That mutual understanding was why their divorce had been so amicable. So why was she painting him as the villain now?

"Grandfather," Nathaniel gestured to the paused screen, "she couldn't wait to announce our divorce publicly. This was always her endgame - freedom to be with Liam. That woman is far from the innocent victim everyone believes."

Alfred finally turned from the television, bushy white eyebrows drawn together. "Is that really what you took from this? No wonder you failed every literature exam at Cambridge."

Nathaniel blinked. "Then what am I missing?"

"You absolute fool!" Alfred's cane came down hard on Nathaniel's shin. "She's clearly trying to reconcile!"

Nathaniel barely suppressed an eye roll. "With all due respect, I didn't get that impression."

"Of course you didn't," Alfred scoffed, adjusting his glasses with shaky hands. He rewound to a specific moment, jabbing a bony finger at the subtitles. "Right here - she says she's grateful for your four years together. That's code, boy!"

"Code for what exactly?"

"It means she still cares!" Alfred declared like a professor presenting irrefutable evidence. "She's leaving the door open for reconciliation!"

Nathaniel fought the urge to laugh. Even with his admittedly poor emotional intelligence, he knew basic social niceties when he heard them. This was damage control, not some secret love letter.

"I don't care what excuses you make," Alfred barked, suddenly all military general again. "That girl spelled it out plain as day. If you don't act now, you're not fit to call yourself a Blackwood!"

"Grandfather," Nathaniel sighed, "I know you mean well, but some things can't be fixed. Please stop interfering."

"Interfering? I'm saving you from your own stubbornness! You're both clearly still in love, too proud to admit it!"

Alfred knew his grandson better than anyone. Nathaniel kept his emotions locked tighter than the Blackwood family vaults. Yet mention Vivian, and suddenly the boy couldn't control his temper? That wasn't indifference.

If he waited for Nathaniel to figure this out himself, his great-grandchildren would be collecting social security by then. Time for drastic measures.

Alfred's expression shifted abruptly. "Fine. You've disobeyed me, so punishment is due. But tonight...you'll simply join me for dinner."

Just dinner? Nathaniel's instincts screamed trap. But if it kept the old man from forcing another wedding, he'd play along.

Little did he know, Alfred Blackwood had survived three wars and outmaneuvered countless business rivals. His grandson never stood a chance.
###Chapter 122

The dining table was lavishly set with an extravagant spread of gourmet dishes. Roasted duck, lobster thermidor, and truffle-infused delicacies filled the polished mahogany surface.

Nathaniel Blackwood's brows furrowed as he took his seat. His grandfather Alfred usually preferred simple meals. This elaborate feast screamed ulterior motives.

His instincts were right. This wasn't just dinner. The old fox was plotting something.

Without a word, Nathaniel reached for his silverware.

Alfred cleared his throat from the head of the table. "Patience, boy. We're expecting company."

Just as Nathaniel suspected. His fingers stilled on the fork. Vivian must be the surprise guest. Another transparent matchmaking attempt.

His voice turned glacial. "Grandfather, your meddling is unnecessary. Vivian and I are finished. Stop this charade."

Alfred chuckled, stroking his beard. "Don't flatter yourself. I'd never subject Vivian to your miserable company again."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Since when had his grandfather switched allegiances?

A maid announced cheerfully, "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Lockhart has arrived!"

Vivian strode in confidently, then froze when she spotted Nathaniel. Her discomfort was palpable.

Nathaniel straightened imperceptibly, feigning indifference. Then his stomach lurched.

Theodore Osborne's son Dominic entered behind Vivian. Just the sight of that man made Nathaniel's blood boil.

His glare could have melted steel. "Explain this," he demanded through clenched teeth.

Alfred ignored him, beaming at their guests. "Come in, my dears! I've saved the best seats for you."

Vivian looked ready to bolt. Clearly she'd been ambushed too. Dominic, however, seemed thrilled.

With theatrical flair, he clasped Vivian's hand. "General Blackwood! It's an honor. Your strategy at the Battle of Northridge is still studied at military academies."

Alfred's eyes lit up. "You know of Northridge?"

"Know it? Sir, your encirclement maneuver was pure genius! Turning their numerical advantage against them..."

The two men launched into animated military discussion, leaving Nathaniel and Vivian in strained silence.

After thirty minutes of war stories, Alfred was roaring with laughter. "I see why rumors linked you two! Theodore raised a fine son."

Dominic grinned, lifting Vivian's hand. "No rumors necessary, sir. We're officially together now."

The temperature in the room plummeted. Alfred's smile vanished. "Is this true, Vivian?"

She hesitated, caught between honesty and sparing Alfred's feelings. The truth would hurt him, but denying it might revive old hopes.

Nathaniel's cold voice cut through the tension. "If it's true, say so. We're divorced - no need for pretense."
###Chapter 123

Nathaniel's words ignited a fire in Vivian's veins.

Determined to outmaneuver Nathaniel, she spun toward his grandfather with sparkling eyes. "It's true, Grandfather. Dominic and I are officially together now."

She clasped Dominic's hand tightly. "He's the only one who truly understands me. Who makes me feel safe. Who makes me happy."

Dominic gazed at Vivian beside him. Though this was just an act to provoke Nathaniel, her words still sent warmth spreading through his chest.

He wasn't even her second choice. Yet here he was, playing the doting boyfriend. The realization sent an unexpected thrill through him.

Grandfather Alfred maintained his stern expression for several heartbeats before breaking into laughter. "My dear girl, of course you have my blessing."

His eyes twinkled as he patted Vivian's hand. "I wouldn't have invited you both otherwise. I simply needed to test whether this young man was worthy of you."

A pointed glare at Nathaniel made his meaning clear. "After what you've endured, I'd never let you settle for less than you deserve."

Dominic straightened his shoulders. "General Blackwood, I welcome any test. I excel at most things - even rap battles. Allow me to demonstrate—"

Before anyone could react, he launched into an impressive freestyle. His rhythm was flawless, his flow effortless. The maids stifled giggles behind their hands while even the usually stoic butler cracked a smile.

Only Nathaniel remained stone-faced. "How utterly juvenile," he muttered.

Dinner commenced shortly after.

Alfred raised his glass. "To family. Vivian, my door is always open to you. The Blackwood estate will forever be your sanctuary."

Tears pricked Vivian's eyes. "Thank you, Grandfather. Though Nathaniel and I are through, nothing changes between us."

Dominic placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. "I'll protect her with my life, General. Loving her is my greatest privilege."

"Good man." Alfred beamed before shooting Nathaniel a withering look. "Unlike some ungrateful whelps at this table."

Their glasses clinked in harmony while Nathaniel sat in stony silence, pushing food around his plate with disinterest.

Dominic expertly deboned a piece of sea bass and placed it on Vivian's plate. The gesture was so natural it suggested years of practice.

"See that?" Alfred elbowed Nathaniel sharply. "Dominic may be younger, but he's ten times the gentleman you'll ever be. Vivian's well rid of you."

"Any trained monkey could perform parlor tricks," Nathaniel sneered.

Dominic merely smirked. "Tell me, Mr. Blackwood - after years of marriage, do you even know Vivian's favorite foods? Her allergies? The way she takes her tea?"

The challenge hung in the air like drawn steel.
###Chapter 124

Ethan Blackwood stared at Liam Osborne, completely stunned. Of course he couldn't answer. Despite being married to Vivian Lockhart for four years, he could count on one hand the meals they'd shared. Even then, he'd never bothered to notice her food preferences.

"Such trivial details are beneath my notice," Ethan scoffed, his voice dripping with arrogance.

"Trivial?" Liam's cheerful demeanor vanished instantly, replaced by barely contained fury.

"Exactly. A heartless snake like you wouldn't understand consideration for others." Liam didn't care if his words angered Ethan. Right now, he'd prefer settling this with his fists.

"Do you know how much Vivian sacrificed? She memorized your tastes—mild flavors over spicy, steak cooked medium rare. She mastered over a hundred steak recipes just for you. And what did she get in return? Nothing!"

Ethan's brow furrowed slightly at Liam's outburst. His gaze flickered toward Vivian, searching for confirmation.

But Vivian's expression remained unreadable. "Liam's half-right," she said coolly. "Mr. Blackwood is far colder than I ever was. I remember details about people I care about. That effort was never wasted. Now I'll just be more selective about who deserves it."

Before Ethan could respond, Alfred Blackwood sighed heavily. "Child, I see now how much you've endured. Forcing you two together was wrong. Stay with Liam—he'll treat you right."

Relief flooded Vivian. Thank heavens the old man had finally given up. Liam's Oscar-worthy performance had worked. Honestly, who wouldn't choose warm, attentive Liam over icy Ethan?

To sell the act, Vivian intertwined her fingers with Liam's. "Thank you for understanding, Grandpa. Liam and I will be just fine."

After dinner, Alfred reluctantly saw them out. The mansion felt eerily quiet once they left.

"What a damn shame," the old man muttered, shooting daggers at Ethan who sat reading a magazine. "How can you just sit there? Another man just walked off with your wife!"

Ethan didn't even look up. "Should I grovel and beg?"

"Don't you dare!" Alfred snapped. "It's clear you never cared. Vivian gave everything to that marriage and got nothing back. Let her go—she's better off with Liam."

"Glad we agree," Ethan replied tonelessly, turning a page. Finally, his grandfather accepted the divorce. Maybe now he'd have some peace.

But... did he really not care at all?
###Chapter 125

The Grand Marquis Hotel buzzed with energy as it hosted the prestigious Global Tech Summit.

Reporters and media crews had camped outside since dawn, cameras poised for the arrival of two key figures. The first—Nathaniel Blackwood, the recently divorced heir of the Blackwood dynasty and CEO of Blackwood Group. The second—the elusive genius behind QuantumTech’s revolutionary microchips, the enigmatic Mr. Y.

Mr. Y’s anonymity wasn’t his only intrigue. His exclusive partnership with Nathaniel had shaped the tech industry. QuantumTech’s cutting-edge chips were supplied solely to Blackwood Group, granting them a staggering 75% market dominance. Rumors swirled that Nathaniel’s secret meetings in luxury hotels were with none other than Mr. Y himself.

The summit’s grand hall glittered with innovation. Every major player in tech had staked their claim, showcasing next-gen advancements. Among them stood Lockhart Enterprises—a rising star, but still an outsider.

Their booth was small, tucked away in a quiet corner. No R&D department meant no groundbreaking prototypes to flaunt. But Vivian Lockhart wasn’t here for validation. Hidden behind a sleek black mask, she moved through the crowd, absorbing every detail.

The real spectacle belonged to Blackwood Group and QuantumTech. Their exhibits sprawled across entire floors, drawing swarms of eager attendees. Vivian fought through the throng to reach QuantumTech’s display.

A hostess in a futuristic silver suit presented their latest marvel. "Ladies and gentlemen, behold the Quantum-6 chip—engineered solely by Mr. Y. Utilizing quantum computing and advanced semiconductors, it achieves 99.7% operational efficiency. Currently, it remains exclusive to Blackwood Group."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"QuantumTech is untouchable. No one else comes close."

"Of course. They’re practically married to Blackwood Group."

"It’s not just business. There’s more to it—"

The whispers dipped lower, laced with knowing smirks.

Vivian snapped photos of the Quantum-6, her mind racing. If Lockhart Enterprises secured this tech, surpassing Kingsley Holdings’ seven-billion-dollar demand would be effortless. Market domination would follow.

Her attention sharpened at the hushed gossip.

"I heard Nathaniel and Mr. Y are already here. Bet they’re—"

Vivian didn’t hesitate. She stepped closer, voice low but firm. "Bet they’re what?"
###Chapter 126

"What do you suppose two men are doing alone in a hotel suite together?" The voice dripped with playful insinuation, sparking another round of laughter.

The rumor about Nathaniel Blackwood and the enigmatic Mr. Y had begun as an inside joke among industry elites. But a string of coincidences had lent it an unsettling credibility.

"Not to mention, I heard Mr. Blackwood's divorce wasn't over an affair with a woman. That 'mistress' was just an actress hired by him and Mr. Y to cover the truth..."

"No way!"

Isabella Lockhart's breath hitched. Memories flashed—Nathaniel's aversion to women, his pristine reputation, the way his smiles never quite reached his eyes around her.

If he's really gay, then why did he... that night... Her stomach twisted. She pulled out her phone and typed frantically into the search bar.

The crowd jostled her just as the results loaded. Someone's polished shoe met hers, and her phone clattered to the marble floor.

"Sorry!" She bent awkwardly, her pregnancy making the motion clumsy.

A gloved hand retrieved the device. "Here." The man's tone was indifferent until his gaze snagged on her screen. His eyes sharpened with sudden intrigue.

"Thanks." Isabella snatched it back, cheeks burning. But when their eyes met above their masks, recognition struck like lightning.

"You!"

"You."

They spoke in unison.

"Julian Carter! What's a superstar like you doing here?" Her smile was genuine, her pulse skipping.

"Flattered you remember me." His usual aloofness thawed, just slightly.

"Of course I do! You're the only person who's ever beaten me at Legacy Quest. I've been waiting for a rematch." She held his gaze, noting the faint mole by his brow—the only thing that kept her from mistaking him for Nathaniel in this lighting.

Behind them, the gossip raged on. "I swear, they're together! Stake out The Grand Marquis tonight if you don't believe me!"

No one dared—except Isabella. She needed to know. Four years of marriage deserved answers.

"I've got something to handle, Julian. Catch up later?" She edged toward the elevators.

He fell into step beside her, smirking. "Confronting a lover takes backup. Need an accomplice?"

"L-lover?" The word felt foreign.

"Isn't your husband's male partner technically one?" Julian mused, stepping into the elevator. His excitement outshone hers.

The doors closed.
###Chapter 127

Vivian froze as she watched Julian's eager expression. 'Wait a minute,' she thought. 'My ex-husband is the one having an affair here. Why are you so invested?'

Then it clicked.

"You celebrities really are something else!" Vivian smirked as she stepped into the elevator. "Let me guess - you're hoping Ethan will become your sugar daddy, aren't you?" She felt rather clever, like she'd just solved a mystery.

Julian nearly choked on air. "What?" His eyes widened at this unexpected side of Vivian. "That's quite the imagination you've got there."

"Am I wrong?" Vivian crossed her arms. In the entertainment industry, nothing surprised her anymore.

Idols often played into shipping culture for popularity. Others sought wealthy benefactors. As a member of the famous Nova Boys, Julian's motives seemed obvious.

"Don't do it," Vivian warned. "Ethan Blackwood is terrible news. You'd regret it. Work with me instead." She gave him a calculating look. "If things go well, I might invest in your career. You could be starring in movies before you know it."

She wasn't entirely joking. As a single mother now, Vivian needed profitable investments. The entertainment industry was perfect.

"I'll... consider it." Julian's masked smile widened. 'She's fascinating,' he thought. 'How could Ethan let someone like her go?'

The elevator reached the penthouse. Ethan's suite was impossible to miss - it took up the entire floor.

"Keep watch," Vivian ordered, tiptoeing toward the door. "Cough loudly if anyone comes."

Julian leaned casually against the wall. "So what's your plan here?"

"Plan?" Vivian narrowed her eyes. "We're divorced. He can date whoever he wants. I'm just... verifying rumors. Now hush." She pressed her ear against the door.

Julian chuckled. "You realize this is a five-star hotel, right? The walls are soundproof."

"Men are loud," Vivian insisted. "And I have excellent hearing." She gave a confident thumbs-up, pressing closer to the door.

"You're struggling." Julian reached over her head. "Let me help." He typed the access code.

The door swung open, sending Vivian tumbling inside.
###Chapter 128

"What the—?"

Before Vivian could react, Julian vanished after taunting, "Instead of lurking outside like some creep, why not come in and see for yourself?"

'That little bastard!' Vivian seethed internally. The password to Nathaniel's suite barely registered—she needed to escape. 'If Nathaniel and his secret lover catch me here, I'm dead!'

The expansive suite appeared deserted. Just as Vivian stood to flee, muffled voices drifted from the bathroom.

'Oh god, are they... showering together?'

The mental image made her throat tighten. 'Four years wasted loving a man who prefers... this? Unbelievable.'

Curiosity overpowered reason. Pressing her ear against the glass door—her exceptional hearing picking up Nathaniel's voice clearly through the running water.

"Playing games again? Where've you been this past year?"

'What the hell?' Vivian frowned. She envisioned Nathaniel cornering his elusive lover after a year-long chase.

Silence fell. The chilled glass warmed against her skin.

'Shit!' Vivian jerked back—straight into Nathaniel's glacial stare.

She forced a grin, waving awkwardly. "Fancy meeting you here!"

Mortification burned through her. The marble floor might as well open up and swallow her whole.

Nathaniel loomed over her, water dripping from his tousled dark hair. The white towel clinging to his hips accentuated every sculpted muscle, making Vivian's pulse stutter.

Her cheeks flamed as she struggled to maintain eye contact. "Wrong suite! Didn't mean to interrupt your... private time."

Boldness overtook sense. Rising on tiptoes, she peeked past him—then gaped. "You were talking to yourself?!"

"Leaving so soon?" Nathaniel blocked her escape, voice dripping frost. "After spying on me in the shower?"

"I didn't see anything!" Vivian protested, then cringed. 'God, that sounds worse.'

His smirk turned predatory. "Not satisfied?" In one fluid motion, he yanked her into the steamy bathroom. "Let's remedy that."
###Chapter 129

The shower's steam wrapped around them like a thick fog.

Nathaniel loomed over Vivian, pressing her against the tiled wall. "Is this what you wanted?" His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Can you see me clearly now?"

Her head spun as heat flooded her cheeks. She twisted in his grip, frustration boiling over. "Release me, Blackwood! We both know you prefer men - stop pretending!"

"Prefer men?" Nathaniel's eyes narrowed in genuine confusion. 'Where the hell did she get that idea?'

"Are you denying it?" Vivian seized the opportunity. "Is Mr. Y from QuantumTech really your lover? How long has this been going on? Was Cassandra just your beard?"

He stared at her, torn between anger and laughter at her absurd accusations.

Nathaniel leaned closer, his lips brushing her earlobe. "Do I seem like a man who prefers men to you?"

Vivian's mind blanked as his bare torso filled her vision. The towel barely covered him, forcing her to avert her gaze before she got whiplash from looking away.

"I don't care who you sleep with! Just put some clothes on!" She squirmed uncomfortably. "This is beyond inappropriate!"

"So you're admitting you have no idea about my preferences?"

"Obviously not! I-" Her retort died as Nathaniel captured her lips in a searing kiss.

Electric heat shot through Vivian's body. Though inexperienced, she found herself melting against him, dangerously close to surrender.

"Still think I prefer men?" Nathaniel growled when they broke apart, his darkened eyes holding hers captive.

Vivian's pulse hammered in her throat. This wasn't how she'd imagined this confrontation going.

"Need more convincing?" He tilted her chin up with one finger. "I can demonstrate another way if you're still unclear."

Her dazed expression made him smirk. Before she could process his meaning, Nathaniel swept her into his arms and carried her toward the bedroom.

Only when her back hit the mattress did Vivian grasp the escalating situation. "Nathaniel, wait-"

He silenced her with a finger to her lips, desire thickening his voice. "Don't play coy. You're a grown woman - you know exactly how I can prove myself to you."
###Chapter 130

Ethan's gaze darkened with hunger, his lips dangerously close to hers again. Vivian felt like a helpless lamb offering herself to a starving wolf.

It would be a shame to waste such an invitation.

Besides, this was his chance to prove those ridiculous rumors about him wrong once and for all.

"I already ended things with you," he murmured, voice rough. "Yet here you are, teasing me. If you want me this badly, who am I to deny you? Wouldn’t want you thinking your ex-husband is selfish."

"Misunderstanding!" Vivian gasped, her entire body burning. She had been reckless, she’d admit that—but this wasn’t what she’d intended.

"I came out of curiosity! I just wanted to see the infamous Mr. Y! I never planned to sleep with you!" She shoved against his chest. "If I still had any feelings for you, I wouldn’t have divorced you, right?"

The heat in Ethan’s eyes vanished, replaced by ice. Still pinning her down, he demanded, "So. You still believe those rumors?"

"No! I don’t!" Vivian shook her head frantically, her expression sincere.

The air turned thick with tension.

Ethan’s jaw tightened as he studied her. Then, abruptly, he snapped, "Get out."

He’s letting me go? She didn’t hesitate—scrambling off the bed and bolting from the suite.

The moment the door shut behind her, she scanned the hallway for Julian.

That little traitor. How had he gotten the suite code? Why had he pushed her into that disaster? But no matter where she looked, he was nowhere.

Did I imagine him? It made no sense—a pop idol like him at a tech summit?

Giving up, she headed downstairs. When she reached Lockhart Enterprises’ exhibition booth, chaos greeted her.

A man in a black suit was berating her staff. "Who’s in charge here? Pack your things—you’re fired!"
###Chapter 131

Lockhart Enterprises was still in its infancy, with only a handful of employees. The two young women managing the exhibition booth were just interns. This grand event was far beyond their usual scope, and they had been treading carefully all day.

"Sir, we apologize, but Ms. Lockhart is extremely busy. If you have any concerns, you may address them to us."

"Fine!" The man's face twisted in irritation. "The Global Tech Summit has strict participation criteria. Your company hasn't even been operational for a full year, and you have no proprietary products. You clearly don’t qualify. You have three minutes to vacate this hall—or I’ll have security escort you out."

"But we were invited!" one intern protested. "If you remove us now, you’re defying the organizers!"

The man’s face flushed crimson at being challenged. With a furious kick, he toppled their display board. "That was then. This is now. If the higher-ups say you’re out, you’re out. And if you resist, don’t blame me for what happens next!"

He barked orders into his walkie-talkie, summoning a squad of security guards to dismantle Lockhart Enterprises’ booth.

A crowd of industry professionals gathered, but none intervened. Instead, they watched with smug satisfaction. To them, small startups like Lockhart Enterprises had no place among the elite.

"Go ahead. Try it."

Vivian Lockhart’s voice cut through the murmurs like a blade. She strode forward, chin lifted, eyes blazing. Though her tone was calm, the authority in her presence was undeniable.

"Ms. Lockhart!" The interns rushed to her side, relief flooding their faces. In just two weeks under her leadership, they’d already witnessed her unshakable resolve.

They quickly briefed her. "This man claims we don’t belong here. He threatened to destroy our setup if we don’t leave!"

"So, you’re in charge?" The man sneered, emboldened by her gender. "Then stop wasting time. Take your junk and get out!"

Vivian despised bullies—especially those who preyed on the weak to inflate their own egos. Her expression turned glacial. "Apologize. On your knees. Now. Before it’s too late."

"What did you just say?" The man’s face contorted in disbelief. "Do you have any idea who I am? I could ruin you with a snap of my fingers!"

"Why would I know a nobody like you?" Vivian checked her watch. "But I’ll give you thirty seconds to introduce yourself."

Her dismissiveness enraged him. He seized her collar, snarling, "You’re begging for a beating, aren’t you?"

Vivian glanced at his grip on her shirt. "Remove your filthy hands. Now."

"You dare talk back to me?" Humiliated in front of the crowd, he raised his hand to strike her.

A sharp crack echoed through the hall.

Then—a scream.
###Chapter 132

Gasps erupted through the crowd as they realized the scream hadn't come from Vivian Lockhart at all.

Vincent Sharpe clutched his twisted arm, face contorted in pain. "You broke it! Damn bitch broke my arm!" Despite his injury, venom still dripped from his words. "Do you know who I am? Head of security for this entire summit! Everyone in Newport City knows not to cross me!"

His threats meant nothing to Vivian. She pressed her designer heel harder into his shoulder, watching with satisfaction as he whimpered. "Three seconds. Apologize to me and my team, or I'll snap the other one too."

The man writhed beneath her, pride warring with self-preservation. When Vivian increased pressure, his resolve shattered. "Alright! I'm sorry! I was out of line! Just...just let me go!"

Murmurs spread like wildfire through the gathering crowd.

"Is that woman insane? She just assaulted Ethan Blackwood's head of security!"

"Doesn't she know Nathaniel Blackwood practically owns this industry? Her company's finished."

"Rumor has it the new summit president is Blackwood's biggest investor. Lockhart Enterprises won't survive the week."

Vivian's interns trembled beside her. "Ms. Lockhart," one whispered urgently, "that's Mr. Blackwood's man! We should be begging for mercy, not provoking him!"

The name Nathaniel Blackwood carried weight in Newport City - more powerful than any law. Crossing someone under his protection was corporate suicide.

Vivian's lips curled in realization. "So that explains our revoked invitation." She removed her foot from Vincent's shoulder with deliberate slowness. "Tell your boss if he's got a problem with me, he should say it to my face. Using a public event for petty revenge? How childish."

A sudden hush fell over the hall as the crowd parted like the Red Sea. Someone important had arrived.

Vincent crawled toward the newcomer like a wounded animal seeking shelter. "Mr. Blackwood! I tried removing them as instructed, but this woman attacked me! She's challenging your authority right to your face!"

Vincent expected immediate retaliation. Nathaniel always protected his people.

The man who stepped forward bore no resemblance to the casual figure from earlier. Impeccable in a charcoal Tom Ford suit, every strand of hair perfectly in place, Nathaniel Blackwood commanded attention without speaking. His mere presence made lesser men check their collars.

Cold gray eyes flickered over Vincent's pathetic form before locking onto Vivian. "You did this?" Nathaniel's voice could freeze molten steel.

Vivian met his gaze without flinching. "He earned it." She squared her shoulders, ready for battle. "If you're here to fight for your lackey, let's get this over with."
###Chapter 133

"Hah, you're finished now! Mr. Blackwood will destroy you!" Vincent sneered through gritted teeth, clutching his shattered arm.

Pain radiated through his body, sweat beading on his forehead. Yet the thought of Vivian's impending doom brought him twisted satisfaction.

He turned to Nathaniel with malicious glee. "Sir, let's handle this personally. An eye for an eye, don't you think? We should shatter every bone in her body - teach her not to disrespect our industry!"

"Shatter her bones?" Nathaniel's eyes darkened dangerously. "Interesting suggestion."

Vivian's blood ran cold. She never imagined he could be this cruel. 'We were married once! Even if it was just to hide his orientation, I was still his wife! Does he really need to go this far?'

Vincent immediately puffed up with arrogance, barking at the security team. "You heard Mr. Blackwood! Break all her limbs! Let's see how high and mighty she acts then!"

As the guards moved forward, Nathaniel suddenly lunged at Vincent, delivering a brutal kick to his chest that sent him crashing backward.

"Break his limbs instead," Nathaniel commanded coldly, not even glancing at the writhing man.

Vincent turned deathly pale. "Mr. Blackwood! What- What did I do wrong? Please, explain!"

The entire room froze in shock. Vivian stared, equally confused. 'What's his game now?'

Vincent crawled pathetically, clutching Nathaniel's trousers. "Tell me my mistake! I followed your orders! At least give me that much!"

Nathaniel's gaze turned glacial. "I said ask her to leave. Not throw her out. If you can't follow simple instructions, you're worthless to me."

The security team moved swiftly, dragging away the screaming Vincent. His terrified shrieks echoed through the hall until they faded into silence.

The remaining spectators scattered quickly, not daring to whisper about the Blackwood heir. Within moments, the exhibition hall stood empty once more.

Nathaniel remained motionless, his piercing stare fixed on Vivian. The intensity of his gaze could shatter glass.

Vivian deliberately ignored him, turning to her interns instead. "That display screen is damaged. Contact logistics immediately for a replacement."

The interns worked with heads bowed, too intimidated to even glance at Nathaniel. Their admiration for Vivian grew exponentially - she didn't even flinch before the most powerful man in the city.

'She's absolutely fearless!'

Nathaniel clearly disliked being disregarded. He seized Vivian's wrist abruptly. "Don't pretend this is serious."

Vivian frowned. "I don't follow, Mr. Blackwood."

"You and that Osborne boy created this shell company just to steal Blackwood Group's biggest client. This petty revenge scheme has succeeded - why keep pretending?"

Realization dawned. Vivian laughed bitterly. "Nathaniel Blackwood, you actually think Liam and I founded Lockhart Enterprises because of you?"

"What other reason could there be?" Nathaniel's grip tightened. "You stole my lawyers, built a rival firm - this is clearly about vengeance."
###Chapter 134

"I'm clearly doing this because—" Vivian paused, then flashed a mischievous grin as she quipped, "I want your money!"

Ethan looked utterly speechless. He could tell she was brushing him off, her answer revealing nothing about her true motives.

"I told you before—if you need money, just ask. We were married, after all. I'll do my best to meet your financial needs. No need to beat around the bush."

"Just ask you?" Vivian scoffed. "What if I demanded half the Blackwood fortune? Would you hand it over without hesitation?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "That's absurd."

"Oh? And here I thought my ex-husband was generous. Turns out, you're still stingy when it counts. Can't even humor a simple request..."

Though his irritation was palpable, Vivian showed no concern about provoking him further. "You don’t know me at all. I’m greedy. A few million might satisfy others, but not me!"

She had two children on the way. Financial security was non-negotiable. She wanted wealth matching Ethan’s—so her kids would never feel deprived under her care.

The once docile wife he remembered now stood before him, bold and unapologetic. Yet, her ambition intrigued him. She wasn’t begging for handouts—she wanted to fight for it.

Disdain and reluctant admiration warred within him.

"Do you really think poaching my lawyers and signing with Kingsley Holdings will solve everything?" Ethan warned, voice sharp. "Business isn’t some game. One wrong move, and you’ll drown. Or have you forgotten what happened to your family?"

His words struck deep. Vivian’s fists clenched. She knew the risks. The Lockharts had once stood among Newport City’s Elite Eight—until they were crushed overnight.

The memories still haunted her.

Noticing her distress, Ethan softened slightly. "South Group—no, Kingsley Holdings—demanded eight billion in sales from you, didn’t they? That’s impossible for a small firm like yours."

"I’ll decide what’s possible," she snapped.

"Stop being stubborn. We’re divorced, but I don’t hold grudges. I don’t want to watch you fail—it’d reflect poorly on me too." His harsh tone barely masked his concern.

Vivian only heard condescension. "What’s your point, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Simple. You’re out of your depth. Take the money I offer and live comfortably. Stay away from this battlefield."

In his mind, she belonged in a gilded cage, safe from the cutthroat world she’d naively entered.

Her lips curled in defiance. "Don’t underestimate me. You’ll see exactly what I’m capable of."

"Fine." His patience snapped. "Then don’t blame me when I join the Summit in crushing Lockhart Enterprises."
###Chapter 135

Vivian's stubborn refusal made Ethan stop trying to reason with her.

He turned on his heel without another word, his expression turning icy.

When he reappeared at the center of the summit forum, all eyes immediately locked onto him.

Ethan tilted his head slightly toward his assistant. "Tell Maxwell Thornton to make an official announcement. Lockhart Enterprises is blacklisted from this summit." His voice dropped lower. "And ensure no company dares to partner with them."

The Global Tech Summit wasn't just a platform for product launches. Its core was always the exclusive forum where industry titans gathered to shape the future.

As CEO of Blackwood Group, Ethan controlled seventy-five percent of the electronics market. His influence here was absolute.

Ethan Young swallowed hard. "Sir, there's a complication." He hesitated before continuing. "Rumors suggest Maxwell won't retain his presidency this year. He may lack authority to issue such an announcement."

The Electronics Technology Association president held immense power - approving new entrants, setting industry standards. For years, that position had been held by Maxwell, Ethan's protégé.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. "Not being re-elected?"

"Yes." Ethan Young nodded. "Several heavyweights entered the race this time. Even with our backing, Maxwell couldn't compete. Especially since..." He lowered his voice. "The new president reportedly secured Mr. Y's decisive vote."

Ethan's eyebrow arched. "So he's finally showing himself."

Mr. Y was a legend who'd never interfered in past elections. His sudden involvement now was... intriguing.

Ethan Young quickly added, "Whoever the new president is, they'd be foolish to cross you. I'll deliver your message personally. Lockhart Enterprises won't survive this."

He understood Ethan's fury. Not only had Vivian built her company with her lover, they'd stolen Blackwood Group's biggest client. Mere blacklisting seemed lenient.

As the forum commenced, silence fell across the grand hall.

After Ethan's opening remarks, the host announced excitedly, "As you know, our association recently elected new leadership. Please welcome our incoming president!"
###Chapter 136

The auditorium erupted in applause the moment the host concluded the introduction.

Every industry leader and VIP fixed their gaze on the entrance, anticipation thick in the air. Whoever walked through those doors would shape the future of electronics technology for the next four years.

Spotlights illuminated a striking figure entering the room. Vivian Lockhart commanded attention in her tailored black power suit, her chestnut hair secured in an elegant chignon.

"Impossible!" Ethan Young blurted out, rubbing his eyes. "Tell me I'm hallucinating - that's Mrs. Blackwood!"

Nathaniel Blackwood's brow furrowed as he took in Vivian's poised demeanor, clearly unprepared for this development.

With effortless grace, Vivian ascended the podium. Her piercing gaze swept across the assembled crowd. "Good afternoon," she announced, her voice steady. "I'm Vivian Lockhart, your newly appointed director of the Electronics Technology Association."

Gone were her usual casual outfits or glamorous evening gowns. Today, Vivian embodied professional perfection - the sharp lines of her suit accentuated by silver-framed glasses that lent her an air of sharp intelligence.

The fitted pencil skirt highlighted her curves, while sheer stockings drew attention to her toned legs, adding subtle sensuality to her polished look. Unsurprisingly, every male gaze in the room locked onto her the moment she appeared.

Yet despite her stunning appearance, these were industry titans accustomed to substance over style. They wouldn't tolerate an unqualified woman occupying such a crucial position. As the initial awe faded, murmurs of discontent rippled through the crowd.

"Isn't that Blackwood's ex-wife? Did she get lost on her way to the divorce support group?"

"Have standards fallen so low that they're picking directors off the street now? This is an insult to our industry!"

The host shifted uncomfortably as waves of skepticism threatened to derail the event.

"Please," the host implored, raising his hands for quiet. "Ms. Lockhart has met every qualification for this position. Her credentials are impeccable - with degrees from Stanford and Cambridge, plus numerous publications in prestigious journals worldwide. We've been blind to her accomplishments, seeing only 'Mrs. Blackwood' until now."

He paused for emphasis. "Most importantly, she's the primary investor behind this summit and was personally selected by Mr. Y as director. That endorsement speaks volumes."

The mention of Mr. Y's involvement silenced the crowd instantly. If the legendary investor stood behind her, perhaps there was more to this woman than met the eye.

Vivian's lips curved into a composed smile as she lifted the microphone. "I understand your skepticism. You see a discarded wife, a woman you assume has nothing to offer beyond her failed marriage." Her voice gained strength. "But I'll prove every one of your assumptions wrong through my work and vision."

Then she launched into her inaugural address.

"Chip technology represents both the cornerstone of our industry and its greatest challenge, particularly in semiconductor and microparticle development..."

Her words flowed with the precision of a seasoned expert. Though many had tuned in expecting a trainwreck, they soon found themselves captivated by her insightful analysis and commanding presence.

Nathaniel's intense focus never wavered from Vivian. With every gesture, every nuanced expression, she revealed facets he'd never noticed during their marriage. The woman on that podium might as well have been a stranger - brilliant, confident, and utterly mesmerizing.

Though mere feet separated them, an ocean might as well have stretched between where he sat and where she stood, radiant under the stage lights.

The thunderous ovation that followed her speech left no doubt - Vivian Lockhart had claimed her rightful place as director.

Meanwhile, at the venue's periphery, Julian Blackwood leaned casually against the exit wall. Half his striking face remained shadowed beneath his mask, but his lips curled in quiet satisfaction.

His gamble had paid off beyond expectations. This woman was a diamond in the rough - and Nathaniel's loss would prove to be his greatest advantage.
###Chapter 137

Vivian Lockhart became an overnight sensation after the summit forum, despite being virtually unknown before.

She was now the darling of the tech world. People flocked to her, eager for photos and conversation, as if nothing else mattered.

Traditionally, the summit's conclusion was marked by a grand banquet attended by industry elites. Naturally, Ethan Blackwood and Vivian were both expected to attend.

They sat at the same table, but several people separated them.

Though they had once been intimately close as husband and wife, not a single word passed between them. Not even a glance.

In truth, Vivian didn’t spare Ethan a single look. Ethan, however, couldn’t take his eyes off her—his infamous "Blackwood Stare" locked onto her the entire evening.

With a glass in hand and effortless charm, Vivian mingled with industry titans like she’d been doing it for years. There was no trace of the timid, submissive woman she’d once been.

Ethan’s expression remained dark throughout the meal, his icy demeanor warning others to stay away. Anyone who dared approach him with congratulations or a toast quickly retreated under his piercing glare.

The banquet hall became a study in contrasts—one side lively with laughter and conversation around Vivian, the other silent and tense around Ethan.

Ethan Young stood behind his boss, equally captivated by Vivian.

"Mr. Blackwood," he murmured, "I never knew Mrs. Blackwood had this side to her. A tech genius and a master networker? How did we miss this?"

Ethan’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing.

"Remember when you said the new association director would blacklist Lockhart Enterprises?" Ethan Young continued, oblivious. "Now we should be grateful if she doesn’t blacklist us. Talk about a power move."

Ethan shot him a look that could freeze hell. "If you can’t use that tongue wisely, I’ll have it removed."

Undeterred, Ethan Young pressed on. "Sir, swallow your pride and remarry her. She’s not the woman who used to hide indoors anymore. She’s the director of the Tech Association now. Together, you’d be unstoppable."

Ethan remained silent, but his gaze burned into Vivian. The Blackwoods ruled Harborview City’s elite. Blackwood Group was untouchable. He didn’t need a wife for power.

Yet the thought of her surrounded by other men made his blood boil.

He wanted to drag her home and keep her away from them all.

The intensity of his possessiveness startled even him.

Misreading his silence as agreement, Ethan Young cleared his throat and called out, "Ms. Lockhart! Mr. Blackwood would like a word with you—in private!"

Vivian was deep in conversation with the Minister of Technology and other key figures. At Ethan Young’s words, her smile vanished.

She swirled her orange juice, then turned to Ethan with an unreadable expression.

"An invitation from Mr. Blackwood himself?" Her voice was cool, measured. "How could I refuse?"
###Chapter 138

Nathaniel Blackwood lounged like a king on his throne, his smirk dripping with condescension as he eyed the champagne flute in Vivian Lockhart's hand. The glass sparkled with fresh orange juice instead of alcohol.

"Is this how you demonstrate commitment to our industry?" His voice cut through the air like a whip.

"Commitment shows in actions," Vivian countered sharply, "not in beverages."

She turned gracefully to the assembled executives, her tone softening. "Gentlemen, my apologies for the unconventional choice. A medical condition prevents me from consuming alcohol tonight. Please know this in no way reflects my respect for each of you."

"Juice at a business function?" Nathaniel's laugh held no warmth. "This isn't kindergarten, Ms. Lockhart. The corporate world eats weaklings alive. If you can't handle basic networking, perhaps you should resign now."

The room's atmosphere shifted instantly. Powerful men exchanged glances, calculating which side to choose. Like sharks scenting blood, they turned on Vivian.

"Mr. Blackwood speaks truth! Who drinks juice at these events? Are you mocking us?"

"That directorship position isn't just for show. Did you expect special treatment because you're a woman?"

"If you can't handle alcohol, how will you handle boardroom battles? Maybe you're not cut out for this role."

Nathaniel swirled his bourbon, satisfaction curling his lips. His gaze pinned Vivian like a butterfly to corkboard - something fragile meant for display, not the battlefield.

Vivian's nails bit into her palm. Of course Nathaniel would weaponize this moment. The irony burned - normally she could drink most men under the table. But the tiny life growing inside her changed everything.

'Challenge accepted,' she thought, fury simmering beneath her calm exterior.

"You're absolutely right, Mr. Blackwood. My oversight was unprofessional." Vivian drained her juice in one smooth motion, then reached for the whiskey decanter. She poured two fingers of amber liquid, her eyes never leaving Nathaniel's. "But where's the fun in simple drinking? Let's make it interesting - a quick round of quarters. You win, I'll drink whatever you pour."

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Nathaniel's expression frosted over. The CEO of Blackwood Group didn't play bar games - especially not with his ex-wife.

"Suddenly shy?" Vivian taunted, tilting her head. "Or are you afraid to lose to a woman? If so, maybe you're the one unfit for business."

Gasps echoed. The tension crackled like live wires. Onlookers wondered if this was hostility... or some twisted foreplay between former spouses.

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around his glass. "You really want to do this?"

"Absolutely. And the loser grants any request - no limits. Still game?"

"Fine." Nathaniel rolled up his sleeves, revealing muscular forearms. "Don't come crying to me later."

Elijah Young nearly choked on his drink. Since when did Nathaniel indulge in drinking games? And with Vivian Lockhart of all people? If this wasn't love, what was?

Still, he leaned toward his boss. "Perhaps go easy, sir? Ms. Lockhart seems... inexperienced at this."

Vivian batted her eyelashes. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood. Be gentle with me."

Internally, she smirked. 'Time to wipe that arrogant smirk off your face, Nathaniel.'
###Chapter 139

"If you're truly allergic to alcohol," Ethan Blackwood sneered at Vivian Lockhart, "it's not too late to back out."

His only goal was to make her realize the impossible challenge of her new role and surrender—not to actually hurt her.

But Vivian kept up her act as the fragile damsel, batting her lashes. "It's fine. I just want to prove my sincerity to everyone here."

Foolish, stubborn woman. His patience snapped. Ethan tilted his chin up, voice sharp. "Then let's begin."

The crowd held their breath, instinctively stepping back to watch the showdown unfold.

They chose the simplest version of the drinking game. Truthfully, Ethan—ever the disciplined CEO—rarely indulged in such frivolities. The only times he'd played were during casual gatherings with Nathan Prescott and Dominic Harrington. He knew he wasn't exceptional at it, but surely he could crush an inexperienced girl like Vivian without effort.

To everyone's shock, Vivian held her ground unnervingly well.

"Five!"

"Fifteen!"

"Twenty!"

The tension escalated with each round. Ethan's brows furrowed as he forced himself to focus entirely on the game.

"Five!"

Vivian held up five fingers on one hand and a clenched fist on the other. Ethan had both fists raised.

She clapped in delight, laughing like she'd just won a carnival prize. "Sorry, Mr. Blackwood. You lose! Drink up!"

"I lost?" Ethan blinked, disoriented.

Seconds ago, he'd been debating whether to go easy on her. Now, he'd been defeated?

The spectators exchanged stunned glances but stayed silent. No one dared point out how humiliating it was for a man of his stature to lose to a woman in a drinking game.

Expressionless, Ethan motioned for Ethan Young to refill his glass. He downed it in one gulp and growled, "Again."

Vivian bit back a smirk, playing the grateful innocent. "You're such a gentleman, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you for going easy on me earlier, but let's both get serious now. No more holding back."

Ethan's jaw tightened. Coincidence. That's all it was. He just needed to concentrate.

Round two began.

This time, his defeat came even faster—just two turns.

"Another glass, Mr. Blackwood."

They played a third round. A fourth. A fifth.

By now, Ethan's losses were expected.

Though he had a high alcohol tolerance, nearly emptying the decanter left his head spinning.

Even Vivian grew weary. She stifled a yawn. "Should we stop? Any more and you'll be drunk."

"No." His voice was rough, frustration simmering. "We continue."

Resigned, Vivian obliged. She'd guessed Ethan might be bad at this, but not this bad. His life, like the man himself, was clearly devoid of fun. It was obvious he'd never frequented bars or clubs—hence his pitiful skills.

Vivian wasn't a partygoer either, but her best friend Sophia Osborne had dragged her out enough times that she'd mastered drinking games.

If she could actually drink, she might've let him win just to appease his competitive pride and escape early.

As Ethan drained the last of the wine, Vivian addressed the room. "Everyone witnessed Mr. Blackwood's loss. I hope he'll honor our agreement—the loser grants the winner one request."

She turned to Ethan, voice soft but steel-edged. "My request is simple: Stay out of my business. No more interference in my career. From now on, we compete fairly. Let's meet again at the top."

With that, she grabbed her purse and turned to leave.

"Leaving so soon?" Ethan's towering frame blocked her path. He yanked at his tie, radiating danger. Even drunk, his gaze remained predatory—a wolf cornering its prey.
###Chapter 140

"What more do you want from me?"

Vivian stared into Ethan's glassy eyes, the memory of that night flooding back—when he'd cornered her just like this, his dominance leaving no room for refusal. And then, afterward? He'd acted as if nothing had happened between them. That cowardly retreat, that refusal to acknowledge what they'd shared—it infuriated her beyond reason.

"Since I've clearly won," she said, her voice sharp as ice, "I don't owe you another second of my time while you act like a petulant child. Accept your loss gracefully and stop wasting mine."

The anger she'd suppressed for so long finally boiled over. Without a backward glance, she turned on her heel and strode out, her expression colder than the winter wind.

Ethan stood frozen, as if she'd slapped him. For a long moment, he didn’t move, his face an unreadable mask of icy detachment.

The tension in the room was suffocating. The guests exchanged uneasy glances, stunned into silence. The Vivian Lockhart they'd heard about was supposed to be meek, refined—the perfect society wife. But the woman who had just stormed out? She was a force of nature.

In all of Newport City, who else would dare challenge Ethan Blackwood so boldly? Was this sheer audacity, or did she truly believe she was untouchable because of his lingering affection?

Ethan Young knew his boss was drunk. And drunk Ethan was a nightmare. History had proven that. Before things escalated, he quickly dismissed the guests with a strained smile. If Ethan lost control in front of them, his reputation would be in ruins.

The guests, sensing the danger, murmured their goodbyes and slipped out without protest.

One older gentleman, wise enough to recognize a man drowning in pride, clapped Ethan on the shoulder. "Don't let her walk away, Mr. Blackwood. If she's running, you chase. That's how it's always been."

"Chase her?" Ethan scoffed, swaying dangerously. "Never! I wouldn’t take her back even if she begged on her knees!"

Ethan Young guided him into a chair, sighing. "You're drunk, sir. Let me take you home."

"I'm not drunk!" Ethan snapped, jabbing a finger at the empty decanter. "Get another bottle. And drag Vivian back here. I will beat her tonight!"

"Sir," Ethan Young said, wiping his brow, "Mrs. Lockhart is gone. Everyone’s left. The dinner is over. Let’s just go home."

Ethan blinked, scanning the empty room. "Fine. Then we’re going out."

He pushed himself up, staggering toward the door.

Ethan Young caught him before he face-planted. "It's late, sir. You need rest."

"Rest?" Ethan whirled on him, eyes blazing. "I'm Ethan Blackwood. I don’t need rest. I’m going to party until dawn!"

Ethan Young rubbed his temples. Here we go again.

"Take me to the usual place," Ethan demanded. "You know where."

Half an hour later, they arrived at an upscale karaoke lounge. The manager led them to the VIP room, smirking. "Would you like some company, gentlemen? We have very talented escorts."

"Just bring snacks and drinks," Ethan Young snapped.

The manager glanced at the barely coherent Ethan, then back at him, suddenly understanding. "Ah. Of course. But just so you know, we cater to all preferences here. Don’t hesitate to ask."

"Get out!" Ethan Young nearly threw a chair at him.

When he turned back, Ethan was sprawled on the couch, having queued up a hundred songs. He pointed at the screen. "Sing with me."

Ethan Young prayed for divine intervention.

Every time his boss got drunk, karaoke was inevitable. But a hundred songs? At this rate, Ethan would lose his voice before sunrise.

No. This had to stop. Now.
###Chapter 141

Ethan Young barely suppressed his laughter the moment he saw the playlist.

Nathaniel Blackwood's first choice was "Love Drowned in Tears." The second track? "Our Love is Dead." And the third? "Too Late for Goodbyes."

Every single selection screamed heartbreak, regret, and doomed romance.

Clearly, Vivian Lockhart had dealt Nathaniel a crushing blow today.

The man who always prided himself on logic and control was now revealing his true colors - drunk and emotionally wrecked.

Only the woman who caused this meltdown could fix it. Vivian alone could save him from this pathetic karaoke spiral.

After enduring three agonizing duets, Ethan made his escape. "Keep singing, Mr. Blackwood. Nature calls."

He bolted for the restroom, phone in hand.

Nathaniel didn't even glance his way, too busy crooning into the microphone with glassy-eyed intensity.

Locked in a bathroom stall, Ethan dialed Vivian's number. "Madam! Emergency! Your husband's losing his mind!"

Vivian lounged in her bubble bath, phone balanced on the edge. "Not my problem," she said flatly. "Don't call me again." The line went dead.

Ethan cursed. He'd forgotten she'd blocked Nathaniel's number but not his. Rookie mistake.

A quick text with the karaoke bar's address: "You're underestimating his feelings, Madam."

Vivian powered off her phone. The warm water suddenly felt stifling. She remembered Nathaniel's drunken state when she left - worse than she'd ever seen him, except that one reckless night.

What if he actually hurt himself? Even if it wasn't about her, she'd still bear some responsibility...

With a frustrated groan, she toweled off and threw on jeans and a hoodie.

Meanwhile, Ethan remained perched on the toilet seat. He was betting everything on Vivian's lingering feelings. No way would she resist checking on Nathaniel, no matter what she claimed.

Going back out now would make him the world's most awkward third wheel. Better to wait here until Vivian arrived.

At the karaoke bar's entrance, Vivian told the manager, "I'm looking for your most attractive customer."

The man grinned. "We've got one godlike specimen, but he's... occupied."

"Occupied how? Attempting suicide?"

The manager chuckled. "Check Lounge V1 yourself. And if you need... company, we cater to all preferences."

Vivian's confusion grew as she approached the private room. From down the hall, she heard off-key wailing and raucous laughter. Her hands clenched into fists. Elijah would pay for this.

This was no suicide watch - this was a damn party.

She shoved the door open - and froze.

"Nathaniel Blackwood! What the hell is this?"
###Chapter 142

The dim lighting of the VIP lounge cast long shadows across the room. Vivian didn't just spot Nathaniel—he was surrounded by a group of strikingly handsome young men, each dressed to impress in their own unique style.

They were all vying for his attention, using every trick in the book.

"Ahem!" Vivian cleared her throat awkwardly, suddenly feeling like an intruder.

Nathaniel hadn't noticed her yet. He was too engrossed in singing a melancholic ballad called "Ten Years Ago" into the microphone clutched in his hand.

"Ten years ago..." His deep voice filled the room. "I didn't know you, and you weren't mine..."

Vivian had planned to leave immediately, but something about his voice rooted her to the spot.

Despite being married to him for years, she'd never heard him sing before.

The man who was always so controlled, so unreadable, was pouring raw emotion into every word. His voice was rich and hypnotic, but what stunned her more was the pain laced through each lyric—as if he'd lived through heartbreak himself.

But who could have broken Nathaniel Blackwood's heart?

His first love, Olivia Sinclair, who was about to marry his best friend? The elusive Mr. Y? Or perhaps Cassandra Delacroix, now carrying his child?

One thing was certain—it wasn't her.

Satisfied that Nathaniel wasn't in any real danger, Vivian turned to slip away unnoticed.

Then disaster struck.

One of the men on the couch gasped dramatically, pointing at her. "Oh my god! Who's that woman? She's been watching us!"

The music cut off abruptly. Nathaniel's head snapped toward the door, his alcohol-hazed eyes locking onto Vivian.

For a long moment, he just stared. His expression was unreadable—not angry, not welcoming. He didn't tell her to leave, but he didn't invite her in either.

The tension grew unbearable.

Vivian forced a polite smile at the group. "Don't mind me. Please, carry on."

She meant to walk away then. But something stopped her.

If the press caught wind of Nathaniel Blackwood in this state, it would be front-page news by morning.

Like it or not, he was still the father of her children.

Decision made, Vivian squared her shoulders and strode into the lounge with purpose.

"I've changed my mind," she announced. "I'm taking him home tonight."
###Chapter 143

Vivian strode forward with purpose, stopping inches from the karaoke stage where Ethan sat surrounded by giggling escorts. She fixed her gaze on the pretty boy currently sharing his microphone.

"Move," she commanded, pointing to the empty spot beside Ethan. "That's my seat."

The young man—clearly the bar's top-paid entertainer—barely glanced up from the screen. His practiced smirk didn't waver as he adjusted his glittery headset. "Get a number, sweetheart. I don't care if you're the queen of England—this spot's taken."

Vivian's nails dug into her palms. "I'm his ex-wife."

That earned her a dramatic eye-roll. The escort draped himself possessively over Ethan's shoulder. "And I'm tonight's entertainment. Unless you plan on singing Whitney Houston, scram."

She gaped at his audacity. Since when did karaoke hustlers develop this level of attitude?

The boy snapped his fingers near her face. "Hello? Earth to bitter ex-wife? We're trying to enjoy our private time here." His voice dripped with exaggerated sweetness, each syllable pitched higher than the last.

Vivian recoiled. That falsetto could shatter glass.

Ethan chose that moment to lurch upright, nearly toppling the cocktail table. His whiskey-glazed eyes locked onto Vivian like she was the only steady thing in the spinning room.

Before she could react, his hands framed her face—hot, rough palms cradling her cheeks with startling gentleness. Then he squished her features together like playdough.

"Ethan Blackwood, I swear to god—"

"You're real," he murmured, thumbs smoothing over the apples of her cheeks. A drunk, beatific smile spread across his face. "Not another dream."

The microphone hit her chest with a thud.

"Sing."

Vivian stared at the device now clutched in her fingers. On screen, the opening notes of "The Outside World" began playing—a song she hadn't heard since their honeymoon.

The remaining escorts vanished with one sharp look from Ethan. Suddenly it was just them, the neon lights, and three years of unsaid words hanging between the lyrics.

His calloused fingers brushed hers as he adjusted the mic. "Please."

That single word undid her. It carried the same raw vulnerability as that drunken night months ago, when he'd whispered confessions against her skin.

Vivian stepped back, heart hammering. "Do you even remember what happened last time?"

The song's chorus swelled around them, the answer hanging in the charged silence.
###Chapter 144

Vivian could feel Ethan's warm breath against her skin.

His exhales carried the heavy scent of whiskey. With glassy eyes, he tilted her chin up with his fingers.

"What really happened that night?"

Her brows furrowed in suspicion.

"Are you genuinely clueless, or just avoiding accountability?"

"Enlighten me," Ethan rasped. His tone was teasing yet unreadable. "Maybe your version will jog my memory."

"That night—" Vivian bit back the words. The truth burned on her tongue, but she swallowed it down.

Even when drunk, she always remembered fragments of her actions. Complete blackouts were rare.

Which meant Ethan's claimed amnesia was either a lie... or deliberate.

If he wanted to forget, she wouldn't humiliate herself by reminding him.

"You were feral," she spat. "Like a rabid wolf."

Her beauty was sharp as ice as she sneered, "Know your limits next time. Can't handle liquor? Don't drink. Using intoxication as an excuse for bad behavior is pathetic."

Ethan studied her, baffled. He couldn't pinpoint her anger, but the resentment was palpable.

The irony? She'd publicly humiliated him that evening. He'd let it slide, yet here she was, furious at him.

Were all women this irrational?

As Vivian turned to leave, alcohol loosened his reflexes. He yanked her back against his chest.

"Stay," he murmured into her hair.

Predictable. The same tired line.

But Vivian wasn't that gullible girl anymore. Her heart was a frozen lake—untouched by his warmth.

"Release me." Her voice could frost glass.

Ethan only tightened his grip.

"I said let go, Nathaniel Blackwood!"

"Keep holding me," she warned, "and I won't hesitate to break your arms."

Silence.

Just as Vivian prepared to strike, she heard it—steady breathing.

He'd fallen asleep.

Worse? His arms were steel bands, trapping her.

After futile struggles, fury boiled over.

"Stop pretending!" she hissed. "I know you're awake! Let go or I swear I'll bite you!"

Her teeth hovered over his forearm... then hesitated.

Enter Ethan Young—fashionably inconvenient.

"Oh god, my bad!"

He shielded his eyes dramatically, peeking through his fingers at their compromising position.

"Terrible timing," he stammered. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Lockhart, don't mind me! Carry on!"

"Ethan!" Vivian barked. "Get back here!"

Relief flooded her as he paused. "Thank heavens! Pry your boss off me—NOW!"

She glared. "He passed out standing up. The man's unhinged!"

Ethan inspected them. His boss did seem asleep... yet the death grip suggested otherwise.

Natural actor, indeed.

He made a show of tugging at Ethan's arms. No luck.

"Mrs. Lockhart," he admitted sheepishly, "when drunk, Mr. Blackwood latches onto anything—lampposts, chairs. We call him 'Newport City's Koala.'"

He flashed an apologetic grin. "Mind staying like this while I drive you home?"

"Are you joking?" Vivian's face darkened. "Explain how this position is sustainable for a car ride, Ethan!"

Outrageous. Absolutely outrageous.
###Chapter 145

Ethan adjusted his glasses with practiced ease, delivering his fabricated explanation to Vivian. "You might find this hard to believe, Mrs. Lockhart, but my boss has a peculiar habit when he's drunk."

His tone was smooth, rehearsed. "He clings to the nearest person like a life preserver. And trust me, you're not the first."

A conspiratorial smile played on his lips. "I've handled this situation enough times to know what works. Just bear with him a little longer."

The lie rolled off his tongue effortlessly. The sober Nathaniel Blackwood would never debase himself like this—too proud, too controlled. But Ethan knew desperate times called for desperate measures.

Vivian Lockhart wasn't just any woman. Director of the Tech Innovation Board, sharp as a blade. If Nathaniel wanted her back, he needed to play dirty.

Against all odds, Vivian bought it.

"Fine," she relented, irritation lacing her voice. "But hurry up."

She glanced at Nathaniel, his arms locked around her like steel bands, his breathing deep and even against her neck. The familiarity of it sent an unwelcome pang through her chest.

This wasn't the first time.

That night years ago flashed in her mind—his grip just as unyielding, his warmth just as intoxicating. The memory burned.

If she'd known then what she knew now, she'd have thrown the whiskey bottle out the window before letting him take a single sip.

The trio exited the karaoke bar in a ridiculous procession—Nathaniel glued to Vivian, Ethan propping him up like a human crutch.

The cab ride was torture. Nathaniel's hold didn't loosen, no matter how much Vivian squirmed. "Drive faster," she snapped at the driver.

Blackwood Estate loomed ahead. Four years she'd called this place home. Now it was just a gilded cage she never wanted to step foot in again.

Inside, the scene was equally nauseating.

Cassandra Delacroix, heavily pregnant, was mid-performance in the grand parlor, her tear-streaked face turned toward Eleanor Whitmore. "Aunt Eleanor, I try—I really do—but Nathaniel's never home!" Her voice quivered. "How can we bond when he avoids me?"

Eleanor's frown deepened. "You're right. My son has always been... stubborn." She sighed. "But with the baby coming, we may need to postpone the engagement."

Cassandra's gasp was theatrical. "Postpone? My child can't be born a bastard!"

Eleanor's lips thinned. She wasn't fooled by Cassandra's act—the girl had shown her true colors when she thought Nathaniel was paralyzed. But the baby was Blackwood blood. That couldn't be ignored.

The front door swung open.

Silence.

Every eye locked onto the spectacle in the foyer—Nathaniel wrapped around Vivian like ivy, Ethan grinning like an idiot.

"Mrs. Whitmore!" Ethan chirped. "What excellent timing!"

Vivian wanted to strangle him. No one on earth was better at creating catastrophically awkward moments than Ethan Young.

Eleanor's face purpled. "What is the meaning of this?!"

"Ask your son," Vivian shot back.

She glared at the frozen onlookers. "Well? Are you just going to stand there?"
###Chapter 146

Margaret Whitmore's shrill voice cut through the tense air. "You divorced Nathaniel, yet you still cling to him like some desperate groupie. How dare you show your face at Blackwood Estate!"

Ethan Young opened his mouth to intervene, but Vivian Lockhart was faster. Her eyes flashed with cold fury. "Open your eyes, Eleanor. Your son's the one who can't let go. Maybe if you'd raised him better, he wouldn't be such a pathetic drunk."

Eleanor Whitmore's face turned purple with rage. "How dare—"

"I tolerated your insults when I was your daughter-in-law," Vivian continued, voice like shards of ice. "But now? One more word and I'll sue you for defamation."

She shoved against Nathaniel's chest, but his arms remained locked around her like steel bands. The man was infuriatingly strong for someone who could barely stand.

"Enough games, Nathaniel," she hissed, fist clenching. "Let go or I'll break your nose."

Across the room, Cassandra Delacroix dug her manicured nails into her palms. The sight of Nathaniel clinging to his ex-wife made her blood boil.

Ethan rushed to explain. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Blackwood got drunk and refused to release Miss Lockhart. She came here out of concern—"

"Lies!" Eleanor whirled on Cassandra. "Stop gawking and help me separate them! Can't even keep your fiancé from his ex?"

Three servants rushed forward. After considerable struggle, they pried Nathaniel loose.

"Vivian...don't go..." Nathaniel slurred, reaching blindly. "Dangerous...come back..."

Cassandra seized her chance. She caught his swaying body and whispered, "I'm here, darling."

To Vivian's disgust, Nathaniel embraced Cassandra with the same drunken fervor. "Good...stay..."

Cassandra shot Vivian a triumphant smirk. "My apologies for the trouble. Nathaniel gets...affectionate when intoxicated. I'll take care of him."

Vivian's expression remained impassive, though something twisted in her chest. So much for being special. The great Nathaniel Blackwood would grope any warm body within reach.

"Control your man," she said coldly. "Next time he harasses me, I'm filing a restraining order."

Without another glance, she turned on her heel and walked out, the slam of the front door echoing like a gunshot.
###Chapter 147

Vivian left without looking back.

Cassandra smirked in satisfaction, adjusting her grip on the intoxicated Ethan. "Mrs. Whitmore," she said to Eleanor, "I'll take Ethan to his room now. By morning, our engagement will be undeniable."

Eleanor gave a curt nod. "Good. Don't waste this chance."

She might not have approved of Cassandra, but compared to Vivian, the girl was at least obedient. Tonight had to seal Ethan's fate before Vivian could interfere again.

Nearby, Ethan's secretary, Ethan Young, shifted uneasily. Something wasn't right.

He couldn't fathom why Vivian would willingly hand Ethan over to someone like Cassandra.

Did Mrs. Blackwood truly stop loving him? If so, Mr. Blackwood is walking into disaster.

"Ethan, let's get you to bed," Cassandra cooed, sliding an arm around his waist.

Suddenly, Ethan shoved her away, his voice icy. "Don't touch me. You're not her."

Cassandra blinked. "Ethan... are you sober?"

No response. His body swayed slightly, his gaze unfocused. Still drunk, then.

Ethan Young seized the moment, stepping between them. "Miss Delacroix, you don't understand Mr. Blackwood's habits. He despises being handled when he's like this—especially by women. I'll take care of him."

Cassandra's smile tightened. The secretary was treating her like a fool.

"Really?" She laughed sharply. "Then why did he cling to Mrs. Lockhart earlier? And how, exactly, did I get pregnant if he hates being touched?"

Ethan Young's expression didn't waver. "Your pregnancy is your business, Miss Delacroix. As for Mr. Blackwood and Mrs. Lockhart—they were married for years. Some habits die hard. Unlike strangers who force themselves where they don't belong."

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "Watch your tone."

"You're the one panicking," he countered coolly.

She scoffed. "You defend a divorced woman so fiercely. Do you want her for yourself?"

A secretary was beneath her concern. Once she became Mrs. Blackwood, he'd be the first fired.

Ethan Young merely smiled.

Eleanor cut in, her voice like steel. "Enough. You will not disrespect Mr. Young again, or you'll regret it."

Cassandra flinched, falling silent.

Oddly, Ethan didn't resist his secretary's touch. No childish tantrums like with Vivian earlier. He simply allowed himself to be guided upstairs.

In the bedroom, Ethan Young eased him onto the bed.

A whisper slipped from Ethan's lips. "Vivian... Come back. That's an order. No one protects you but me."

Ethan Young sighed. "Mr. Blackwood, you pushed her away when she loved you. Now that she's gone, you chase her. Why make everything so difficult?"
###Chapter 148

Ethan Blackwood woke with a skull-splitting headache.

His vision cleared to reveal Ethan Young perched on a chair, watching him with concern.

"Mr. Blackwood, you're conscious at last. My duty here is complete."

Relief washed over Ethan Young's face. He'd been on high alert all night.

The memory of Vivian Lockhart's lingering gaze had kept him vigilant. That woman would pounce given half a chance.

Ethan Blackwood massaged his temples, struggling to piece together last night's events.

Flashes of drinking games with Vivian surfaced. Nothing more.

"Was I intoxicated?" His voice turned icy. "Impossible. I never lose control."

Ethan Young barely suppressed an eye roll.

This was textbook behavior. Blackwood always denied his drunken escapades. Normally, he kept the man from excess.

But Vivian had outmaneuvered them both.

"Of course not, sir," Ethan Young deadpanned. "You merely... lost all dignity."

"Preposterous!"

Ethan Blackwood's pride flared. "I know my limits."

The secretary's lips twitched. The man's delusional arrogance never ceased.

Without evidence, even he might doubt last night's spectacle.

"Do you truly recall nothing?" Ethan Young probed.

"Vivian left after beating me at that absurd game. You brought me home."

"That's the sanitized version." Ethan Young leaned forward. "Shall I describe how you dragged us to karaoke? How you screamed lyrics like a banshee? How you clung to Mrs. Blackwood like a limpet?"

Ethan Blackwood's expression darkened. "Lies."

The karaoke humiliation he could believe - it had precedent.

But begging Vivian to stay? Unthinkable. He despised physical contact, especially with her.

Ethan Young produced his phone with theatrical flair. "Then behold your disgrace."

The video showed Ethan Blackwood wrapped around Vivian like human ivy. Staff struggled to pry him loose as he whimpered pathetic pleas.

"Erase that immediately!"

Heat crawled up Ethan Blackwood's neck. This couldn't be real.

"Ah... about that." Ethan Young winced. "It may have briefly appeared on our corporate site before I removed it. Potentially downloaded."

"WHAT?!"

Ethan Blackwood's roar rattled the windows.
###Chapter 149

Today marked Vivian Lockhart's official departure from Sunrise Heights.

Though primarily to avoid her ex-husband Nathaniel Blackwood, she'd fantasized about this moment for four years.

Her new home would be Lockhart Manor.

After the Lockhart family's bankruptcy four years ago, their three-story estate had been seized and auctioned.

But rumors of tragic deaths within its walls kept buyers away, despite the bargain price.

When it reappeared at auction last week, Vivian didn't hesitate. She secured it for 1.5 billion.

Only Sophia Osborne and Liam Osborne knew about her purchase. Both insisted on throwing a housewarming party, with Sophia promising to bring a surprise guest.

Vivian agreed immediately. The abandoned manor needed life breathed back into its hollow halls.

Packing took little time—she'd never truly settled into Nathaniel's space.

One final glance at the penthouse door brought a bitter smile.

"Probably discussing wedding plans with Cassandra right now," she mused.

Her rushed exit seemed almost silly in hindsight. Nathaniel clearly couldn't care less.

A sharp inhale. A firm shake of her head. The past would stay buried.

After today, their only connection might be as business rivals. Nothing more.

The car wound through Newport City's glittering center before reaching the secluded western outskirts.

Locals said the elite flourished in the west, the ambitious in the south, the struggling in the north, and danger lurked in the east.

The west's tree-lined streets hid generational wealth—old money families, political dynasties, descendants of royalty. New money rarely gained entry.

Vivian's grandfather had been a decorated general. Her grandmother's origins remained mysterious, though whispers tied her to European nobility.

At their peak, the Lockharts rivaled the Elite Eight's wealth. They chose the west deliberately.

Then came the crash.

Now weeds choked the once-manicured grounds. Dust blanketed every surface. Cobwebs draped like ghostly curtains.

The derelict sight twisted Vivian's heart, but she squared her shoulders. This house would shine again.

Everything was proceeding smoothly until the cleaning service canceled last minute.

Panic fluttered in her chest.

The exterior appeared structurally sound, but the interior likely needed extensive work.

Her original housekeeper refused the job—too much for one person.

Five more services declined upon hearing the address, each inventing increasingly ridiculous excuses.

"That place is cursed! The Lockhart ghosts wail all night!"

After the sixth rejection, Vivian frowned. Were her parents truly trapped here?

The thought didn't frighten her.

She'd give anything to see them again.

The car halted before the wrought-iron gates. Vivian stepped out immediately.

The estate felt simultaneously familiar and foreign.

Rust devoured the fencing. Weeds stood waist-high where roses once bloomed.

Tears streaked down Vivian's face.

"Grandfather. Mother. Father. I'm home," she whispered.

As she reached for the gate, movement caught her eye. Something... unexpected.
###Chapter 150

Vivian spotted the broken iron fence immediately. A patch of tall grass lay trampled, fresh footprints imprinted in the damp earth.

Someone had been here before her.

The disturbing part? The tracks led inside but never came back out.

That meant whoever entered was still in there.

Behind her, the movers dropped her luggage with a thud. The man wiped his brow, eyes darting nervously toward the house.

"Miss Lockhart, your things are here. I...I won't be going in. Take my advice—leave this place while you still can."

Vivian turned, studying his pale face. "What's wrong with this house? Everyone acts like it's cursed."

The man swallowed hard, stealing a terrified glance at the darkened windows. "You haven't heard? The owners...they died here. Their spirits never left. This place is haunted!"

"I know about the tragedy, but ghosts? That's just superstition."

"No!" He shook violently. "I've seen her myself! Delivering packages last winter—the lady in white weeping at the upstairs window. If I wasn't desperate for money..."

Before finishing, he bolted to his truck. "Good luck! Don't you dare give me a bad review!"

Vivian barely registered his panic. Truthfully? She hoped to encounter the famous ghost.

Right now, she had a more pressing mystery—who was hiding in her childhood home?

She pulled a baseball bat from her bag, pushed through the creaking gate.

Memories assaulted her instantly. The overgrown garden where sunflowers once towered. The rusted swing her father built—still standing after all these years.

Tears pricked her eyes as she stepped onto the porch.

Then—BOOM!

Rainbow confetti exploded around her.

"Surprise!"

Vivian barely stopped herself from swinging the bat. Nathan stood grinning with a sunflower bouquet while Sophia emerged holding a cake.

"Congratulations on ditching that bastard Ethan!" Sophia beamed. "Your life starts today!"

Nathan looked uncharacteristically solemn as he offered the flowers. The intensity in his gaze might've been mistaken for a proposal.

Sunflowers—her favorite. Golden blooms that chased sunlight, just like she chased life.

Not to be outdone, Sophia thrust the cake forward. "Homemade! It'll cleanse all that bad juju away!"

Vivian's vision blurred with tears.

Then she noticed—no dust. No cobwebs. The house gleamed, smelling of lemon polish and fresh linens.

"You cleaned too? I'm making dinner to thank—"

"Wrong!" Sophia giggled. "Trust me, neither of us would scrub floors. Especially not Mr. Lazy here."

"Then who?"

Sophia smirked toward the staircase. "Come out already!"
###Chapter 151

A strikingly attractive man descended the staircase, his tailored CK suit hugging his frame perfectly.

"Julian!"

Vivian's breath caught in her throat.

He'd vanished after releasing her that night when he'd kept her Scarlet Phoenix identity secret from Nathaniel.

She'd assumed he'd gone back to Alpine Springs.

His sudden reappearance in her home, helping with chores, could only mean one thing - ulterior motives.

"That devastated expression tells me I'm not welcome."

Pausing midway down the steps, Julian gazed down at Vivian with a devilish smirk. "I've been working nonstop since noon. My back might snap in two. You'll have to take responsibility if that happens."

Vivian's cheeks burned.

Who knew the genius hacker could be such a flirt?

"Enough gloating. Get down here!"

Theodore's glare could have melted steel. "Nothing you do comes without strings attached. Only my sister's request made me tolerate your presence in Lockhart Manor!"

Julian arched an eyebrow mockingly. "Considering how much you've sacrificed for Vivian these years, I wonder what your true intentions are?"

"We're nothing alike. I'm her subordinate. She saved my life!"

"I outrank you."

Tilting his chin up, Julian displayed his razor-sharp jawline. "Scarlet Phoenix and I are the digital world's power couple. Soulmates. Comprende?"

Theodore's composure shattered. "Soulmates? Don't make me laugh! You don't even have a soul. You're unworthy of being Boss's soulmate."

"My worthiness isn't yours to judge." Julian's eyes glinted. "Scarlet's single now. We all get a shot. If you qualify, so do I."

Like oil and water, the two men resumed their bickering.

"At it again?" Sophia rolled her eyes heavenward.

They'd been sparring since morning. Verbal jabs inevitably escalated to physical ones.

Sophia regretted ever introducing them.

Both were fighting for the same woman.

"Underling or soulmate - you're both just backup to Vivian."

Sophia's blunt statement silenced them instantly.

Julian shoved hands in pockets, adopting his signature mysterious smirk. "I admire Scarlet Phoenix, but I'll never play second fiddle."

Theodore countered calmly, "It's not backup. It's unconditional devotion. Modern romance lacks such depth."

His love for Vivian had always burned fiercely.

He wore that love proudly. If others misinterpreted his dedication as being a backup, so be it.

"Quite the mental gymnast."

Julian's cynical upbringing left no room for romantic notions. Yet Theodore's bold declaration gave him pause.

"More manly than those too cowardly to confess."

Vivian frowned. "Who exactly are you referencing?"

Unrequited admirers didn't surprise her. But Julian's implication suggested someone significant.

Instead of answering, Julian toyed with his phone mysteriously. "Check Twitter's trending section. You'll find it... enlightening."
###Chapter 152

Their phones lit up simultaneously, three faces frozen in confusion.

Sophia Osborne's scream shattered the silence.

"Holy shit! Ethan Blackwood and Vivian are trending worldwide!"

Nathaniel Prescott and Dominic Harrington gaped at their screens, thumbs frozen mid-scroll.

Every trending topic screamed variations of one story: The Blackwood CEO's public meltdown.

"Look! There's video proof of Mr. Blackwood begging his ex-wife like some lovesick puppy!"

"Since when do billionaires simp this hard?"

"If even Blackwood grovels, what hope do regular guys have?"

"Step one of Operation Win Back Vivian complete!"

Each click revealed the same damning footage - Ethan clinging to Vivian like a drowning man to driftwood. The juxtaposition of his usual icy demeanor with this desperate display sent the internet into hysterics.

Memes flooded timelines. Reaction videos multiplied. The clip maintained its death grip on the number one spot.

Dominic broke first, his laughter explosive. Sophia followed seconds later, clutching her stomach.

"Boss...tell me this is deepfake comedy gold." Nathaniel wheezed. "Ice King Ethan reduced to this? Priceless."

"Game over. How can mere mortals compete with this level of public devotion?" Dominic wiped tears from his eyes.

Vivian's cheeks burned. She snatched their phones. "Delete that. Drunk Ethan latches onto anything with a pulse!"

"But he was screaming your name." Sophia's eyes glittered. "Could the great Ethan Blackwood actually have regrets?"

"Not a chance." Vivian's voice could frost glass. "This is pure revenge for losing at drinking games."

"Listen carefully." She stabbed a finger at each of them. "Ethan murders people for less. Pretend you saw nothing."

Nathaniel grinned, unrepentant. "Trending in 82 countries, Boss. That ship has sailed. Why are you blushing? He's the one who should be dying of shame. You walked away like a damn queen."

He tried reloading the video. Error 404. Every trace had vanished from the internet.

"Blackwood Group's tech division earns its keep." Julian Blackthorn smirked. "But I've got the original file. One click and the world laughs at him all over again."

Vivian's head snapped up. "How?"

"Stole it during their 0.03-second takedown window." Julian preened. "Average users couldn't download that fast. His bad luck I'm a genius."

"Fucking legend!" Sophia fist-bumped him. "When you said you'd prank Ethan to join our squad, I didn't think you'd actually deliver. Welcome to the Anti-Blackwood Alliance!"

Nathaniel, despite his reservations about Julian, extended a hand. "Anyone who humiliates Ethan gets a seat at our table."

Their three fists met in solidarity, a united front against corporate tyranny.

Vivian blinked. "Anti-Blackwood what now?"

"Protect Vivian, destroy Ethan!" Sophia chanted.

"Till our last breath!" the men echoed.

The ridiculousness warmed Vivian's chest. These weren't just employees or friends - they'd become family.

And family fought for each other.

Her fingers curled into determined fists. The Lockhart name would rise again. This time, with an army at her back.
###Chapter 153

The night air was thick with reluctance as Nathaniel and the others finally departed Lockhart Manor at Isabella's insistence.

Sophia clung to Isabella's hand, her voice trembling. "Are you absolutely certain you'll be alright here alone? This place is enormous...and the rumors about spirits..."

A soft laugh escaped Isabella's lips. "This is my home. Any ghosts here would be family - they'd never harm me."

Only after repeated assurances did they leave.

Truthfully, no specter could compare to the living nightmares Isabella had already survived.

The moment the front door closed, the mansion's temporary warmth evaporated. The musty scent of abandonment crept through the halls like an unwelcome guest.

Isabella remained unfazed.

She hummed an old lullaby as she washed dishes, her movements precise. Fresh water filled the vase where she arranged sunflowers - their golden faces a stark contrast to the decaying exterior.

Inside these walls, time had stood still for four years.

Part of her still hoped to wake and find it all a bad dream. To see her grandfather's kind eyes, hear her mother's gentle "Good morning, princess."

Night deepened.

Curled on her childhood bed, memories wrapped around her like a familiar blanket. Then - a sound shattered the silence.

From her parents' former bedroom came a woman's voice, oscillating between sobs and manic laughter. The eerie cadence raised gooseblesh on Isabella's arms.

She dismissed it as exhaustion playing tricks.

Until the voice grew louder.

"Help me...it hurts so much..."

"Come play...it's cold down here..."

Definitely not her mother's voice.

Isabella's pragmatic nature warred with primal fear. Cold sweat dotted her forehead as she yanked the covers overhead.

"Please," she whispered to the darkness, "I've done no wrong."

Abrupt silence.

Her racing heartbeat echoed in the sudden quiet. The babies stirred uncomfortably in her womb.

"Shhh," she soothed, hands cradling her belly. "Mommy's here. Nothing will hurt you."

The cramping eased.

"Pathetic," she chided herself. Living monsters had tried to break her - why fear the dead?

She threw off the covers.

A blood-curdling scream tore from her throat.

Moonlight silhouetted a floating white figure at the window - more terrifying than any horror film.

"God, please—"

Eyes squeezed shut, she recited prayers through chattering teeth. The rumors were true.

This house held more than memories.

Isabella bolted upright. She needed to leave. Now.

A chill presence materialized before her. Ghostly eyes studied her intently. Then it spoke—
###Chapter 154

"Is that really you, Miss Lockhart?"

The raspy voice grew more animated as the figure approached Vivian.

Vivian's heart pounded violently. She flailed her arms wildly. "Stay back! Or I'll call an exorcist to banish you!"

"Don't be frightened, dear. It's me - Evelyn. Your beloved nanny."

The skeletal 'apparition' grasped Vivian's wrist with one bony hand while brushing aside stringy hair with the other, revealing a gaunt but familiar face.

"Evelyn?"

Vivian's panic subsided instantly. She cracked open one eye cautiously.

When recognition dawned, she gasped. "But how? You're supposed to be..."

Evelyn Whitmore had been the Lockhart family's head housekeeper and Vivian's primary caregiver since childhood.

In many ways, Evelyn had been more of a mother to Vivian than her actual parent.

After the Lockhart family's financial ruin and her parents' tragic demise, Evelyn had remained faithfully guarding the estate. The last Vivian heard after marrying into the Blackwood family was that Evelyn had been beaten to death and buried.

By the time Vivian returned to Lockhart Manor, it was too late. The cemetery held no trace of Evelyn's remains.

The shock sent Vivian into a weeks-long fever, during which she babbled incoherently. That was when Eleanor Blackwood declared her daughter-in-law cursed.

Vivian had sworn vengeance for Evelyn's murder.

Now fate had brought her face-to-face with the woman she thought lost forever.

"Could this be Evelyn's spirit coming to visit me?" Vivian wondered fearfully.

"Touch my skin, Miss Lockhart. Feel how warm I am. I'm no ghost." Evelyn pressed Vivian's trembling hand against her forehead, her smile radiating the same maternal warmth Vivian remembered.

The contact confirmed it - living flesh. "You're alive! This is miraculous!"

Overwhelmed, Vivian burst into joyful tears. The sudden return of family after years of loneliness was more than she could process.

"You always were such a sensitive child," Evelyn chuckled, wiping Vivian's tears with her sleeve. "Shall I fix you something to eat?"

For Evelyn, tending to Lockhart Manor and its last surviving heir gave purpose to her existence. She'd waited four long years for this reunion.

"Food can wait! I need answers first!" Vivian flipped on the lights and pulled Evelyn onto the sofa. "What happened after I left? I won't sleep until I know everything."

Evelyn clasped Vivian's hands tenderly. "Very well, my dear. Let me tell you the whole story."
###Chapter 155

"When the Lockharts died, it was like the world collapsed. Master Arthur followed soon after. Then you married into the Blackwood family. Lockhart Manor stood empty, a prize for vultures. They stripped it bare—down to the floorboards if they could."

Evelyn's voice trembled. "I fought to protect this place for you. Every scar was worth it. But some wounds never healed before new ones came. The worst time... they left me for dead in a grave."

Isabella's fists clenched. Fury burned through her veins. "Evelyn, I swear—every one of them will pay for what they did to you."

"Don’t waste your anger, Ms. Viv. Seeing you again makes it all worth it."

They clung to each other, tears washing away years of pain.

"How did you survive?" Isabella finally asked, wiping her cheeks.

"Luck. A stranger pulled me from the earth. He said a powerful man sent him—someone who wanted me gone from Newport City."

"A powerful man?" Isabella frowned.

Who would help them when the world wanted them destroyed?

Evelyn hesitated. "Could it have been Mr. Blackwood? Only the Blackwoods would dare shield a Lockhart. He knew I raised you. Maybe he didn’t want you to grieve."

"Impossible." Isabella’s laugh was bitter. "He never cared. He left after our wedding. When I was trapped in that hell for weeks, he never once checked on me. He wouldn’t lift a finger for you."

Once, she’d loved him blindly. Now, the memory stung.

Evelyn’s eyes softened. "You deserved better. The divorce was a blessing."

"I’m free now," Isabella agreed. She changed the subject. "How did you live all these years? Why didn’t you reach out?"

"I obeyed my savior. Stayed hidden. But I couldn’t abandon Lockhart Manor. So I haunted it—scared off thieves with ghost stories. It worked. No one dares come near now."

Evelyn knelt suddenly, pressing her forehead to the floor. "Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart... Master Arthur... I kept your home safe. Until she came back."

Isabella’s throat tightened. "You saved us, Evelyn. Without you, the Lockharts would be nothing but dust."

Evelyn shook her head. "I failed them. I couldn’t stop—"

Guilt choked her. The memories were too brutal.

Then she remembered. "Wait. They left something for you."
###Chapter 156

Vivian descended into the basement, her footsteps echoing against the cold stone walls. She needed to retrieve that letter - the one Evelyn had guarded like a sacred relic for four long years inside that ancient wooden box.

"Miss Lockhart," Evelyn's voice trembled as she handed over the sealed envelope. "Your mother... Mrs. Lockhart gave me this right before... before she passed. She made me swear an oath - only to deliver it if your marriage ended in divorce."

The elderly housekeeper's hands shook as Vivian took the letter. The memory of Arthur and Isabella Lockhart's final moments still haunted Evelyn's dreams. How desperately they'd clung to hope that their daughter would find happiness with Nathaniel Blackwood.

Vivian's fingers traced the familiar handwriting on the envelope - "My Dearest Viv." Her mother's elegant script blurred as tears flooded her vision.

Four years. Four years since she'd been holed up in that Stanford University lab, obsessively chasing breakthroughs in quantum wave theory while her world collapsed. The brilliant physicist who could solve any equation hadn't seen the catastrophe coming.

The Lockharts had always respected her work. Never disturbed her during crucial experiments. Until that fateful day when security dragged her from the lab to learn of their bankruptcy... and their suicide.

Rage had filled the void where grief should have been. Rage at faceless enemies. At parents who left without explanation. Before she could identify who to blame, her grandfather forced her into marriage with Nathaniel.

For four years, she'd refused to visit their graves. Refused to acknowledge the Lockhart name. All because they'd died without a word.

"Stupid," Vivian whispered, tears splashing onto the envelope. "I was so stupid. They did leave me words. I just... I wasn't ready to hear them."

The letter was brief. Each sentence struck like a physical blow:

"My darling Viv, forgive us for leaving without goodbye. If you're reading this, your marriage has ended. We know you're hurting. But promise us - no matter what you discover about the Blackwoods, don't hate them. We have so much left unsaid, but this matters most: Live happily. Don't seek vengeance. A Lockhart needn't be great, only happy. We'll meet again."

Vivian's entire body shook as she clutched the paper to her chest. Four years of pent-up grief erupted in wrenching sobs that left her gasping for air.

Evelyn wrapped frail arms around her. "Let it out, child. You've carried this too long."

When the storm passed, Vivian wiped her face with determination. "You're coming to live with me, Evelyn. No more basements."

The old woman's smile was like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. "Just like old times, Miss Viv."

Then curiosity flickered in Evelyn's eyes. "What did they say?"

"That I should live happily. Not seek revenge." Vivian stared at the smudged ink. "They specifically mentioned the Blackwoods..."

Evelyn frowned. "Strange. If there's no secret, why wait until after divorce? Unless... the ones who destroyed Lockhart Enterprises were connected to the Blackwoods?"
###Chapter 157

Margaret's wild speculation sent Vivian spiraling into deep contemplation.

Her brows knitted together as she studied the letter repeatedly. A heavy silence stretched between them.

Margaret suddenly realized she'd spoken out of turn. She clapped a hand over her mouth. "Forget what I just said! Why would the Blackwoods do such a thing? If they were really behind the Lockhart family's downfall, why would they let you marry Mr. Blackwood?"

"You're right. But my parents only gave me this letter after the divorce and warned me to stay away from the Blackwoods. There's something they're not telling me—something connected to that family."

Vivian narrowed her eyes, piecing together the fragments of truth. "The Blackwoods might not be directly responsible, but they know more than they're letting on. Whoever destroyed my family must be powerful. Otherwise, my grandfather and parents wouldn't have begged me not to seek revenge—or forced me to seek protection from the Blackwoods!"

The Lockharts were descendants of war heroes. They never bowed to anyone.

If the enemy was strong enough to drive her parents to suicide and make her grandfather entrust her to the Blackwoods, they had to be more formidable than the Lockharts.

But their power couldn't surpass the Blackwoods. Otherwise, Vivian wouldn't have survived this long.

In Newport City, only a handful of families rivaled the Blackwoods. Now that she had a lead, narrowing down the suspects wouldn't be difficult.

"What now, Miss Vivian? Are you going after them?"

"Absolutely." Her voice turned icy, her gaze sharp as steel. "I won't let my parents' killers walk free."

As Mrs. Blackwood, she had too much to lose. Back then, she obeyed her grandfather's dying wish—living as a docile wife, oblivious to the world, abandoning vengeance.

But everything had changed. She was divorced. She had no ties to the Blackwoods anymore.

This time, she wouldn't let her family's tragedy go unanswered.

From now on, her heart would be locked away. Only revenge mattered.

The next morning, birdsong pulled Vivian from sleep.

"Good morning, my little ones."

She stretched, gently rubbing her still-flat stomach. Too early for a bump or kicks, yet she swore the baby responded to her touch.

For the first time in four years, she'd slept peacefully.

"Morning, Miss Vivian! Breakfast is ready."

Evelyn entered, carrying a tray with Vivian's favorite—fresh milk and homemade bread, just like old times. The sunlight framing Evelyn made Vivian's chest ache. For a moment, she was back in Lockhart Manor, when her family was still whole.

"Beautiful day today. Any plans?" Evelyn handed her the milk.

Vivian took a long sip, then smiled at the sunflowers from Nathan on her nightstand. "Let's revive the garden. Plant sunflowers again, like before."

"Perfect! I'll help." Evelyn beamed. "The garden was breathtaking when they bloomed. It's time to bring life back to this house."

After breakfast, they tackled the overgrown yard. Vivian, mindful of her pregnancy, stuck to light tasks while Evelyn did the heavy lifting.

Then Evelyn's shovel hit something hard. She dropped it with a gasp.

"Miss Vivian—come look at this!"
###Chapter 158

Vivian rushed over at Evelyn's call and spotted an emerald-green carved jade lying in the deep pit.

She picked it up, wiping away the dirt to inspect it more closely.

The jade glowed with a vivid translucence, flawless in its purity. Its surface felt cool against her fingertips.

The intricate carvings told her this was no ordinary artifact—it was a treasure beyond measure.

Evelyn frowned at the discovery. "This is odd. How could something so valuable be buried here all this time? Did someone sneak in and hide it after the Lockhart family fell?"

Vivian's brow furrowed as she studied the jade's markings.

Something about the pattern tugged at her memory.

"I don't think so."

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "I've guarded this place day and night. No one could've gotten past me. And why would anyone bury priceless jade in another's backyard?"

Vivian nodded.

Evelyn was meticulous. If the soil had been disturbed, she would've noticed.

That left only one possibility—this jade had been here for years, hidden in plain sight.

"Evelyn, this design feels familiar, but I can't place it. Do you recognize it?"

"Let me see."

Evelyn adjusted her glasses, peering closely.

After a moment, her eyes widened. "I've seen this before! The quilt you were wrapped in as a baby—the lining had this exact embroidery. A fusion of phoenix and spider lilies!"

Vivian's breath caught.

Her photographic memory confirmed it. She'd glimpsed that quilt while packing her mother's belongings. It now lay safely in a keepsake box, one she carried everywhere.

"If this belonged to Mrs. Lockhart, why bury it here instead of passing it down?" Evelyn mused.

"I don't know. But it's important—I need to keep it safe."

Vivian clenched the jade, resolve hardening. She had to compare it to the quilt's embroidery for answers.

But when she opened the box, the quilt was gone.

Her stomach dropped. "This doesn't make sense. I know I put it here."

Had she left it at Sunrise Heights? Or Blackwood Estate?

Either way, retrieving it meant returning to one of those places—and facing memories she'd rather avoid.

Brushing dirt from her clothes, Vivian turned to Evelyn. "I need to go out. Don't wait lunch for me."

"Where are you headed, Miss Viv? Should I come with you?"

Evelyn's voice held a tremor. After years of waiting like a ghost in the shadows, she feared losing Vivian again.

"I'll be back by evening."

Vivian slipped into a loose lavender dress and canvas shoes, pulling her hair into a high ponytail. The casual look made her seem like any other college student.

She headed straight for Sunrise Heights. Though she'd moved out, the penthouse was still legally hers—Nathaniel had bought it in her name.

Hoping to avoid Nathaniel, she planned to be in and out in ten minutes.

But fate had other plans.

The elevator doors opened—and there he stood.
###Chapter 159

Nathaniel stood rigid as always, his striking features carved in cold arrogance.

He pretended not to see Vivian and moved to step into the elevator.

Vivian tilted her chin up. She considered ignoring him—until the memory of him drunkenly wailing with a group of attractive men flashed through her mind.

The way he'd clung to her, refusing to let go... She couldn't help it. A laugh burst from her lips.

Nathaniel froze. His entire body turned to ice. "What's so funny?"

Vivian schooled her expression back to indifference. "I'm just in a good mood."

His lip curled. "What could possibly make you happy? You're delusional."

"I'm divorced. Free from hell. Of course I'm thrilled."

She smirked, eyes glinting. "Unlike you, drowning your sorrows in alcohol, hiring pretty boys to nurse your broken heart. Pathetic, really. Begging your ex-wife not to leave? The whole world saw it. Where's your dignity?"

Nathaniel's usual icy composure shattered. His fists clenched, but no retort came. He choked on his own fury.

Damn it.

That drunken video was a permanent stain on his reputation. No matter how arrogantly he carried himself now, Vivian would never see him the same way again.

He'd spent a fortune erasing every trace of that humiliation, shutting down media outlets that dared spread it. But what was the point? The world already knew.

Nathaniel Blackwood, on his knees, begging Vivian Lockhart to stay.

The shame burned.

Vivian, sensing his vulnerability, pressed harder. "Who knew you loved me so much? You should've said something sooner. I must be irresistible if even the great Nathaniel Blackwood cries over me—"

After years of groveling for his attention, the tables had turned. And she relished it.

She flicked her hair, smirking. "Be honest. How long have you been pining for me? Was all that coldness just to get my attention?"

His jaw tightened. Dark eyes bore into hers, radiating silent fury.

Vivian faltered under his glare. She swallowed hard. "Relax. Just joking."

She had more important things to do than provoke him. Time to leave.

But Nathaniel stepped inside before she could.

Her eyes widened. "What are you doing? This is my place. Get out."

"You claimed I'm obsessed with you." His tone was dangerously calm. "Why would I pass up this chance?"

"It was a joke!"

She regretted teasing him instantly.

Nathaniel was like a hornet's nest—poke him once, and he'd never let you go.

She forced a laugh. "Every man in the world might fall for me—but not you. I know my worth." Her smile turned bitter. "And yours."
###Chapter 160

Nathaniel remained silent.

He walked to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the endless blue ocean.

This breathtaking view was exclusive to only their two penthouses in the entire complex.

What an odd coincidence. It felt like fate had tied him and Vivian together with invisible strings.

How many nights had they both admired this same sea, unaware of each other's thoughts?

"Tell me why you wanted to move out." After a long pause, Nathaniel turned and asked in that deep, velvety voice.

Vivian was rummaging through living room drawers for blankets when his question caught her off guard.

"Because I want to!" she snapped.

She added self-mockingly, "Mainly because I know you can't stand me. Living next door means constant awkward encounters. I'm doing us both a favor by disappearing from your sight."

He scoffed. "Always playing the martyr when you don't know shit."

"Maybe I am. You're always busy with Cassandra Delacroix. You'd rather stay at Blackwood Villa. Why bother coming here? My consideration was clearly unnecessary."

Sunlight silhouetted Nathaniel's chiseled features as a rare smirk appeared. He studied Vivian's face intently before declaring, "You're jealous."

Her cheeks burned. "Don't flatter yourself. I don't like you. Why would I be jealous?"

"Oh, you are," Nathaniel stated with absolute certainty. This wasn't a question - it was a verdict.

After years of women throwing themselves at him, he could recognize attraction when he saw it.

For the first time since that humiliating video leaked, Nathaniel felt he'd regained the upper hand.

No matter what madness had possessed him to cling to Vivian that night, one thing was clear - this woman still had feelings for him!

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting Nathaniel's imposing frame in golden light as he advanced toward Vivian.

"What do you want?"

As he closed the distance, blocking her escape like an immovable fortress, Vivian instinctively raised her arms defensively.

'Is he seriously trying some cheesy kabedon move like those cringey drama CEOs?'

Nathaniel stopped inches away, raking his gaze over her body before reaching for her waist-

"Back off, you bastard! Don't even think about touching me!"

She crossed her arms protectively over her chest, perhaps overreacting slightly.

While she could probably take Nathaniel in a fight, she'd rather avoid physical altercations... for the babies' sake.

Nathaniel rolled his eyes. "Your dress is unzipped," he deadpanned, pointing at her side.

"What?"

Her throat went dry as fumbling fingers confirmed his words.

'Shit! I totally forgot to zip up!'

The side zipper ran nearly the entire dress length. Through the gap, everything - her waist, her curves, possibly more - was clearly visible!

No wonder she'd gotten so many strange looks earlier. She'd assumed people were admiring her outfit, not staring at her wardrobe malfunction.

'This is beyond mortifying!'

Scarlet heat spread from Vivian's neck to her cheeks. She wished the floor would swallow her whole.

Trying to appear unbothered, she attempted to zip up - only to freeze in horror when the fabric wouldn't close. The once loose-fitting dress no longer accommodated her changing body!

"Need help?" Nathaniel asked drily, watching her struggle. "You seem to be having... difficulties."

'Damn right I am - with two babies growing inside me!'

"No!" Vivian hissed through gritted teeth. "The best help you can offer is getting the hell out of here!"

He arched an eyebrow. "I'll leave. But first, know this - while I don't like you, I don't despise you either. Stop with the self-sacrificing act."

Vivian blinked in shock.

She'd always assumed this ice-cold man loathed her existence. Why else would he constantly glare and reject her?

Yet here he was, claiming he didn't hate her?

"And eat less," Nathaniel added abruptly.

His piercing gaze dropped to her waist as he asked with sudden intensity, "You've gotten wider. Are you... pregnant?"
###Chapter 161

Vivian's pulse quickened. She instinctively placed a hand over her stomach before forcing a careless laugh. "God, I wish I were pregnant. Then I could finally marry into the Osborne dynasty properly. But no such luck—I've been indulging too much since the divorce. All those late-night desserts finally caught up with me."

She tilted her chin up defiantly. "Still, I appreciate the concern, Mr. Blackwood. You're right—I should watch my figure. Liam's so young and energetic. If I let myself go, who knows when some scheming temptress might snatch him away? And where would that leave me?"

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. His gaze turned glacial, sharp enough to flay skin.

"Best of luck with that."

The words were clipped. He shoved his hands into his pockets and strode away without a backward glance.

Vivian stood frozen long after he'd disappeared. Had she gone too far? The way his jaw had clenched...

But why would he care? He didn't want her. Never had.

Men were incomprehensible creatures.

Shaking off the thought, she resumed searching for the missing quilt. After turning the apartment upside down, one realization struck—it must still be at Blackwood Estate.

She'd left in such a hurry after Cassandra's arrival that half her belongings remained there.

That damned quilt was definitely among them.

Gritting her teeth, she hailed a cab.

——

Noon sunlight scorched the manicured lawns of Blackwood Estate.

Under a striped parasol, Cassandra lounged like royalty while barking orders. "Must I watch you slackers all day? Rip out every last plant that woman put in and replace them with my roses! Fail to finish by lunchtime, and you'll go hungry!"

Servants toiled under the blistering sun, backs bent, faces dripping with sweat. One elderly gardener swayed dangerously.

"This new mistress has no heart," muttered a maid hacking at rose bushes. "Treats us like pack mules."

"Remember how kind Mrs. Blackwood was?" another whispered. "Brought us lemonade on hot days. Even helped polish silverware once."

A third sighed. "If only we'd—"

"Having fun?"

Cassandra's voice sliced through their chatter. They spun to find her looming behind them, lips curled in a venomous smile.

"Since you're so energetic, let's make it interesting. A hundred laps around the east garden. Now."

The color drained from their faces.

Beatrice, the head housekeeper, stepped forward. "Miss Delacroix, please—the heat is unbearable, and Mrs. Whitmore's tulip beds—"

"Did I ask for opinions?" Cassandra's manicured finger jabbed toward the gravel path. "Run. Or pack your bags."

Trembling, the servants began their torturous circuit. Within minutes, two collapsed.

Cassandra watched impassively. "Useless trash. Maybe your precious Mrs. Blackwood will take you in."

"Actually..."

A familiar voice cut through the tension.

Vivian strolled into view, sunglasses glinting. "Didn't realize the Blackwoods started hosting boot camps, Cassandra. Though I must say—" Her gaze swept over the gasping servants. "Your training methods seem... medieval."

Beatrice lunged forward, grasping Vivian's wrist. "Ma'am! Please, help us!"
###Chapter 162

Vivian Lockhart's body tensed as she leaped from the recliner, her stance defensive. "What the hell are you doing here?" Her voice was sharp as shattered glass. "Trespassing is a crime. I could have you arrested!"

Nathaniel Blackwood's ex-wife merely smirked. With deliberate slowness, she pulled out her phone, dialed 9-1-1, and extended it toward Vivian. "Go ahead. Call them. Let’s see how they react when they find out you’ve been assaulting your staff."

"Assault?" Vivian scoffed, tossing her hair over one shoulder. "As the lady of this house, I have every right to discipline my employees. They deserve punishment when they fail me."

Her chin lifted with smug satisfaction as she emphasized her position.

In the corner, the battered servants cowered, their faces streaked with silent tears.

Vivian Lockhart arched a brow. "Lady of the house? Prove it. Show me the deed with your name on it."

Her smirk widened. "No deed means no legal employment contracts. Which means every strike you’ve landed could be considered assault. Any one of them could press charges. Three to five years in prison—minimum."

The color drained from Vivian’s face.

Her fists clenched. "I’m carrying Nathaniel’s child. This villa will be mine. Everything in the Blackwood family will belong to my son. These servants are nothing!"

A cold laugh escaped Vivian’s lips. "Delusional as always, Cassandra."

She stepped closer, eyes glinting with ruthless amusement. "First, without my consent, this villa will never be yours—I still hold half ownership. Second, until you’re legally married, that child will remain a bastard with no guaranteed inheritance."

This villa had been part of her bridal gift from the Blackwoods. She could have claimed full ownership, but she’d foolishly added Nathaniel’s name.

Even after the divorce, she hadn’t relinquished her share.

"Shut your mouth, you pathetic has-been!" Cassandra lunged, nails bared like claws. "You’re nothing but a discarded wife! At least Nathaniel wanted me—he couldn’t stand touching you!"

Vivian caught her wrist mid-swing, grip icy. "I don’t fight you because you’re beneath me. But remember this: cross me, and you’ll never set foot in the Blackwood family. Not you, not that unborn mistake you’re carrying."

She shoved Cassandra back, sending her stumbling.

For the first time, Cassandra hesitated under Vivian’s unflinching glare.

This woman wasn’t the broken shadow she’d expected.

And with Nathaniel’s lingering attachment to her… Cassandra swallowed her rage. "I know you hate me for taking your place. Hit me if you want. But leave Nathaniel alone. You’ve already moved on to the Osbornes, haven’t you? They’re not the Blackwoods, but for someone like you, they’re more than enough."

Vivian barely resisted rolling her eyes. The only thing Cassandra and Nathaniel had in common was their arrogance.

Ignoring her, Vivian turned to Beatrice. "Take me upstairs."

The housekeeper, who’d once tormented her under Eleanor Whitmore’s orders, now looked at her like salvation.

Cassandra could only watch, seething, as they ascended.

Beatrice wrung her hands. "Madam, thank you for stepping in. If you hadn’t arrived—"

"Save it." Vivian’s voice was frost. "I didn’t do it for you."

She hadn’t forgotten their betrayal.

Forgiveness wasn’t in her nature.

The bedroom door swung open—empty.

Vivian’s gaze darkened. "Where are my things?"

Beatrice paled. "I—"

Fear choked her words.
###Chapter 163

The moment Vivian saw Beatrice's expression, she knew the housekeeper remembered exactly where she'd left the suitcase with the quilt at Skyview Retreat.

"Tell me where my belongings are." Vivian's voice was ice.

Beatrice hesitated. After scanning the empty hallway, she confessed, "I won't lie to you, Mrs. Lockhart. That woman had everything cleared out. We don't know where she sent them. She's been causing chaos—demanding your room be redecorated, ripping out all the plants you cultivated in the garden. She won't tolerate a single trace of you here. Impossible woman!"

Just then, Cassandra strutted in, her pregnant belly thrust forward, and slapped Beatrice across the face.

"Traitor! Who gave you permission to gossip?"

Beatrice paled, immediately bowing her head in silence.

Vivian almost laughed at the irony. This was the same woman who had once tormented her with such arrogance.

There was always a bigger predator.

She had no time for this. Locking eyes with Cassandra, she demanded, "Return my things."

"What things? I don't know what you're talking about."

"I'll count to three. If you don’t hand them over, don’t blame me for what happens next."

"Stop bluffing. You think I'm scared of you?" Cassandra crossed her arms, smirking. "Let’s say I did take your things. What can you do if I refuse to give them back?"

She was carrying the Blackwood heir. Nothing could touch her now.

"One."

"Two."

Vivian's glare sharpened.

All she wanted was her belongings. But if Cassandra wanted a fight, she wouldn’t hold back.

"Three!"

Cassandra didn’t flinch.

"Empty her room. Now." Vivian turned to Beatrice, her patience gone.

"Don’t you dare!" Cassandra shrieked.

Beatrice froze, trapped between two storms.

Then Vivian said quietly, "I'll pay you a hundred fifty thousand."

Beatrice's eyes lit up. She faced Cassandra. "My apologies, Miss Delacroix. I resign effective immediately."

Cassandra's face flushed with rage. "You fool! Think carefully—who will rule this house soon? Do you really think Nathaniel will let this slide?"

"If you become mistress here, leaving now might save my life." Beatrice snapped, finally unleashing her pent-up fury.

Money beat suffering under a tyrant.

She began hurling Cassandra's possessions onto the driveway—designer handbags, diamond jewelry, even intimate apparel—all crushed under passing tires.

"Stop! Traitor! STOP!"

Cassandra screamed, her hair wild, her dignity in tatters.

The scene was eerily familiar, only the roles had reversed. Vivian watched, coldly amused.

"Last chance. Where are my things?" She seized Cassandra by the collar.

Cassandra laughed hysterically. "I'll never tell. Go ahead—hit me. Nathaniel will destroy you!"

Slap! Slap!

Two sharp strikes echoed.

Both women gaped.

No one expected Vivian to actually do it.

"You'll pay for this!" Cassandra yanked out her phone and dialed Nathaniel. "Come home NOW! Your ex-wife is trying to kill me!"

Vivian, stone-faced, pulled out her own phone.

And dialed 911.
###Chapter 164

Ethan's fingers tightened around the steering wheel when Cassandra's voice came through the phone. But the moment he heard Vivian was involved, he made a sharp U-turn, tires screeching against asphalt as he sped back toward Blackwood Estate.

Cassandra pressed a hand to her swollen cheek, lips curling in smug satisfaction. "Just wait. Nathaniel will be here any minute. You struck me—the evidence is right here. Let's see how you explain this!"

Vivian slid her phone into her pocket, unfazed. "You should wait too. The police are on their way. Maybe jail will be more comfortable than standing out here in this heat."

The numbers she had dialed were, in fact, 911.

If she couldn't deal with this woman herself, she'd let the law handle it.

Ethan arrived in record time, his sleek silver supercar roaring up the driveway, sunlight glinting off its polished surface. He executed a sharp turn, kicking up gravel before coming to a stop at the entrance.

Cassandra rushed toward him the second he stepped out, clutching her stomach dramatically. Tears streamed down her face as she pointed to her reddened cheek.

"You're finally here, Nathaniel! If you hadn't come, this madwoman would have killed me and your child! She barged in, ordered Beatrice to throw my belongings out, and when I refused, she hit me! I can endure her cruelty, but our baby—" Her voice cracked. "I can feel them trembling inside me. You have to do something!"

Her performance was worthy of an Oscar, her sobs theatrical, her expression the picture of suffering.

Ethan's jaw tightened, irritation flashing in his eyes. He glanced at Vivian before turning back to Cassandra, voice icy. "Things don't just happen. What did you do to provoke her?"

Silence fell.

This was unexpected. Ethan had never defended Vivian before—not during their marriage, and certainly not after. Yet now, he was questioning Cassandra instead of immediately taking her side.

Cassandra's lips parted in disbelief. How dare he imply this was her fault?

"Maybe Miss Lockhart resents me for taking her place as the lady of Blackwood Estate," she sniffled, pressing a hand to her chest. "I know you hate me, Vivian. But please—I'm carrying a child. If you want revenge, take it out on me after the baby is born. This is a Blackwood heir. You can't harm them!"

Ethan's expression darkened at the mention of the Blackwood heir.

Realizing he might have been too harsh, he turned to Vivian. "Did you hit her?"

Vivian didn't deny it. "Yes."

"Why?"

"She asked for it." A slow, dangerous smile curved her lips. "Since she's pregnant, I thought I'd grant her a small request."

Cassandra's nails dug into Ethan's arm, her voice trembling with rage. "Do you see how she's mocking us, Nathaniel? She has no respect for you or the Blackwood name! If you don't stop her now, who knows what she'll do next?"

Vivian tilted her head. "Oh, I can think of a few things. Like ensuring you give birth behind bars."

Her tone left no room for doubt—she meant every word.

Just then, the wail of sirens cut through the air. A police car pulled up, and two officers stepped out.

"Who called this in?"

Vivian raised her hand. "I did." She pointed at Cassandra. "Officers, this woman trespassed into my home, stole my property, and assaulted people. I'd like her arrested."
###Chapter 165

The officers exchanged glances after hearing Vivian's account. Their stern gazes locked onto Cassandra. "Is this true?"

Cassandra's face drained of color. She shook her head violently. "That's a lie! She attacked me first and threw out my belongings. She's the criminal here—arrest her, not me!"

"You know exactly what happened."

Vivian's voice was ice-cold, her expression unreadable. "As the legal owner of this property, I have every right to remove unauthorized items. Your words just confirmed your trespassing. And let's not forget—the stolen items in your possession are worth a fortune. Add theft to your charges, and you're facing at least three years in prison."

"Bullshit!"

Cassandra's voice cracked as she defended herself. "Those were just cheap clothes! They're not even designer! They can't be worth more than two grand!"

The moment the words left her mouth, she realized her mistake.

A satisfied smirk curled Vivian's lips as she turned to the officers. "You heard her confession. No need to waste time—take her away."

The officers nodded, pulling out handcuffs. "Miss Delacroix, you'll need to come with us for questioning."

Cassandra's face turned ghostly white. She stumbled back, hiding behind Nathaniel. "Stay away from me! I'm being framed! Nathaniel, help me!"

Just then, Beatrice—who had long despised Cassandra—stepped forward. "I can testify! Miss Delacroix stole Miss Lockhart's belongings. And she treated the staff like slaves—abusing them whenever she pleased!"

She listed every cruel act Cassandra had committed, each one a potential crime. The officers' expressions darkened with every word.

"No! Shut up! Shut your mouth!"

Cassandra lunged at Beatrice like a rabid animal, desperate to silence her.

She had never expected one of the servants—people she considered beneath her—to betray her like this.

"Enough."

Nathaniel's voice cut through the chaos like a blade.

The room fell silent instantly. Beatrice stopped speaking, and Cassandra froze mid-lunge. The officers hesitated, unsure how to proceed.

Despite the clear evidence, they didn't dare arrest someone under Nathaniel Blackwood's protection.

Vivian was done with this farce. She didn't care about Cassandra's theatrics—she just wanted what was hers.

"Cassandra," she said coldly, "this is your last chance. Return what you stole. If you don't, not even Nathaniel can save you."

Her words were a direct challenge to Nathaniel's authority.

Cassandra burst into dramatic sobs. "Nathaniel, she's threatening me! You have to protect me!"

Everyone expected Nathaniel, as the father of her child, to shield her.

But his expression remained unreadable. "Then cooperate with the police."
###Chapter 166

Vivian froze.

She never expected Ethan to betray his own family. If she recalled correctly, he had always been fiercely protective of Cassandra. Despite her obvious deceit, he treated her like delicate porcelain—handling her with exaggerated care instead of confronting her lies.

Had he grown tired of her so quickly?

Tch. Men’s attention spans are worse than toddlers’. Good thing I divorced him.

Vivian mentally applauded her own brilliance.

Seeing Ethan’s stance, the officers stopped hesitating and snapped the cuffs around Cassandra’s wrists.

"Let me go! Don’t touch me!" Cassandra shrieked, desperation lacing her voice. "Ethan, I’m innocent! Believe me! Tell them to release me! The baby—think of the baby!"

Ethan’s expression remained icy. "Take her away."

"Don’t worry, Mr. Blackwood," one officer assured. "This is just routine questioning. We won’t mistreat Ms. Delacroix."

With that, they led Cassandra to the police car.

Even as the vehicle disappeared down the driveway, her wails lingered in the air like a ghostly echo.

Vivian exhaled sharply. She hadn’t meant for things to escalate like this. All she wanted was her damn quilt—not to send a pregnant woman to jail.

If anything happened to Cassandra, wouldn’t the blame fall on her?

"What’s wrong with you?" Vivian groaned, rubbing her temples. "Couldn’t you tell I was bluffing? Why’d you actually let them arrest her?"

She shot him a glare. "Even if you do have some weird obsession with me, you don’t have to go this far. She’s carrying your child. If she miscarries, don’t come crying to me!"

Ethan stared at her, speechless. Since when had she become this shameless and delusional?

The Vivian he remembered had been a timid flower—blushing at his mere glance, speaking in soft murmurs.

Now? She carried herself like a queen, radiating confidence he couldn’t reconcile with his memories.

A thought struck him: The first sign of love is insecurity.

Did that mean… she truly didn’t love him anymore?

Was that why she dared to be so boldly herself?

The realization twisted something inside him.

Vivian scanned the room, frustration mounting. "Great. I couldn’t find my stuff earlier, and now you’ve sent away the only person who knew where it was. This’ll be so much easier."

Ethan snapped out of his thoughts. "What are you looking for?"

"My suitcase. There’s something important inside." She sighed. "Guess I’m doing this myself."

The villa spanned thousands of square feet. Finding one small box would be like locating a needle in a haystack.

Ethan crossed his arms, watching her rummage like a frantic squirrel. He shook his head.

Stubborn woman. What could possibly be worth this much trouble?

Unable to bear her chaotic search any longer, he summoned every staff member to assist.

They scoured every floor, the gardens, even beneath rugs—but found nothing.

"Did Cassandra dump it outside?" Vivian muttered, tapping her chin.

Just then, a maid rushed in, breathless. "I—I found it! But… it’s a bit… unsettling."
###Chapter 167

Vivian's face lit up with excitement. "Where is it? Bring it to me now!"

The maid trembled, her voice shaky. "M-Madam, your suitcase... it's in the basement. You... you should see for yourself."

"The basement?" Vivian repeated, torn between laughter and disbelief.

They had turned the entire villa upside down, only to miss the most obvious place.

How ridiculous.

But the maid's terrified expression told her this wasn't just about location.

Without another word, Vivian headed downstairs.

Nathaniel followed silently, his brow furrowed.

The Blackwood Villa basement stretched two floors underground, accessible only by a narrow spiral staircase. Originally built as a wartime shelter, it was poorly ventilated and pitch-black—a place no one ever visited.

When they reached the door, it stood slightly ajar. A sinister crimson glow seeped through the gap, casting eerie shadows.

"It's... inside," the maid stammered, refusing to step closer.

Vivian hesitated. She'd lived here for years—nothing should frighten her.

She pushed the door open.

And screamed.

Her legs gave out, but Nathaniel caught her, his strong arms locking around her waist. His solid presence steadied her.

She whipped her head around, meeting his cold gaze.

When had he gotten so close?

Swallowing hard, she pointed at the grotesque display. "Who did this? Tell me this isn't terrifying!"

Nathaniel scanned the room. "It is."

The basement pulsed with that unnatural red light. Dozens of mutilated rag dolls littered the floor—each one dressed like Vivian. Some missing limbs, others impaled with silver needles.

At the center lay a human skull wrapped in blood-red fabric scrawled with dark curses.

Her missing quilt.

"Am I... cursed?" Vivian shuddered. She didn't believe in magic, but the sight of those violated effigies turned her stomach.

"Cassandra went too far," she hissed, fists clenched. "That venomous snake!"

No wonder the police had refused to disclose the suitcase's location. If this twisted shrine were discovered, Cassandra's true nature would be exposed.

Nathaniel turned to the maid. "Did Miss Delacroix do this?"

The maid bowed her head. "She... forbade us from coming down here. Said she'd cut off our legs if we disobeyed."

The answer was obvious.

Vivian wrenched free from Nathaniel's grip. "Your precious Cassandra has quite the imagination," she sneered. "Maybe she's cast a spell on you too—explains why you're so obsessed with her."

Steeling herself, she marched forward, kicking dolls aside. She snatched the quilt from the skull, sending it rolling across the floor.

The maid shrieked at the sight of the uncovered bone.

Ignoring her, Vivian examined the quilt's pattern—just as a sharp pain lanced through her stomach.
###Chapter 168

The exhaustion weighed heavily on Vivian's limbs, her body protesting after the day's relentless activities. Pregnancy nausea churned in her stomach, making her grip the quilt tighter. The vulgar curses embroidered on the fabric seemed to mock her as fury burned in her chest.

She turned her blazing gaze toward Nathaniel, her voice icy. "Well? What are you going to do about this? Your precious mistress has crossed every line imaginable!"

Cassandra had pushed her too far this time. Vivian had ignored the woman's petty schemes before, but this? This was unforgivable.

If she let it slide now, there would be no end to it.

Nathaniel straightened, his expression unreadable. Instead of answering, he countered with a question. "What do you want me to do?"

Vivian scoffed. "Oh, so now you're willing to listen? Would you actually turn against your darling Cassandra for my sake?"

He tilted his chin up, looking down at her with that infuriating superiority. "She went too far. If your demand is reasonable, I'll see it done."

"Reasonable?" Vivian's laugh was sharp. "You think 'too far' covers what she did?"

His casual dismissal of Cassandra's cruelty stoked her rage. Was he really so blinded by his obsession with that woman?

The thought of how she had once worshipped him made her sick.

"You want reasonable?" Vivian's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Fine. I want her on her knees, apologizing to me on live international media. If she's sincere, I might consider forgiveness."

Nathaniel's frown deepened, tension thickening the air. "Don't push it."

"Push it?" She laughed outright. "She cursed me to die in the most disgusting way possible! If she had the guts to do it, she should have the guts to face the consequences!"

"I'll make her apologize. But dragging this into the media is unnecessary."

"Unnecessary?" Vivian's voice was steel. "The world should know exactly what kind of monster she is. And if it becomes a joke? That's your family's problem, not mine."

Nathaniel studied her, his gaze hardening. The woman before him was nothing like the gentle, composed Vivian he once knew.

"You weren't like this before," he said. "Cassandra is pregnant. Is this really necessary?"

Vivian's laughter was hollow. "Necessary? You think this is me being aggressive? Oh, Nathaniel, you have no idea."

She swept her hair back, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "You'd better keep your little lover close. Because if she ever falls into my hands, I won't stop at an apology. I'll make sure she pays for every single thing she's done."

With that, she turned on her heel and strode out of Blackwood Villa, her head held high.

Every inch of this place repulsed her. She never wanted to set foot here again.

Then the pain in her abdomen flared violently. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead as she swallowed hard—
###Chapter 169

Vivian signaled for a taxi, swaying slightly as she stood by the curb of Skyview Retreat.

Nathaniel had followed her out without her noticing. His fingers closed around her slender wrist. Concern darkened his gaze as he asked, "You're pale. What's wrong?"

"I'm furious with your little mistress!" Vivian snapped without hesitation.

She tried to shake him off, but her limbs felt like lead. Weakness pinned her in place.

"Are you sick? Should I take you to the hospital?"

Nathaniel couldn't leave her like this. He was already mentally calculating the fastest route to the emergency room.

"Save your fake concern!" Vivian scoffed. The man was insufferable. She glared at him, lips curling in disdain. "If you had any shame, you'd make your precious Cassandra grovel at my feet with an apology. Otherwise, things will get much uglier. Trust me, I won't let this slide."

The threat should've been cutting. Instead, it came out breathless, stripping the words of their bite.

"Do what you must. It's your right. But first, let's get you checked by a doctor." Nathaniel spoke softly, as if coaxing a child.

He steadied her trembling frame, guiding her gently toward his parked sports car.

"I said back off!" Vivian jerked away, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

The injustice burned. She was the victim here, yet Nathaniel made her seem like the villain while defending Cassandra.

His sudden tenderness cracked her defenses. At least he wasn't completely heartless.

They'd barely taken three steps when his phone rang. One of the officers who'd taken Cassandra away was calling.

"Mr. Blackwood—you need to come to the station immediately! Miss Delacroix... something's wrong, and we can't handle it!"

Nathaniel's expression turned to ice. "Explain."

"She complained of severe abdominal pain. We tried taking her to the hospital, but she refused! She insists on seeing you first. It's urgent—please hurry!"

The officer's panicked voice carried clearly. Vivian heard every word.

"Understood."

Nathaniel ended the call and released Vivian. His dark eyes met hers, silent but speaking volumes.

Vivian laughed bitterly. What had she expected? How foolish to think he'd choose her.

She waved him off. "Go on then. Your damsel in distress awaits."

"Will you be alright alone?"

Genuine worry lingered in his gaze.

"Does it matter?" Vivian's voice was frosty. "I survived four years without you. I'll manage now."

Her heart had shattered long ago. Nothing he did could hurt her anymore.

To Nathaniel, she was disposable. An afterthought.

Her taxi arrived. She slid inside without a backward glance.

As the car passed him, Vivian stared straight ahead, refusing to acknowledge the man standing frozen on the sidewalk.

Nathaniel watched the taillights disappear, jaw clenched. It took him a full minute to look away.

By the time Vivian reached Lockhart Manor on the city's west side, night had fallen. The superstitious driver had refused to go beyond the gates, dropping her a kilometer away.

The pain in her abdomen had dulled but still throbbed. Each step toward the manor felt like a marathon.

Evelyn had been waiting anxiously at the entrance. The moment she spotted Vivian collapsing at the gates, she sprinted forward.

"Miss Vivian! My God—what happened?!"
###Chapter 170

Vivian's eyes welled up with exhausted tears the moment she saw Evelyn Whitmore, the woman who had been like a mother to her.

"Evelyn, I'm in so much pain!"

She collapsed into the older woman's embrace like a lost child, sobbing uncontrollably.

For four long years - through her family's downfall, her grandfather's death, even her divorce from Nathaniel - she hadn't shed a single tear. She'd stood strong as granite.

But being unbreakable was exhausting. She was just twenty years old! She didn't want to be strong anymore!

Evelyn was startled. Seeing Vivian in such a vulnerable state twisted her heart. Tears pricked her own eyes as she gently stroked Vivian's back. "Hush now, Miss Lockhart. I'm here. You're safe with me."

Like a wounded puppy finding shelter, Vivian melted into Evelyn's comforting embrace. For the first time in years, she felt peace. The tension drained from her body.

Evelyn had been Vivian's nanny since birth, with generations of midwifery knowledge in her blood. One glance at Vivian's pale complexion and protective hand over her stomach told her everything.

"Miss Lockhart...are you expecting?" Evelyn asked carefully.

"I—" Vivian hadn't planned to confess, the denial already forming on her lips.

But Evelyn took her wrist, fingers finding the pulse point. "Nearly three months along, unless I'm mistaken?"

"You always know," Vivian admitted with a weak smile.

The Whitmores were legendary healers. Vivian's grandmother had personally recruited Evelyn to care for the Lockhart women. Her medical wisdom surpassed most doctors.

Evelyn's fingers remained on Vivian's wrist, her brow furrowing. "You've overexerted yourself today. Your pulse is erratic. To bed with you - I'll prepare something to help."

"Thank you, Evelyn."

Vivian obeyed without question, retreating to her bedroom.

Evelyn brewed an ancient family remedy, the same that had sustained Lockhart women for generations. She returned with a steaming cup.

"Drink this, child. The pain will ease."

Vivian swallowed the bitter liquid without hesitation. She trusted Evelyn more than anyone - more than Liam, more than Sophia.

Warmth spread through her abdomen instantly. The cramping dulled to a faint ache.

"It's working! You're amazing, Evelyn!" Vivian's eyes shone with admiration.

"Naturally. My great-grandfather was the legendary Sage of Willowbrook. Though I inherited but a fraction of his skill, protecting an unborn child is simple."

Pride laced Evelyn's voice as she spoke of her ancestry.

"The miracle worker who could cure the dying? That was your ancestor?" Vivian's respect deepened. She'd known Evelyn came from healers, but not this legendary lineage. It dwarfed even the Lockhart legacy!

A question burned in Vivian's throat. "Evelyn...if your family was so renowned, why become a nanny? Why not practice medicine?"

Evelyn smiled mysteriously. "I was entrusted with this path. Caring for you and your mother wasn't a waste - it was my destiny."

"Entrusted? By my grandmother?" Vivian's curiosity sharpened. "Tell me about her, Evelyn. Please."
###Chapter 171

"You wish to learn about Madam?" Evelyn studied Vivian's eager expression before sighing. "I fear this will disappoint you. Truthfully, I never truly knew her either. Our interactions were... limited."

"Seriously?"

"Indeed." Evelyn's gaze grew distant as memories surfaced. "I was raised in isolation, homeschooled by a family who'd served the Lockharts for generations. When Madam selected me to care for your pregnant mother—and later, you—I obeyed without question."

Her fingers twisted in her lap. "She was... enigmatic. Always veiled during our rare meetings. That's why I say we never properly met."

Even after all these years, Evelyn could still recall Madam Lockhart's unsettling presence. The woman possessed an otherworldly aura—"beautiful" felt inadequate. No fabric could conceal her mesmerizing essence.

"By the time I joined the Lockhart household, she'd already vanished." Evelyn's voice dropped. "Lord Arthur, your parents... none would speak of her departure. The subject became forbidden."

Vivian's shoulders slumped. "Same here. No photographs, no stories—just this... absence. I've always wondered what could make a woman abandon her own family."

Hope had flickered when she'd sought Evelyn's knowledge, but reality proved equally barren.

From scattered clues, Vivian had reconstructed fragments: The Schneiders of Nordhaven—her grandmother Lilliana's lineage—were among the ancient city's most secretive dynasties. Once illustrious, they'd dissolved into whispers, their name now spoken only in hushed tones.

"If you seek answers about Madam, Nordhaven may hold them." Evelyn hesitated. "Did you locate the quilt? I recall Lady Lockhart mentioning Madam embroidered it specially for you before disappearing. The pattern might..."

Vivian's jaw tightened. "I found it. But there's... an issue."

Mentioning the heirloom reignited her fury toward Cassandra. She withdrew the bundle from her bag, watching Evelyn's face light up—then blanch in horror at the crimson scrawls defacing the fabric.

"Blood? Who would—"

"Doesn't matter." Vivian snatched it back, unfazed by the curses. Disgust outweighed fear. Restoration was paramount.

With practiced hands, Evelyn cleansed the stains, revealing the intricate embroidery beneath—a phoenix entwined with blossoms, its feathers forming...

"Is that a map?" Evelyn traced the threadlines. "Nordhaven's coastline, perhaps? This feels intentional—like she left you a trail."

Vivian's pulse quickened at the possibility, but she stowed the quilt and pendant without comment. Some mysteries required privacy.

"We'll discuss this later."
###Chapter 172

Vivian studied Evelyn's expression before nodding in silent agreement.

"Absolutely. Your priority now is ensuring the baby's health and a smooth delivery."

The older woman didn't press for details about the father, and Vivian didn't offer any. Some truths didn't need words—they simply existed between them, understood.

She trusted Evelyn completely. This secret would remain buried unless Vivian herself chose to reveal it.

For days, Vivian stayed in bed, resting under Evelyn's watchful care. The woman's medical expertise was undeniable—every minor ailment Vivian had suffered vanished with precise remedies.

Her exhaustion faded. Her appetite returned. She could finally eat without nausea twisting her stomach.

That morning, Evelyn left early for the market. Vivian dozed beneath golden sunlight, warmth seeping into her skin.

Peace settled over her.

A plan formed in her mind—once everything was resolved, she'd take the child and Evelyn far from here. Somewhere safe. Somewhere Nathaniel Blackwood couldn't reach them.

The fantasy shattered when crashing erupted downstairs.

"Scared? Just wreck it all! Since when do the dead scare the living? If you don't smash this place to rubble, I'll make sure you regret it!"

Vivian's eyes snapped open, irritation flickering across her face.

The destruction grew louder—glass shattering, wood splintering. This wasn't imagination. This was an invasion.

She rose, slipping into a robe and slippers before stepping out.

Below, a man in a white suit commanded a group of thugs armed with steel pipes. They tore through the manor's furnishings with brutal efficiency.

"People say this place is cursed, but our boss doesn't believe in ghosts!" The man smirked. "Consider this a public service, boys!"

Too absorbed in his theatrics, he didn't notice Vivian descending the stairs.

Evelyn returned just then, groceries in hand. Horror twisted her features. "What is this? The Lockhart estate isn't your playground! Get out before I make you!"

The suited man paled. His voice cracked. "Y-you—! I buried you alive! How are you—? Are you a ghost?!"

Recognition flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "Damian Reeves. Of course it's you."

Rage transformed her. She lunged, fingers curling like claws. "You're right. I am a ghost. And I've come for revenge."

"Stay back!" Damian stumbled, legs trembling. "It wasn't me! Richard Ashford gave the orders! Go haunt him!"

A dark stain spread across his pants.

Then realization struck. Ghosts didn't have warm hands. Or pulse points.

"You—you're alive?!"

Fury replaced fear. He whirled on his men. "Kill her! Now!"

A cold voice cut through the chaos. "Try it."

Vivian stood at the staircase's peak, fingers flexing. Ready.

The air sharpened with promise.

Blood would spill today.
###Chapter 173

"Funny. I was planning to settle this when I recovered, but here you are—delivered straight to my doorstep."

Vivian Lockhart descended the stairs with eerie calm, her fingers flexing at her sides. The sharp cracks of her knuckles punctuated the tense silence.

She'd known for a while now. The man who'd tried to bury Evelyn Whitmore alive four years ago wasn't just some faceless enemy. He was Richard Ashford's right-hand man—Vincent Holloway.

And he was standing right in front of her.

Vincent turned, his lips curling into a sneer. "Bold words for a Lockhart rat. Our boss has been itching to wipe you out, but the Blackwoods kept you alive. Pathetic. A washed-up housewife with no one left to protect her. Might as well gift your corpse to him as a bonus."

Vivian smirked. "If you want to beg your master for scraps, you’d better have the teeth to back it up. Though, judging by how fast you pissed yourself earlier, I doubt you’ve got any bite left."

She tapped her phone, blasting the humiliating footage of Vincent soiling himself when Evelyn walked in.

The room erupted in laughter.

Even Evelyn, who hadn’t smiled in years, clutched her stomach, tears streaming down her face.

Vincent’s face twisted. He lunged, fist aimed at Vivian’s face. "You little—!"

Evelyn screamed, "Miss Viv, watch out!"

Vivian caught his wrist mid-air. One fluid twist, and Vincent was on the ground, groaning.

His eyes widened. "What the hell—?"

He wasn’t some amateur. He knew combat. And that move? That took years of training.

Vivian smirked down at him. "Just taking out the trash."

Then her stomach cramped.

Damn it. Not now.

She forced herself upright, masking the pain. "Consider this your lucky day. Walk away, or I send this video to Richard. Imagine his face when he sees his top dog whimpering like a kicked puppy."

Vincent paled. That video in Richard’s hands? A death sentence.

He scrambled up, snarling. "You got lucky. I’m not at full strength today."

He waved his men toward the door.

Then it hit him.

Why leave evidence?

He spun back, rage boiling over. "Grab that phone! Kill her!"

But before his men could move, a boot slammed into his back, sending him flying.
###Chapter 174

The moment Vivian Lockhart saw that cold, ruthless demeanor, she knew exactly who stood before her—Nathaniel Blackwood, the most feared man in Newport City.

But why would this aristocrat show up at her crumbling ancestral home?

Vincent Holloway had just been thrown to the ground by Vivian, and now someone else had kicked him hard enough to rattle his bones. He barely suppressed his fury, ready to unleash a string of curses—until he turned and met Nathaniel’s burning gaze. His face drained of color, and for the second time that day, he nearly pissed himself.

"Mr. Blackwood! W-what are you doing here?"

Nathaniel stared down at Vincent, sprawled on the floor like a worm. His brows furrowed, voice sharp with irritation. "You work for Richard Ashford?"

He vaguely recognized the man from a business deal—one of Richard’s top enforcers. The kind Richard kept close.

"Yes, sir! My name is Vincent Holloway. I’ve served Mr. Ashford for years. Meeting you during the Blackwood Group’s partnership with Kingsley Holdings was an honor. I’ve always admired you, and seeing you again is a privilege!"

Vincent was practically groveling, ready to kiss Nathaniel’s shoes if allowed. He knew Nathaniel’s status far surpassed Richard’s. Offending him wasn’t an option.

Nathaniel barely spared him a glance, his sharp eyes scanning the wreckage of Lockhart Manor—shattered furniture, overturned decor, chaos everywhere. His frown deepened.

"Explain this."

Vincent swallowed hard. "W-well… Mr. Ashford heard rumors that Lockhart Manor was haunted. The neighbors, even his friends, were terrified. He’s a righteous man—he ordered us to cleanse this place for everyone’s safety!"

"Bullshit."

Vivian felt her brain cells dying from the sheer audacity of his lies. Did he think they were idiots?

Clutching her aching abdomen, she scoffed. "Do you take me for a fool? Or are you implying Mr. Ashford is one? Using his name to justify this nonsense—you must have a death wish."

"Miss Lockhart, please understand. Mr. Ashford truly—"

Vincent didn’t believe his own words either, but what choice did he have?

Admit that Richard knew Vivian had returned to Lockhart Manor and sent him to eliminate her?

Even if they were divorced, Nathaniel wouldn’t stand by while his ex-wife was brutalized.

Nathaniel’s voice was ice. "So Richard sent you to clean up this 'dirty' place?"

Vincent paled. "N-no! That’s not what I meant!"

He was digging his own grave deeper with every word.

"You misunderstand, Mr. Blackwood! I only—I just—!"

Vincent studied Nathaniel’s expression, panic rising. No matter how he answered, it was wrong.

Vivian listened, irritation simmering. Somehow, Nathaniel’s words felt like an indirect insult.

Nathaniel’s foot slammed onto Vincent’s head. "Tell Richard I despise bullies. The deal between Blackwood Group and Kingsley Holdings is terminated."

"Y-yes, sir!"

Vincent didn’t dare argue. Signaling his men, they scrambled out like rats.

What a disaster. He hadn’t expected Nathaniel to swoop in like some white knight.

Weren’t exes supposed to hate each other? Why did these two keep crossing paths?

Nathaniel shoved his hands into his pockets, his expression unreadable as he studied Vivian. "You alright?"

Vivian wasn’t fooled. Even if her ex-husband had just played the hero, she wasn’t about to swoon.

She smirked. "No one visits without a reason, Mr. Blackwood. You stormed into my home with that arrogant attitude—did you expect a warm welcome? Get to the point."
###Chapter 175

Ethan didn't answer Vivian's question. Instead, he continued inspecting the villa with a critical eye.

"This layout is terrible. The hall is claustrophobic, the dome is hideous, and the staircase is a hazard."

"It needs a full demolition. The decor is outdated—looks like it's been here since the Victorian era. Even the engravings on the entrance pillars lack finesse. You should tear it all down and rebuild."

His arrogant critique left Vivian baffled.

Was this man delusional? Did he still think he had any say in her life?

"Do you really have nothing better to do, Ethan? Did you secretly get an interior design degree when I wasn’t looking? Stay out of my house!"

Ignoring her irritation, Ethan stood in the center of the living room, studying the landscape painting on the wall.

"This is impressive. The Night Shepherd, isn’t it? If it’s authentic, it’s worth a fortune."

Vivian was taken aback. She hadn’t expected Ethan to recognize the painting, let its value.

The artwork was the most prized possession in the villa, though few knew its significance. Despite multiple break-ins, thieves had overlooked it every time. It had been her father’s favorite, and gazing at it always brought him to mind.

For a fleeting moment, Ethan’s broad shoulders reminded her of the security she once felt with her father. Like an unshakable mountain, his presence made her feel protected—as if nothing could harm her while he was near.

What am I thinking? Vivian mentally shook herself.

Evelyn glanced between them, suppressing a smile. This was her first time meeting Ethan, and he was nothing like the cold-hearted monster Vivian had described. His protective actions and the way he looked at Vivian suggested there was more to their story.

Maybe their divorce was just a misunderstanding...

"Are you done? If so, get out!" Vivian snapped, eager to rid herself of his presence.

"Miss Lockhart, that’s no way to treat a guest!" Evelyn scolded. "Mr. Blackwood just saved us. The least we can do is offer him lunch."

Turning to Ethan, she asked warmly, "What would you like? I can prepare anything—even French cuisine."

Ethan considered her before replying, "Seafood. Pan-seared salmon with watercress, or crab linguine. And if you’re making soup, keep it light."

Vivian’s fists clenched.

"Are you serious, Ethan? This isn’t a five-star restaurant!"

She flailed her arms as if shooing away a pest. "Out! Now! You’re not welcome here!"

Ethan remained unmoved. "I don’t need your welcome."

His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "As long as you don’t mind, Madam."

Evelyn blinked, surprised by his unexpected charm. "Of course not! You were family once, and you’ve protected Miss Lockhart all these years. Let me show you what I can do."

With that, she grabbed the forgotten groceries and disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Vivian and Ethan in an awkward silence.
###Chapter 176

Vivian realized she was the only one feeling uneasy. Nathaniel appeared completely at ease, moving through the space as if it were his own. It perfectly illustrated that old saying: "Embarrassment only exists if you care about others' opinions."

Earlier, Vincent Holloway had trashed the entire living room, leaving chaos in his wake. Only the sofa area remained untouched.

Nathaniel settled gracefully onto the couch, crossing one leg over the other. His gaze fixed on Vivian. "How are you settling in? Adjusting to your new place?"

"What do you think? This is my home. Why wouldn’t I be comfortable here?"

Vivian glanced around, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "After four years of drifting, I’m finally back. There’s no place like home."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened slightly. His voice dropped to a murmur. "As you said, you still own half of Blackwood Villa. If you want to return, you can move back anytime. It’s your home too."

For a second, Vivian thought she’d misheard him. The warmth in her eyes vanished, replaced by cold disdain.

"Nathaniel, don’t play hypocrite now. Remember when you threw me out overnight to make room for Cassandra? Those weren’t your words back then."

A man’s fleeting affection meant nothing. Especially when Nathaniel didn’t truly love her—he just needed her help.

Vivian knew exactly why he was here, but she refused to acknowledge it. She wouldn’t give him what he wanted.

"I was wrong before. I didn’t realize Cassandra would be this unreasonable," Nathaniel admitted, disgust flashing in his eyes. Even from their first meeting, something about her had felt off—her sweet facade masking something far more calculating.

Unlike Cassandra, Vivian’s gaze was clear and bright, like untouched mountain springs.

Nathaniel couldn’t deny it—something in his chest stirred whenever he looked into her eyes.

"I had no idea she’d ruin Blackwood Villa like this. If I’d known, I never would’ve let her step foot inside."

He rarely stayed there, but he’d always loved the sunflowers in the garden. Now they were gone, replaced by dull, lifeless roses.

Everything that had once been Vivian’s was erased. The thought unsettled him more than he cared to admit.

"And?"

Vivian’s patience snapped. She cut straight to the point, her voice icy. "You know exactly how terrible your lover is. Yet here you are, begging me to spare her."

"Aren’t you the great Nathaniel Blackwood? Reduced to groveling at your ex-wife’s feet for a woman like her? Is that love?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, impressed despite himself. "Fine. Yes. I’m here for Cassandra today."

He didn’t waste time. "She’s still in the hospital, recovering from the shock. I want you to drop the charges."

Of course. Vivian’s chest tightened, though she’d expected this.

She inhaled deeply. "She stole and destroyed my things. The evidence is undeniable. Why should I let it go?"

With Nathaniel’s influence, he could’ve easily intervened—but Vivian had acted first. Her lawyer, Alexander Graves, had filed suit before Nathaniel could react.

Even with his power, he couldn’t openly defy the law. The only way out was for Vivian to withdraw the case.

Otherwise, Cassandra might actually face jail time.

Nathaniel’s patience frayed. His jaw tightened. "Name your price. What will it take for you to let her go?"
###Chapter 177

Vivian found Nathaniel's sudden mood swing laughable.

For a proud man like him, maintaining that gentle facade for his mistress must have been exhausting.

She tilted her chin up with a mocking half-smile. "Haven't I made myself clear? Just have your precious Cassandra kneel and apologize to me in front of every media outlet."

"Don't push it." Nathaniel's gaze turned icy.

Somehow, Vivian felt like a stranger to him now.

The old Vivian would never have been this ruthless.

"I told you—Cassandra is hospitalized with pregnancy complications. How could you demand she kneel?"

"Is that so?"

Vivian's fists clenched silently. Despite the stabbing pain in her chest, she kept her voice sharp. "If she can't kneel, then you do it for her. What's wrong, Mr. Blackwood? Won't you bend the knee for true love? How romantic."

Nothing mattered anymore. Let him think of her as cruel and heartless.

Four years of kindness had earned her nothing but his contempt. If that was the case, she'd rather be the villain.

Nathaniel's expression darkened with terrifying fury.

Her relentless attitude infuriated him. He'd lost all control over her—and that realization drove him mad.

"Cassandra was wrong, but she's suffered enough—"

He struggled to rein in his temper, speaking through gritted teeth. "You're not pregnant. You don't understand her pain. Name your price—money, resources, whatever. But if you dare hurt her, don't blame me for forgetting we were ever married."

Vivian laughed coldly.

His words ignited a fire in her chest. "Were we ever really married?" she spat.

Nathaniel was the most hypocritical, heartless man she'd ever met.

He'd saved her life just days ago. Now, he was threatening her for Cassandra's sake.

The wounds he left were invisible—but they cut deeper than any blade.

"I don't want your money. I want Cassandra to suffer. Threaten me all you want. Let's see who breaks first."

This was her declaration of war.

She had nothing left to lose.

Julian Montgomery was the best criminal lawyer in the country. If Vivian wanted, she could bury Cassandra under a mountain of charges. Eight years in prison? A decade? Entirely possible.

"You're being unreasonable. You'll regret this." Nathaniel's warning sounded more like a prophecy.

Then he left.

Evelyn Whitmore had spent all morning cooking.

The table was laden with Nathaniel's favorite dishes.

She'd once believed Vivian's ex-husband was dependable—that he could make her happy. She'd adored him, certain Vivian's parents would've approved.

That's why Evelyn was determined to reunite them.

"Lunch is ready!"

She carried out the final dish, only to find Vivian sitting alone.

"Where's Mr. Blackwood?"

"I kicked him out." Vivian sat down calmly and started eating as if nothing had happened.

"You what?" Evelyn sighed. She knew Vivian well enough to see through the act.

"Miss Vivian... I know you still have feelings for him. Have you considered remarriage? For the baby's sake?"
###Chapter 178

"We have feelings for each other?"

Vivian set down her fork with a quiet clink. A wry smile touched her lips. "Evelyn, you're usually so perceptive, but not this time."

Her voice turned sharp. "Do you know why Nathaniel suddenly showed up with all those grand gestures?"

"Because he still loves you and wants to reconcile?"

Vivian's laugh was bitter. "He came to beg for his mistress. That arrogant man stripped himself of dignity for that vile woman."

Her knuckles whitened around her wineglass. "Unforgivable. I'll never pardon that betrayal."

"What—" Evelyn's teacup froze mid-air. The image of the dignified Nathaniel Blackwood crumbling for some scheming woman turned her stomach.

"I can't believe he'd sink that low. A man of his standing should know better than to enable such behavior. There must be some mistake."

"Mistake?"

Vivian's smile turned icy. "Evelyn, you've never been in love. Let me educate you—love has no logic."

"The beloved can do no wrong. Clearly, I lacked whatever charm that woman possessed. Four years together, and he never looked at me like that."

Usually confident, Vivian only felt this small around Nathaniel and their broken marriage.

How could someone like her lose to a snake like Cassandra? No more self-pity. That chapter was closed.

Evelyn stayed silent. The wounds ran too deep. But seeing Vivian's lingering pain, she made a silent decision...

Nathaniel stormed out of Lockhart Manor like a thundercloud. His fury radiated in waves, keeping even his bravest employees at bay.

Blackwood Group's staff moved like frightened mice, barely daring to breathe.

Meanwhile, Oliver Prescott strolled into the CEO's office grinning. "Nate! You in there? Hellooo?"

The oppressive atmosphere hit him immediately.

"Mr. Prescott!" The secretary Rachel intercepted him urgently. "Mr. Blackwood isn't receiving visitors today. Perhaps—"

Oliver waved her off. "Relax, I'm his favorite. He'll always make time for me." He winked at Nathaniel's hunched form. "Right, Nate?"

"Get out."

Oliver coughed awkwardly. "So... bad day?"

Rachel whispered, "He was fine until returning from his ex-wife's place—"

"Ah." Oliver nodded sagely. "The world knows their story. Must be crushing to lose her permanently. The pressure's getting to him."

Nearly 80% of the company shipped Nathaniel and Vivian. Rachel, their biggest shipper, tracked their every move.

The consensus? Mr. Blackwood got owned by Mrs. Blackwood again. Employees exchanged sympathetic yet smug looks—karma was a bitch.

"Owned?" Oliver sighed dramatically. "Never thought sweet Vivian could wreck him like this. And here I was hoping he'd introduce me to some connections."

"Right? Mrs. Blackwood's the one person Mr. Blackwood can't control!"

Their synchronized sighing earned Nathaniel's glacial glare. "Don't you have jobs? Need more work?"

"No thanks!"

Oliver scrambled forward. "Wait! Serious business! The new Quantum-6 chip prototype—"

Nathaniel's pen snapped in half.
###Chapter 179

Nathaniel's jaw tightened when he heard those words. The memory of his last confrontation with Vivian flashed through his mind, reigniting his fury.

"State your business or get out. I won't repeat myself."

He turned back to his work, his entire demeanor turning glacial. The air around him grew so cold it felt like stepping into an arctic storm.

Nathan Prescott swallowed hard. Damn, Vivian really did a number on him.

He shot a desperate glance at Victoria Chen, silently pleading for backup. But she only gave him a polite smile before slipping out. "Mr. Prescott, feel free to chat with Mr. Blackwood. I have work to attend to."

And just like that—she abandoned him.

"Seriously, Victoria?!"

Nathan watched in disbelief as she closed the door behind her, leaving him alone with the human iceberg. He suddenly felt like sacrificial prey thrown into a lion's den.

Well, I'm already here. Might as well get it over with.

He cleared his throat dramatically.

Nathaniel didn’t even look up.

After an awkward silence, Nathan finally blurted out, "Look, man, it's just us here. If you're hurting, let it out. Burying yourself in work won’t fix anything. Cry if you need to—real men do that, you know."

Nathaniel lifted his gaze, unimpressed.

Nathan pressed on. "We're brothers. I saw the video—you begging your ex-wife to stay. Never thought you'd fall that hard for someone like Vivian. Not my type, but hey, love is love."

He shook his head, still baffled. How could Nathaniel, of all people, be so hung up on a woman like her?

"You’re a genius in business but clueless in love. Lucky for you, I’m an expert. Want me to teach you how to win her back?"

Nathaniel scoffed. "I was drunk. That video means nothing. And she’s my ex—stay out of it."

Nathan smirked. "Oh? That possessive tone says otherwise. Just admit it—you still want her."

"I don’t."

"Liar."

Nathaniel clenched his fists. Deep down, he knew it wasn’t about love—it was about control. He couldn’t stand that she’d walked away.

She was mine. She should still be mine.

His anger cooled into something sharper. More calculated.

"Fine," Nathaniel said, his voice dangerously smooth. "You claim you can help? Prove it."

Nathan grinned. "One month. I’ll have her wrapped around your finger again."

"Teach me."

Nathan hesitated, then smirked. "On one condition—you owe me after this."

"Done."

The instant agreement stunned him.

Oh, hell. He’s really gone for her.
###Chapter 180

Nathaniel snatched his leather-bound journal. With deliberate strokes, he penned "The Art of Winning Vivian Back" in bold letters.

Oliver choked on his whiskey, barely suppressing a laugh.

"Nathaniel Blackwood, the so-called Ice King of Wall Street." He wiped his mouth with a smirk. "Who knew you'd turn into such a lovesick puppy?"

"Love requires strategy, not impulse." Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "I'm compiling data points. Your advice will undergo rigorous analysis before implementation."

"You're treating this like a hostile takeover!" Oliver's glass hit the marble counter with a clink. "Since when does courtship need spreadsheets?"

Nathaniel's steel-gray eyes flashed. "Everything worth doing requires precision. Fail me, and your startup's IPO gets buried."

Oliver's amusement vanished. The man wasn't joking.

A slow whistle escaped him. Vivian Lockhart had really gotten under Nathaniel's skin. He'd underestimated the heiress—what he'd assumed was demure innocence now seemed like calculated resistance.

"Alright, listen close." Oliver straightened his tie. "With your... unique circumstances, we'll need nuclear-level tactics."

Nathaniel's pen hovered expectantly.

"Rule one: Bombardment." Oliver gestured like a general. "Flood her notifications—morning coffee selfies, lunchtime memes, midnight 'accidental' voice notes."

"Absurd." Nathaniel's pen snapped. "I run a Fortune 500 company."

"Then enjoy dying alone." Oliver shrugged. "Even CEOs piss. Text her then."

The silence stretched.

"...She blocked me."

Oliver's laughter echoed through the penthouse. "The mighty Nathaniel Blackwood? Blocked?" He clutched his stomach. "This is priceless!"

A crystal decanter shattered against the wall.

"Fix. It." Nathaniel's growl could frost glass.

Wiping tears away, Oliver composed himself. "Relax. We'll escalate to Rule Two: Strategic Incursions." He leaned in. "Where does she get her lattes?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with understanding.

"Her yoga studio's schedule?" Oliver continued. "Charity galas? That insufferable cat café?" A wicked grin spread. "We'll make 'coincidences' your new religion."

The journal's pages rustled as Nathaniel scribbled furiously. Outside, Manhattan's skyline glittered—unaware of the corporate titan currently plotting romantic warfare with the intensity of a military campaign.

Oliver watched with morbid fascination. This would either be legendary... or a disaster of epic proportions. Either way, he needed popcorn.
###Chapter 181

Nathaniel Blackwood continued.

"If she blocks you, get a new number. Text her whenever you can. Flirt. Make her smile."

"Then comes Phase Two."

"Romance."

"Every woman loves romance, especially dreamers like your ex-wife. Master this, and she's yours."

Ethan Blackwood pushed his glasses up and scribbled notes furiously. His focus was absolute.

He even raised his hand. "How?"

"Different lesson. No time today. Watch rom-coms—Korean ones. Study the male leads. I'll make you slides later."

"Fine."

Ethan nodded. "Continue," he commanded, as if Nathaniel worked for him.

"Phase Three: Retreat. After chasing hard, pull back. Push-pull dynamics. Critical stage. Mess up, and she bolts."

"Phase Four: Investment. Pour your heart out. No tactic beats genuine emotion. When she sees your sincerity? Game over."

"Phase Five: Close. Reach this stage, and victory's yours."

Nathaniel exhaled. "That's it. Review. Ask questions. But remember—theory means nothing without practice."

Ethan scanned his notes, brow furrowed.

Cold. Logical. Zero courtship experience. Only rejection.

This felt... useful. Like discovering a new language. He needed it to work.

Seeing Ethan's mood lift, Nathaniel seized the moment. "Your turn. I taught you. Now, my favor."

"What?"

"That death at my club. The family won't settle. Trial's coming. Evidence looks bad. Only Julian Montgomery wins these cases. Get him for me."

Nathaniel's face tightened.

Jail? Unthinkable. But if this got out, his father would lock him up anyway. He couldn't lose.

Every top lawyer said it was hopeless. Only Julian could save him.

The hearing had been delayed too many times. He needed Julian. Now.

"Can't help."

Ethan shrugged. "Not the boss anymore."

"I know. Your ex-wife is."

Nathaniel grimaced. "You two have history. Pull strings."

"If I could, would I need dating lessons?"

Ethan sighed.

His ex was ruthless. Nathaniel wanted favors? He hadn't even fixed his own mess.

Had he known those "useless lawyers" at Blackwood Legal were this good, he'd never have handed over the firm.

In weeks, they'd worked miracles for Vivian.

"Right. She blocked you. I'd have better luck. At least I'm not blocked..."

Nathaniel rubbed his chin. "Maybe I should pursue her. Succeed, and she lends me her lawyer, yes?"

Ethan's glare could kill.

Nathaniel backtracked fast. "Kidding! Wouldn't dare. She's trouble."

With Ethan useless, Nathaniel was desperate.

"Fine. I'll handle it."

He turned to leave—then paused. "One more thing. Dominic Harrington's engagement to Olivia Sinclair is next week. You going?"
###Chapter 182

Ethan Blackwood's chiseled features remained impassive. Only the slight arch of his brow betrayed any reaction as he regarded Nathan Prescott's cautious expression.

"Why wouldn't I go?"

Dominic Harrington, Nathan, and he had sworn brotherhood years ago. Their bond ran deeper than blood.

Now that their eldest brother was getting engaged, it was only natural for him to attend.

Nathan clearly thought Ethan was putting on a brave front. He clapped Ethan on the shoulder. "Dom said it's fine if you skip it. He gets it. I mean, the whole thing with you, him, and Olivia... It's messy."

"Nothing messy about it."

Ethan's tone was ice-cold. "One's my brother. The other's an old friend. They're engaged. Of course I'll be there."

"But—" Nathan exhaled sharply, his expression dripping with pity.

To him, Ethan's indifference was obviously an act.

Olivia Sinclair had been Ethan's first love. Watching her marry his sworn brother? The pain must be unbearable.

Ethan had it all—wealth, power, looks—but love had always been his downfall. First love gone. Wife gone. The man couldn't catch a break.

Hopefully, the "Six-Step Seduction Guide" Nathan had just taught him would help. Maybe then he'd stop being so tragically unlucky in love.

Once Nathan left, Ethan studied his notes intently, his dark brows knitting together. "Step one..."

Vivian Lockhart and Evelyn Whitmore returned from their riverside stroll that afternoon.

A fleet of delivery trucks blocked the villa's entrance. Workers in coveralls milled about, searching for someone to speak to.

"Who are you looking for?" Vivian called out.

One man perked up. "Miss Lockhart?"

"That's me."

Her gaze flicked to the trucks behind him, suspicion flaring.

"Mr. Blackwood purchased furniture, appliances, and decor for you. High-end items. Please verify everything on this list and sign here."

He handed her a thick stack of papers.

Vivian skimmed the inventory—sofas, TVs, vases. Enough to stock a luxury showroom.

Evelyn whistled. "Your ex-husband? Generous. Not the heartless bastard you described."

That only stoked Vivian's irritation.

"Generous? He's desperate. His mistress is facing jail time. This is a bribe."

She shoved the papers back. "Return everything."

The workers paled. "These are non-refundable, Miss Lockhart! Don't make our jobs harder!"

"Each piece costs tens of thousands. The total exceeds a million. Just accept them," another pleaded.

Vivian's lips curled. "You're right. How kind of Mr. Blackwood. I'll take them."

Relief washed over the man. "Wonderful! Please sign—"

"Once I do, these belong to me. I can do whatever I want with them, yes?"

"Of course!"

"Perfect."

She scribbled her signature, then dropped the bomb. "Sell everything to a secondhand dealer at half price. Keep anything above that as commission."

The man gaped. "But—"

"Not interested? Plenty of other dealers will be."

"We'll do it!"

Brand-new luxury goods at half price? The profit margin was insane. Who would say no?

Evelyn bit her lip. "Miss Vivian, isn't this too much? What if Mr. Blackwood finds out?"

"Not my problem." Vivian grinned. "This villa cost a fortune. Now someone's handing me cash? I'd be a fool to refuse."

That evening, Ethan received the update.

"She accepted them?"

A smirk tugged at his lips. Maybe she wasn't as stubborn as he thought.

Then the worker stammered, "She—she sold everything to a pawnshop immediately, sir. We couldn't stop her."

Ethan's blood ran cold.

"She WHAT?"

+15 BONUS

"Clever girl, Vivian Lockhart. You'll pay for this."
###Chapter 183

Ethan Blackwood reached for his phone, fingers moving automatically to dial Vivian Lockhart's number. Then it hit him—she'd blocked him. The realization made his blood boil.

"Rachel!" His voice cut through the office like a whip.

Rachel Miles stepped inside cautiously. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Give me your phone."

"My—my phone?"

Confused but obedient, she handed it over.

Ethan wasted no time redialing Vivian's number.

Three rings. Then—

"Hello?"

Vivian's voice was light, almost cheerful. Of course she was happy. She'd just swindled him out of hundreds of thousands.

"Sounds like you're enjoying yourself," Ethan said, jaw tight.

The moment she recognized his voice, her tone shifted. "I'm doing just fine, thanks."

"Impressive business sense. Half a million gone in seconds. I underestimated you."

"Flattery won't get you unblocked," she shot back. "But if you're feeling generous, I could use more for my renovations."

Ethan clenched his teeth. The woman who used to bend to his every whim was now driving him insane.

"Since I just funded your little project, the least you could do is unblock me." He forced calm into his voice. That money had to be good for something.

"No." Her refusal was instant. "It was a gift. Want it back? Sue me. Good luck winning, though."

"You—"

The line went dead.

She'd hung up on him.

Calling again would be pathetic. She wouldn’t answer anyway.

Fine. If she wanted to play games, he’d play.

"Rachel," he snapped. "Get me a new SIM card. Now."

Rachel had heard everything. Watching the mighty Ethan Blackwood reduced to this? Karma was a bitch.

Love turns even kings into fools.

Lockhart Manor

Vivian tossed her phone aside after hanging up. The satisfaction of irritating Ethan faded fast, leaving something hollow.

Her ex-husband, groveling—not for her, but for another woman. It stung more than she’d admit.

Four years of playing the perfect wife. Swallowing every insult. And for what? A cheating bastard who picked Cassandra Delacroix over her.

Not even someone worthy. Just a scheming, two-faced—

Ugh.

She went to bed early, but sleep wouldn’t come.

Moonlight spilled through the window. She grabbed her phone, scrolling absently until a notification caught her eye—a new friend request.

The profile picture: a lone moon over dark waves. The message: "Up for a chat?"

She almost ignored it. But boredom won. She accepted.

The account was blank. No friends. No posts. Freshly made.

Her first thought: Ethan.

But no. The CEO of Blackwood Group wouldn’t stoop to this.

The stranger stayed silent. Curiosity got the better of her.

"Do I know you?"

The status flickered to typing...
###Chapter 184

The chat remained stubbornly silent.

Vivian's fingers hovered over the screen, irritation prickling her skin. "Hello? Are you even there?"

Nothing. Not even the telltale "typing" indicator.

Ghosted.

The silence only fueled her determination.

This stranger clearly thought too highly of himself. Probably some spoiled rich boy accustomed to women fawning over him.

Perfect. She needed an outlet for her pent-up frustration anyway.

Her phone glowed in the darkened bedroom as she unleashed a torrent of words.

"Listen kid, ever met someone who makes your blood boil?"

"You're young, so maybe not. But let me tell you about this absolute joke of a man."

"Let's call him The Clown. Because that's what he is - a pathetic, walking circus act."

Across town, Nathaniel's office windows reflected the city's glittering skyline. His phone buzzed incessantly against the mahogany desk.

He should've ignored it. But something made him look.

"The Clown?" His jaw tightened. Was this some elaborate taunt? Did she know it was him?

Vivian's messages kept coming.

"Here's the kicker - this clown knows exactly how toxic his little mistress is, yet he still worships the ground she walks on. Tell me that's not textbook stupidity."

Nathaniel's grip on his phone turned white-knuckled.

"But here's what really kills me," Vivian continued, "I'm over him. So why does it still hurt? Is heartbreak like radiation poisoning or something?"

The words hit harder than they should.

His thumb hovered over the keyboard. What could he say? That Cassandra carried his brother's last wish? That every indulgence was payment for a life debt?

Instead, he turned to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The moon hung heavy and luminous over Newport City.

He snapped a photo. Sent it without caption.

When the image appeared on Vivian's screen, something unclenched in her chest.

"The moon's beautiful tonight," she typed back, surprised by her own sincerity. "Hope he sees it too."

Sleep came easier after that.

Neither acknowledged the unspoken meaning behind those words - the secret language of lovers too afraid to say "I love you" outright.

Some truths were better left floating in the silent space between messages.
###Chapter 185

The sterile white walls of the OB-GYN ward closed in around Cassandra Delacroix.

She gripped the hospital sheets, her knuckles turning white. The evidence against her was overwhelming—witnesses, security footage, everything.

Bail had been granted, but two officers stood guard outside her door.

One word from Isabella Lockhart, and she'd be serving three years behind bars.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding might delay her sentence, but not erase it.

A criminal record would destroy everything.

Why had she ever underestimated Isabella?

Her phone lay silent beside her. Nathaniel Blackwood hadn't answered a single call.

Would he even lift a finger to save her now?

The door clicked open. Her doctor entered, expression grim.

"Miss Delacroix," he said quietly, shutting the door. "Your test results... there's a complication."

Her stomach dropped. "What's wrong with my baby?"

"It's... perhaps we should wait for Mr. Blackwood—"

"No." She sat up sharply. "Tell me now. It's my body, my decision."

The doctor hesitated, then handed her the report. "We've detected a severe genetic abnormality. If carried to term, your child would likely have profound cognitive impairments. We strongly recommend—"

"That's impossible!" Cassandra's voice cracked. "My baby was perfectly healthy last week! Both parents are fine—this has to be a mistake!"

"Miss Delacroix, please—"

"Don't 'please' me!" She threw the papers aside. "You want me to abort Nathaniel Blackwood's heir? Do you have any idea what his family would do to you?"

This child was her only lifeline.

(Though privately, she wasn't entirely sure Nathaniel was the father. That drunken night at Velvet Room... had there been others?)

The doctor paled. "Termination isn't just about the child's quality of life. There's a high probability the fetus won't survive the third trimester. Continuing this pregnancy could endanger you—"

"Enough!" Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "If my baby lives, it's a miracle. If not, it's fate. But you will not breathe a word of this to anyone."

She leaned forward, eyes burning. "One whisper about the Blackwood heir being defective, and I'll make sure you never practice medicine again."

The doctor swallowed hard. "Understood, Miss Delacroix. Your... discretion will be respected."

As he hurried out, Cassandra collapsed against the pillows.

She had exactly one chance left.

And she'd gamble everything on it.
###Chapter 186

The doctor's footsteps faded down the corridor. Cassandra pressed a hand against her flat stomach, her lips twisting in disgust. "Pathetic," she hissed. "Even with the Blackwood bloodline, you're defective. Might as well make yourself useful before you die."

The medical report couldn't be clearer. This fetus wouldn't survive birth regardless.

Better to orchestrate a tragic accident than face the humiliation of a stillbirth. At least this way, she could weaponize its demise.

Her nails dug into the hospital gown as a plan crystallized. That sanctimonious Isabella Lockhart had been begging for a confrontation. What if the stress caused a miscarriage?

Nathaniel would destroy the woman who killed his brother's heir.

Cassandra's mouth curved into a satisfied smile. Her fingers traced gentle circles where life flickered weakly. "Do this last favor for Mommy, darling. Make your death count."

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. "Cassandra Delacroix? Visitor."

Her pulse jumped. Nathaniel had finally come!

She smoothed her hair with trembling hands, pasting on her most vulnerable expression as the door swung open.

The stranger in the doorway wasn't her lover.

Cassandra's smile died. "Who the hell are you?"

"Evelyn Whitmore." The older woman offered a polite nod. "I serve the Lockhart family."

Isabella's spy. Cassandra's spine stiffened. "Did that bitch send you to gloat?"

"I came alone." Evelyn's gaze dropped meaningfully to Cassandra's abdomen. "To discuss your... situation. Mr. Blackwood and Miss Lockhart belong together. Continuing this charade helps no one."

A servant daring to lecture her? Cassandra nearly laughed. Then inspiration struck.

Her shoulders slumped in feigned defeat. "You think I want this? The man hates me." Her hand fluttered over her stomach. "But this child ties me to him. If only..."

"If only what?" Evelyn leaned forward.

"If only I could end it." Cassandra let tears well up. "Nathaniel has me watched. No clinic will touch me."

The nanny's expression shifted. After a long pause, she murmured, "There might be another way."
###Chapter 187

Evelyn Whitmore came from generations of physicians. She knew every technique for nurturing pregnancies.

She also knew all the methods to terminate them.

But her moral compass had never allowed her to perform such cruel procedures.

Yet if it meant reuniting Vivian and Nathaniel, she'd damn her soul without hesitation.

"Miss Delacroix, are you absolutely certain? If you truly wish to proceed, I can prepare an herbal concoction. Painless. No future fertility complications."

Evelyn studied Cassandra's face intently.

She would only proceed with explicit consent. This decision belonged solely to the mother.

"I'm certain." Cassandra's voice held steady conviction. "Every child deserves loving parents. A father who cherishes both mother and child. This...this was never meant to be."

"Your wisdom honors you, Miss Delacroix."

Evelyn felt her reservations ease. This wasn't the villainess Vivian described.

Nathaniel's taste in women had never failed before.

"Wait here. I'll prepare the infusion immediately."

Evelyn hurried to the hospital's traditional medicine wing. Within the hour, she returned with a steaming thermos.

"Here. Mild cramping at worst. One bathroom visit should conclude everything."

She offered the thermos with steady hands. The Whitmore family recipes never failed.

Cassandra stared at the container without touching it. Suddenly her voice sharpened. "You swear Vivian will drop all charges if I do this?"

Evelyn blinked at the abrupt volume change. "Of course. You're clearly not malicious—just momentarily misguided. Once Nathaniel and Vivian reconcile—"

Cassandra's gaze flicked to the wall clock. "I'm frightened. Will you...help me drink it?"

"Of course."

Evelyn understood a mother's anguish. She unscrewed the thermos, stepping closer. "Close your eyes. The bitterness won't linger—"

Cassandra's demeanor shattered. She recoiled violently. "NO! Don't touch my baby!"

"Please take it away! I won't—I can't—"

Evelyn froze. "Miss Delacroix? Let me—"

"HELP! SHE'S TRYING TO KILL MY CHILD!"

Cassandra bolted past Evelyn toward the doorway's looming silhouette.

"Save me, Nathaniel! Vivian sent her with poison!"
###Chapter 188

Evelyn Whitmore spun around to find Nathaniel Blackwood looming in the doorway, his piercing gaze freezing her in place.

"Mr. Blackwood. I-"

Her words caught in her throat. The steaming abortion pills in her hand became damning evidence. No plausible explanation came to mind.

Cassandra Delacroix cowered behind Nathaniel, perfecting her damsel-in-distress act. "Vivian sent you, didn't she?" she sobbed dramatically. "I know I messed up by getting involved with Nathaniel, but my baby's innocent!"

Tears streamed down Cassandra's face as she clutched her stomach. "This child is everything to me! Tell Vivian if she wants revenge, take it out on me - not my unborn baby!"

Evelyn's face flushed crimson with rage. "That's not what happened! You suggested terminating the pregnancy yourself! Stop playing the victim!"

"Liar!" Cassandra shrieked. "I'd never harm my baby! You threatened me - said Vivian would have me arrested unless I took those pills. When I refused, you tried forcing them down my throat!"

Evelyn's hands trembled. She'd never encountered such masterful manipulation. The sheer audacity made her pulse pound dangerously.

Now she understood Vivian's warnings. Cassandra Delacroix was pure evil wrapped in angelic packaging.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn pleaded, "don't believe her lies. None of what she's saying is true. I would never-"

"Enough."

Nathaniel's voice cut like ice. His glacial stare pinned Evelyn in place. "Was this Vivian's idea?"

"No! Vivian knows nothing about this. Please don't blame her, she's-"

"So this was your doing?" Nathaniel's tone dropped dangerously. "You admit attempting to destroy a Blackwood heir?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. She couldn't deny her original intent, though the circumstances had twisted beyond recognition.

"I did suggest termination, but-"

"I've heard all I need." Nathaniel turned to the waiting officers. "Attempted harm to a Blackwood heir. Motive established. Witnesses present. You know what to do."

The officers snapped into action, cuffing Evelyn with practiced efficiency. "Attempted assault is a criminal offense. You're under arrest."

"Criminal offense?" Evelyn stared dumbly at the gleaming handcuffs. This had spiraled far beyond her expectations.

"Wait! This is a misunderstanding! I only wanted to help Cassandra move on! You and Vivian still love each other - your marriage can be saved if-"

"Remove her."

Nathaniel's dismissal was absolute. Evelyn's desperate pleas turned to bitter laughter. "Now I understand why Vivian insists on divorcing you. A man like you doesn't deserve her love!"

After Evelyn's departure, Cassandra's mask slipped into a triumphant smirk.

She clung to Nathaniel's arm. "Thank heaven you arrived when you did! Vivian's thirst for revenge knows no bounds - targeting an innocent baby? How could she-"

"Drop the act." Nathaniel wrenched his arm free. "Your performance disgusts me."

Cassandra's smile faltered. He knew Evelyn was innocent? Then why...?

Nathaniel answered her unspoken question with a chilling smile. "You want to know why I played along?"
###Chapter 189

Blackwood Estate.

Vivian sat by the second-floor window, gazing outside for what felt like hours. Still no sign of Evelyn.

She pulled out her phone again. The call went straight to voicemail, just like the last five attempts.

"Strange. It's nearly sunset. Where could she be?"

That morning, Vivian had found a note on the kitchen counter. Evelyn's neat handwriting said she'd handle some personal business and return soon. No need to worry.

But now darkness crept across the sky, and still no Evelyn. No calls. No texts.

Something wasn't right.

Vivian's fingers tightened around her phone. With everything happening lately, too many people wanted revenge against their family.

The fading sunlight decided it. Vivian grabbed her leather jacket and headed for the door.

The silver Aston Martin parked at the gates made her freeze.

Nathaniel leaned against the hood, his silhouette stretched long by the amber streetlights. A cigarette dangled from his fingers, smoke curling into the chilly evening air.

Her traitorous heart skipped a beat.

Of all people, why him? Why now?

Vivian schooled her features into indifference and walked right past him without acknowledgment.

Nathaniel stubbed out his cigarette with deliberate slowness. The trash can lid clanged shut as he fell into step behind her.

His shadow swallowed hers whole.

Vivian quickened her pace. After three blocks, she whirled around abruptly. "Got a stalker kink, Blackwood?"

Nathaniel barely avoided colliding with her. The scant inches between them crackled with tension.

He smirked. "Dangerous neighborhood for midnight strolls, Mrs. Blackwood."

"Don't blame victims for predators' crimes." Her nails dug into her palms. "Then again, I shouldn't expect moral clarity from a man who sleeps with vipers like Cassandra Delacroix."

Nathaniel's smile deepened. The jealousy in her voice pleased him more than he'd admit. "You always get so... passionate when Cassandra's mentioned."

"Because I despise her."

"Is that all?" He stepped closer. "Or do you hate what she represents?"

Vivian retreated. "What's gotten into you tonight?"

"What if I told you my relationship with Cassandra isn't what you think?" His gaze held hers. "That I protect her for reasons you don't know?"

"What reasons?" Vivian's breath hitched.

The streetlight flickered above them, casting shadows across Nathaniel's unreadable expression.
###Chapter 190

"It doesn't matter."

Nathaniel remained silent.

Some truths must remain buried for everyone's safety.

"You only need to understand my relationship with Cassandra isn't what you imagine. There's no need to torment her out of petty jealousy."

Vivian burst into laughter.

She was laughing at his arrogance. His cruelty.

How could any man say something so shameless to his ex-wife?

Cassandra Delacroix was clearly the villain here, yet from the start of this conversation, Nathaniel had been defending her while painting Vivian as the unreasonable one!

"You're hilarious, Nathaniel. You actually think I'm sending Cassandra to prison because I'm still in love with you? Jealous she stole you away?"

"Isn't that obvious?"

Nathaniel's voice turned icy.

Though inexperienced in love, he'd encountered enough women to recognize their motives.

"Wrong. This has nothing to do with you." Vivian smirked. "I'm simply vindictive. Cassandra kept provoking me, so naturally I'll make her pay."

No saint. No martyr. When attacked, Vivian always struck back harder.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "You weren't like this before."

"Because I was blind. Stupid. An excellent actress."

She no longer cared what he thought of her. "I'm done playing the perfect Blackwood daughter-in-law. Pretending to be gentle. Enduring your mother's cruelty. Suffocating in that prison of a mansion. Waiting like a pathetic puppy for you to come home!"

Those frozen, hollow days held no warmth. A past she'd rather forget.

"Let me be clear - I'm not kind. When my inner monster awakens, I might devour your precious mistress alive. Instead of wasting time here, you should hire better lawyers to shorten her sentence!"

Her words dripped with challenge.

She wanted to see how far Nathaniel would go to protect Cassandra.

His face hardened.

Before him stood an untamed leopard baring its claws. Uncontrollable. Infuriating.

"No room for negotiation?" His voice dropped dangerously.

"None whatsoever."

Vivian tilted her chin up. "I gave you a chance - one public apology on your knees. You refused. Now you'll see my true colors - petty, vicious, and ruthless."

She knew exactly how to handle snakes like Cassandra.

Show mercy now, and the viper would strike deadlier next time. Vivian wasn't that naive.

Nathaniel's shadow merged with hers on the floor. His voice turned lethal. "Then you'd better tell your lawyer to prepare your nanny's defense too. Murder carries heavier penalties than burglary."
###Chapter 191

Vivian's face darkened instantly. "So it was you," she hissed. "What have you done to Evelyn?"

Nathaniel's expression remained icy. "You should be asking what your nanny did first."

His voice was sharp as he continued, "Evelyn tried to force Cassandra to abort her child. Are you seriously going to pretend you knew nothing about this?"

He exhaled sharply before adding, "Here's my offer—I release Evelyn, and you drop the charges against Cassandra."

Nathaniel believed he was being more than generous.

That child was his late brother's only legacy. If anyone else had dared what Evelyn did, they would've vanished without a trace by now.

"Absolutely not!"

Vivian shook her head, her voice firm. "I know Evelyn. She would never do something like that!"

She crossed her arms. "As for Cassandra—yes, I want her behind bars. But I would never harm her child. Even if convicted, pregnant women aren't imprisoned immediately. She'd serve her sentence after giving birth and weaning the baby. The child would be safe."

As a mother herself, Vivian would never be so heartless.

Her words made Nathaniel's cold expression flicker slightly.

He knew Vivian wasn't truly cruel. She was just trying to provoke him.

"I believe you," he conceded. "And I believe your nanny. So let's end this now."

He repeated his terms. "Drop the charges, and Evelyn walks free."

Vivian let out a bitter laugh. "How noble of you, Nathaniel. Acting like you're doing me some grand favor!"

Her eyes flashed with defiance. "If you truly believe we're innocent, why not just release her? Why force me to withdraw the charges?"

"Stop being unreasonable!"

Nathaniel's patience was wearing thin.

Why was she so impossible to reason with? He didn't know how to handle her stubbornness anymore.

"There's nothing I despise more than threats," Vivian spat, her fists clenched. "And you're doing this for that woman? Fine. See you in court. Let the judge decide!"

Once again, they parted in anger.

Later, after calming down, Vivian called Alexander Graves.

After hearing her out, Alexander responded confidently, "Don't worry, Vivian. I'll handle this. I'll get Evelyn out—but first, I need to speak with her directly."

Within the hour, they met at the detention center.

A guard led them to Evelyn's cell, muttering, "Ten minutes. That's all you get."

Evelyn, nearing sixty, sat hunched in a corner, looking frail and exhausted.

"Evelyn!"

Vivian rushed to the barred door, her voice trembling.

Evelyn startled, then hurried over, gripping the bars. "Miss Vivian! You shouldn't be here—this place is terrible for you. Go home!"

"We don't have time," Vivian insisted. "Tell us everything. Now."

Evelyn hesitated, then confessed.

"So you really did try to make Cassandra take abortion pills?" Vivian asked, stunned.

"I did." Evelyn lifted her chin, resigned. "I wanted you and Mr. Blackwood to reconcile. That child couldn't exist if that were to happen."

She closed her eyes. "If it means your happiness, I'd gladly rot in here."

"Evelyn, you've made a huge mistake!"

Vivian's chest tightened, but she couldn't bring herself to scold the woman who'd raised her.

Alexander adjusted his glasses, calm as ever. "It's not hopeless. We can still win this. Trust me."

His confidence eased Vivian's panic.

If any other lawyer said that, she'd assume they were bluffing. But Alexander never made promises he couldn't keep.

"How soon can we get her out? Can we post bail?"

Alexander shook his head. "Given the charges? No. But..."

He smirked. "Want to add five more years to Cassandra's sentence while we're at it?"

"Right now, I just want Evelyn safe."

"Do as I say," Alexander said, snapping his fingers, "and not only will Evelyn walk free—Cassandra will wish she'd never crossed you."
###Chapter 192

Vivian and Julian stepped out of the detention center.

Vivian couldn't contain herself any longer. "You mentioned there's a way to prove Evelyn's innocence while making Cassandra pay even more severely? What exactly do I need to do?"

"It's simpler than you think."

Julian adjusted his tie. "If Evelyn isn't lying, then her intent to harm Cassandra can't be proven. That means no criminal charges. In fact, she could sue Cassandra for defamation instead."

"If Evelyn's health deteriorates during this period—especially if Cassandra's actions caused emotional distress—then Cassandra could face criminal charges too. Legally speaking, psychological trauma carries just as heavy a penalty as physical harm."

Vivian absorbed every word. "So if I can prove Evelyn told the truth—or that Cassandra lied—we win?"

"Exactly."

Julian continued, "My advice? Find concrete evidence that Cassandra fabricated her story. That way, we counter-sue for defamation. Witness testimony is subjective. Hard evidence carries far more weight in court."

"Easy. I know exactly what to do."

Vivian grinned, impressed. "Julian Montgomery, you're a genius."

She'd never been more grateful for demanding Blackwood Legal in her divorce settlement from Nathaniel. With their top lawyers on her side, no legal battle—administrative, civil, or criminal—stood a chance.

The next morning.

Vivian arrived at Cassandra's hospital room just after dawn.

Two officers still guarded the door.

Cassandra, convinced freedom was imminent, hummed loudly enough to echo down the hallway.

"Someone's cheerful."

Vivian leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, smirking.

Cassandra froze mid-eyeliner stroke. Seeing Vivian's reflection in the mirror made her jerk around, face paling. "You! How did you get in here?"

"Why so jumpy? We're practically sisters—you're Nathaniel's new flame, I'm the ex-wife. No need for hostility."

Vivian's smile dripped sarcasm.

"Sisters?" Cassandra scoffed, instantly defensive. "We're mortal enemies. One of us won't survive this. What do you want?"

"Relax. I just came to deliver some news."

Vivian's tone turned icy. "I have proof of Evelyn's innocence. Your charges just upgraded to defamation. Her psych eval came back—level three emotional trauma. Congratulations. If convicted, you're looking at five years minimum."

Cassandra's makeup brush clattered to the floor. "You're bluffing. The officers heard her threaten me!"

"Witnesses versus hard evidence? The law favors the latter."

Vivian's confidence was unshakable.

Cassandra's hands trembled. "What... what evidence?"
###Chapter 193

Vivian gestured toward the security camera mounted on the wall. "Secrets don't stay hidden forever. Lucky for us, your little crime was caught on tape."

Cassandra froze for a second before bursting into laughter. "That's your big evidence? Surveillance footage?" She smirked, flipping her hair. "Go ahead, take it to court. Let’s see who the judge believes."

Vivian hadn’t expected such confidence. Clearly, Cassandra had already tampered with the footage.

But that wasn’t a problem.

Vivian could retrieve deleted files in minutes.

"Since you’re so sure of yourself," Vivian said coolly, "we’ll see what happens at the trial in three days."

With that, she turned and walked away.

Three days. That’s all she needed.

Cassandra would pay for what she’d done.

The elevator doors slid open, and Vivian nearly collided with Nathaniel and his mother, Eleanor Whitmore.

Their eyes locked. A storm of unspoken emotions passed between them.

Eleanor’s face twisted in disgust. "What are you doing here, you wretched girl? Here to finish what your nanny started?"

"Is this your hospital?" Vivian shot back. "Do I need your permission to be here?"

"You—!"

Eleanor’s hand flew up, ready to strike.

Nathaniel caught her wrist. "Enough."

"Enough?" Eleanor hissed, yanking against his grip. "Have you lost your mind? She’s trying to ruin us! Your child could be born behind bars!"

"I’ll handle it," Nathaniel said, voice icy.

"How? If it were up to me, she’d have been dealt with long ago!"

Nathaniel didn’t budge. "Leave."

The command wasn’t for his mother—it was for Vivian.

She didn’t move.

Was this some kind of act? A ploy to make her drop the charges?

It wouldn’t work.

"See you in court," she said flatly, then walked away without another glance.

Only when she was gone did Nathaniel release Eleanor.

"You’re going to be the death of me!" Eleanor snapped, raising her hand—but she couldn’t bring herself to hit him. Instead, she exhaled sharply. "What’s wrong with you? Ever since the divorce, you act like she’s still your wife. Is she blackmailing you?"

"Cassandra crossed a line," Nathaniel said. "Vivian has every right to retaliate. She’s not part of this family anymore. We can’t control her."

Eleanor opened her mouth—then shut it.

He was right.

The timid girl they’d once known was gone.

Vivian Lockhart was a force now—CEO of Lockhart Enterprises, chairwoman of the Tech Association, running Blackwood Legal with ruthless efficiency.

If Eleanor had known this was who Vivian really was…

Maybe she wouldn’t have pushed for that divorce.
###Chapter 194

Vivian stepped out of the hospital and hailed a cab straight to Lockhart Manor.

Her fingers clutched a USB drive containing the surveillance footage she'd managed to download from the hospital records.

Back in her study, she transferred the files to her computer and began scanning through the footage from that fateful day.

As expected, what should've been ten hours of continuous recording had been reduced to less than sixty minutes. The damning evidence was systematically erased.

Only carefully selected clips remained - every frame designed to paint Margaret as the villain, perfectly supporting Cassandra's claim that she'd forced the abortion.

"Clever move, Cassandra Delacroix."

Vivian adjusted her glasses calmly. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she attempted to breach the hospital's cloud storage system.

Most public institutions like hospitals maintained cloud backups of their surveillance footage.

If the original files existed anywhere, they'd be there.

But the hospital's security protocols had been upgraded with military-grade encryption. After thirty minutes of failed attempts, the system even started tracing her IP.

"Damn it!"

The silent room echoed with furious keystrokes. This was a digital battlefield, and the tension was palpable.

This level of security wasn't Cassandra's handiwork. That spoiled socialite couldn't code her way out of a paper bag.

Which meant only one person could be behind this - Nathaniel Blackwood.

The computer's blue glow cast shadows across Vivian's face, highlighting her bitter disappointment.

So this was how far Nathaniel would go to protect his mistress.

Time was running out. Without the complete footage, Margaret would be convicted in three days.

Vivian picked up her phone.

Thirty minutes later, Julian Blackthorn stood at her doorstep.

Dressed in all black, the hacker looked like a modern-day vampire - mysterious and dangerously attractive.

"Finally remembered me, Scarlet?" Julian teased with a smirk.

Online forums often paired Phoenix and Haze as the digital Bonnie and Clyde.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Spare me the internet jokes. I never liked that comparison."

"What should I call you then? My femme fatale?"

She threw a playful punch his way. With Julian, she could always be herself - no pretenses, no tension.

Unlike with Nathaniel, where every interaction felt like walking on eggshells.

"Enough banter. I need your help with something urgent."

She led Julian to her workstation. "Think you can crack this hospital's cloud storage?"

If she couldn't breach the system, Julian was her last hope.

He glanced at the screen, that trademark smirk playing on his lips. "Of course I can. But what's in it for me?"
###Chapter 195

Vivian propped her face in her palms, batting her eyelashes dramatically. "You should feel honored to receive this rare token of appreciation from Newport City's most exquisite rose!"

"Try harder."

Julian Blackthorn dismissed her with a wave, sprawling across the leather sofa. His long legs stretched out as he idly bounced one foot. "My standard consulting fee starts at 150 million. You're asking for pro bono work? Not happening."

Vivian's fingers twitched with the urge to smack that infuriating smirk off his face.

But she needed his skills. Forcing a saccharine smile, she asked through gritted teeth, "Fine. Name your price."

Julian suddenly perked up, sitting ramrod straight. "Well, I'll be hitting thirty soon. My grandfather keeps nagging about settling down, so—"

"Hard pass!"

Vivian crossed her arms in an X before he finished. "My heart's locked away in a vault. The only romance in my life is with my career. Friends? Great. Lovers? Not in this lifetime."

Amusement danced in Julian's hazel eyes as his lips curved into that trademark devil-may-care grin. "Relax, Lockhart. You're decent company, but I'd rather swim with sharks than walk down the aisle. Marriage is a scam."

"Ahem. Right."

Heat crept up Vivian's neck.

God, when had she become as arrogant as Nathaniel Blackwood? Assuming every man wanted her? This was beyond embarrassing.

"Then what's your actual demand?" She quickly changed the subject.

"Grandfather's eightieth birthday gala is coming up. He's threatened to disinherit me if I don't bring a date." Julian shrugged. "You're the only woman in my contacts who wouldn't faint at my family's... eccentricities."

"Fake girlfriend gig?" Vivian tapped her chin, then grinned. "Consider it done. I've maintained twelve burner social media accounts without getting doxxed. Acting's my second nature."

"Deal."

Their palms met in a crisp high-five.

Julian swiveled to the holographic keyboard. Within minutes, his fingers flew across the interface, bypassing firewalls like they were child's play. The hospital's encrypted surveillance footage materialized on screen.

Vivian gaped. "That's impossible! You just cracked S-tier military-grade encryption in eight minutes flat!"

"Obviously."

Leaning back, Julian raked a hand through his tousled chestnut hair. Sunlight caught the sharp angles of his face—all smirking lips and dangerous charm.

For a heartbeat, Vivian's pulse stuttered.

Unlike Nathaniel's glacial perfection, Julian was wildfire wrapped in Armani—all easy smiles masking untouchable mystery. The kind of man no woman could ever cage.

Then his next words nearly made her choke.

"Because I designed this encryption. Your ex-husband paid me forty million to upgrade the system last night." Julian's grin turned wolfish. "Hacking my own work? Child's play."

"What?"

Vivian's blood ran cold.

So Nathaniel knew Margaret was innocent. Yet he'd destroyed the evidence instead of freeing her. The depth of his cruelty still shocked her.

Thank God for Julian's intervention. Now she had the unedited footage.

"Will he know you accessed it?" she asked urgently.

Julian winked. "My lips are sealed... for the right price."

"Keep it that way."

She couldn't wait to see Nathaniel and Cassandra's faces when this footage played in court.

"Brilliant, really." Julian stretched like a satisfied cat. "Your ex pays me to lock you out. You sweet-talk your way in. Meanwhile, I collect from both sides. Everyone wins."

That roguish glint in his eyes deepened.

What began as casual amusement now sparked with genuine interest. The game just got far more intriguing.
###Chapter 196

The moment Julian Blackthorn walked out, Isabella Lockhart found herself alone again in the vast Skyview Retreat.

She stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows as she had done countless nights before, staring at the glowing orb in the sky.

Tonight's moon hung full and radiant against the velvet darkness, like a flawless pearl suspended in infinite space.

"Moonlight carries whispers of longing..."

For reasons she couldn't explain, Isabella suddenly remembered the mysterious stranger from that late-night chat.

His profile picture had been a crescent moon.

His only message to her had been a photograph of the moon.

Her fingers moved on their own as she pulled out her phone, enlarging the lunar image he'd sent.

Judging by the angle, the photo must have been taken through an office window.

Probably some overworked executive burning midnight oil for his corporate overlords.

A faint smile touched her lips as she snapped her own moon photo and sent it to him.

Strange. Though their exchanges had been brief - mostly her venting about life's troubles - she sensed his undivided attention with every word she typed.

Even without offering empty platitudes, she felt truly heard.

That rare connection warmed her from within.

Her phone chimed minutes later.

"Trouble sleeping?"

Two simple words that painted a picture of someone calm, steady, reliable.

"Too much on my mind."

"Such as?"

"An infuriating man who keeps messing with my head. My only family framed and imprisoned. Needing to leave but being trapped here. Everything's falling apart."

Her fingers flew across the screen, releasing pent-up frustrations.

Realizing she'd overshared again, she quickly added, "Sorry for dumping this on you. It's just...I haven't had anyone to talk to. Feel free to ignore my rambling."

The response came after a thoughtful pause: "Why leave?"

"Personal reasons."

Pregnant with twins. Showing soon. Needing to escape Newport City before her condition became obvious.

But first, securing her business empire to ensure her children's future remained free from anyone's control.

She offered no further explanation. To her relief, he didn't press.

His eventual reply surprised her: "Sleep now. Tomorrow may bring solutions."

"From your lips to God's ears."

Isabella exhaled, tension leaving her shoulders.

In this ruthless world, what comfort surpassed someone simply telling you to rest?

That stranger's quiet concern became her anchor in the lonely darkness.

Hope flickered to life within her.

Phone set aside, she drifted into rare, peaceful slumber.

Morning found her rising early, freshening up, and grabbing the surveillance footage drive before heading out to meet Alexander Graves regarding tomorrow's trial.

The door swung open - and she collided with Evelyn Whitmore.

"Evelyn? Is that really you?"

Isabella rubbed her eyes, certain sleep still fogged her vision.

"Who else would it be, Miss Isabella?"

Evelyn clasped her hands excitedly. "You're incredible! When you promised to get me out, I never imagined it would happen overnight. Your parents would be so proud!"

"But..."

Confusion knotted Isabella's brow.

She'd been working on Evelyn's release, but hadn't made her move yet!

"Miss Isabella, what did you do? The guards said a terrified Cassandra Delacroix withdrew all charges at dawn! That's why they let me go!"

Evelyn's curious gaze searched her face for answers.
###Chapter 197

"..."

Vivian froze, completely speechless.

Knowing Cassandra Delacroix's true nature, that scheming witch would never drop the charges out of the goodness of her heart.

Which meant Nathaniel must have ordered this. But the cold-hearted bastard was supposed to use Evelyn as leverage against Vivian. Why would he retreat first?

Had he discovered Julian's hack into the hospital's cloud storage last night?

Vivian immediately dialed Julian's number.

He answered groggily, clearly still half-asleep. "Miss me already, Scarlet?"

"Enough jokes. Tell me straight - did anyone discover your hack last night?"

"Why so tense? What's wrong?"

"Just answer the damn question!"

"Relax, nobody knows." Julian's voice dripped with confidence. "My encryption is flawless. Unless I talk, it stays buried."

Vivian fell silent, chewing her lip in thought before responding. "Alright. Got it."

"Wait, what's going on? You-"

She hung up before he could finish.

"So ruthless?" Julian smirked, stretching his sculpted arms above his head. The morning light highlighted every defined muscle. "That wildcat's got claws."

Meanwhile, Vivian paced nervously, analyzing the situation.

If the security footage theft remained undetected, Nathaniel had no reason to release Evelyn. What game was he playing?

"Miss Viv, I told you not to worry. I knew everything would work out..." Evelyn's comforting words suddenly triggered Vivian's memory of last night's mysterious message:

"Perhaps tomorrow your problems will solve themselves."

The timing was too perfect. Could that stranger predict the future? Or... was Nathaniel himself behind that anonymous account?

The moon photo did resemble the view from Nathaniel's office French windows!

Vivian sprinted upstairs and booted her computer, fingers flying across the keyboard to trace the account's IP.

After executing a complex code string, the location locked onto a twenty-something office worker in a neighboring city - completely unrelated to Nathaniel.

Predictable. Logical.

Vivian exhaled in relief, though a strange disappointment lingered.

"Get a grip, Vivian. Who do you think you are? Why would he waste time chatting with you on a burner account?" She laughed bitterly.

Regardless, Nathaniel's sudden "truce" signaled something bigger brewing.

"Evelyn, stay home the next few days. I don't trust Nathaniel's sudden kindness. He's planning something."

"But Miss Viv, Mr. Blackwood isn't as cruel as you think. Maybe he genuinely doesn't want to hurt you. He sees how much I mean to you. A lawsuit would burn all bridges between you two..."

Evelyn pleaded, "Please reconsider dropping charges against Miss Delacroix too. Don't make your relationship irreparable!"

Vivian scoffed. "So this is his psychological play - make me withdraw charges willingly. Too bad he doesn't know who he's dealing with!"

With that, she stormed out, evidence in hand, heading straight for Blackwood Group headquarters.
###Chapter 198

Vivian arrived at Blackwood Group headquarters.

No one stopped her at security. Employees greeted her warmly as she passed through the lobby.

Rachel Miles, Ethan's executive assistant, was the most devoted shipper of their relationship. Her eyes sparkled as she rushed to welcome Vivian.

"Mrs. Blackwood! Mr. Blackwood is currently in a board meeting. Would you prefer to wait in his office, or shall I interrupt the meeting?"

"I'll wait in his office."

"Right this way!"

Rachel nodded eagerly.

Normally, no one entered the CEO's office without explicit authorization.

But rules didn't apply to the boss's wife.

Vivian settled into Ethan's leather chair, swiveling absently. The plush cushion molded to her shape comfortably.

Her gaze landed on a crystal paperweight on the desk. Something about it tugged at her memory.

"Rachel...is this the gift I gave him last Christmas?"

Rachel's face lit up. "You remembered! Mr. Blackwood treasures this. He polishes it himself every morning."

"And this fountain pen. He refuses to use any other, even when the ink cartridge needs replacing."

"This mousepad too! The corner's frayed but he won't let us order a new one."

Vivian's eyebrows shot up. "Seriously? The Ethan Blackwood I know would never use second-rate gifts like these."

Rachel leaned in conspiratorially. "He's changed recently. Insists on drinking that awful Zambawi coffee blend you once bought him as a joke. The entire executive floor has developed caffeine headaches."

Vivian choked on her water.

These delusional shippers. Her relationship with Ethan was more battlefield than romance these days.

After Rachel left, Vivian waited.

Bored, she studied the floor-to-ceiling windows. The angle, the view...it matched perfectly with the mysterious photo she'd received.

She pulled out her phone, comparing the image to the actual window-

"What are you doing?"

Ethan's icy voice made her jump. Her phone clattered to the floor.

She snatched it up. "Waiting for you. Obviously."

"Who authorized you to be in my office?"

His sculpted features darkened as he advanced. "And in my chair? Have you lost your mind?"

Territorial as always. He hated anyone touching his belongings.

"It's just a chair." Vivian gestured around. "I let you keep all these gifts, didn't I?"

"I never wanted them." His tone dripped disdain.

"Great! I'll take them back then. Save them for my next boyfriend."

Ethan's eyes flashed danger. "Try it."

"You don't want them but won't let me reclaim them? Typical tyrant behavior."

Without responding, he hauled her out of the chair. "State your business. Quickly."

Vivian's expression sobered. "Why did you release Evelyn? Did you suddenly grow a conscience?"

Ethan studied her for a long moment before murmuring, "What if I said it was because I couldn't bear to see you upset? Would you believe me?"
###Chapter 199

"Pfft!"

Vivian couldn't contain her sudden burst of laughter.

Had anyone else spoken those words, she wouldn't have found them amusing.

But coming from Nathaniel Blackwood, the human iceberg? It was downright hilarious.

"Hah! Mr. Blackwood, did you get possessed or something?" Vivian wiped tears from her eyes. "Those words actually came out of your mouth? Now that's comedy gold!"

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

His lips pressed into a thin line as he watched Vivian double over with laughter. "Is it truly that amusing?"

"You bet it is." Vivian finally caught her breath, giving him a mocking look. "Desperate measures, huh? Trying every trick to make me drop the charges against Cassandra?"

She shook her head, still chuckling. "After four years of marriage, you still don't know me at all."

"Did you really think sweet words would work on me now? Like they used to?" Vivian's laughter turned bitter.

"Back then, I listened because you were my husband. Because I cared." Her voice hardened. "Now? You're just my ex. Your requests mean nothing to me."

Each word struck Nathaniel like a blade.

The wound wasn't deep, but the hollow ache it left was undeniable.

For the first time, he realized he might have lost something precious.

A self-deprecating smile touched his lips. "Is that really how you see me?"

Vivian shrugged. "Obviously."

"Pathetic." Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "If I wanted Cassandra free, I have countless ways to make it happen."

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I came to you hoping you'd find closure. But clearly—" He straightened his tie. "My patience has limits."

Vivian's eyes narrowed. "I knew it! You've got something up your sleeve." She slammed her palms on his desk. "Man up and say it to my face!"

Nathaniel ignored her outburst. He opened a file with deliberate calm. "Get out."

"Listen well, Nathaniel Blackwood." Vivian leaned in, her voice trembling with rage. "Play dirty and I'll make you regret it."

The office door burst open as security arrived.

Fuming, Vivian stormed out.

The entire trip had been a waste. No answers. Just more frustration.

She pulled out her phone, fingers flying across the screen as she messaged her mysterious confidant.

[SO. DAMN. ANGRY.] A string of fire emojis followed. [My ex is the most infuriating man alive!]

The reply came instantly. [Still letting him get to you? Sounds like unresolved feelings.]

"Bullshit!" Vivian growled as she typed. [I hate him so much I could feed him to sharks!]

[I'll buy the knife if you need one.]

Vivian actually laughed at that. [You're the best, Mr. Moon.]

The moonlit sea in his profile picture calmed her somehow. The imagined sea breeze seemed to cool her temper as she strode from Blackwood Group's towering headquarters.

She never noticed Nathaniel watching from above.

He stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, gaze tracking her tiny figure below.

So small. Yet somehow, she'd become his greatest challenge.

Releasing Margaret had been a genuine gesture. Why couldn't she see that?

His phone vibrated.

Nathaniel answered without looking. "Proceed as planned."
###Chapter 200

The private hangar stood isolated under the inky night sky, miles away from the bustling city center.

A sleek white jet waited silently on the tarmac.

Cassandra Delacroix trembled as she was escorted by a group of intimidating men toward the aircraft.

"Nathaniel, I knew you'd come for me!"

The moment she spotted the imposing figure seated inside, her anxiety melted into relief. She rushed forward, desperate for his embrace.

But Nathaniel Blackwood's expression remained icy—bordering on irritation.

"This jet will take you to Seabreeze City tonight. You'll remain there until the baby is born. No contact with the outside world."

His emotionless tone sent a chill down her spine.

"What are you saying, Nathaniel? You're locking me away? How is this any better than prison?"

His sculpted features didn't flicker. "You're welcome to return and face trial if you prefer."

"No!"

Cassandra's composure shattered. Tears spilled down her cheeks as she transformed into a picture of vulnerability. "Nathaniel, why are you treating me like this? What did I do wrong?"

"You know I'm innocent! Shouldn't you be defending me? Instead, you're hiding me like some dirty secret! How is this fair?"

"Fair?"

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "You dare speak of fairness when it comes to Isabella Lockhart? That's the greatest injustice of all."

The venom in his words stunned her. She swallowed hard. "I... I don't understand."

She could feel it—the man before her wasn't the same one she could manipulate so easily anymore.

"You're carrying my brother's child. His only heir. For the sake of his bloodline, Isabella had no choice but to—"

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "Yet you used this to steal everything that rightfully belonged to her. And you call that fair?"

Cassandra's mouth went dry.

"If you'd stayed in your lane, I might have let you keep what you schemed for. But you got greedy. Vicious. I won't tolerate it any longer."

Disgust laced Nathaniel's words.

How could his honorable brother have fallen for a woman like this? Even in his final moments, Sebastian's last wish was for Nathaniel to protect Cassandra and their unborn child...

"Enough. Just go."

Nathaniel stood to leave.

Cassandra lunged forward, blocking his path with desperate sobs. "You've got it all wrong! I'm not greedy! I just want to give Sebastian's baby a safe birth and a real family! You were the one who suggested divorcing Isabella to marry me! But now you're blaming me?"

Her words gave Nathaniel pause.

If Cassandra and this child had never existed... would he still have divorced Isabella?

Probably. Their marriage had always been contractual. Loveless. The end was inevitable.

"Nathaniel, I messed up. I swear I'll behave. I'll stay away from Isabella. Just let me be with you—let us raise Sebastian's child together. Please."

She clutched his arm, her voice breaking.

"The baby comes in months. Do you really want them born in hiding? To grow up fatherless, without legal rights?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

His gaze dropped to her barely visible bump. Finally, he relented. "We'll discuss this after the birth."

"Thank you! I trust you, Nathaniel. I'll do whatever you say!"

Cassandra knew when to push and when to yield. She sniffled dramatically. "We'll wait for you. The baby and I... we'll always wait."

The jet's engines roared to life.

Inside his limousine, Nathaniel watched the aircraft shrink into the night, his expression unreadable.

Brother... you wouldn't blame me for this, would you?

The next morning, before the trial could begin, Isabella Lockhart received shocking news—

Cassandra Delacroix had allegedly taken her own life.
###Chapter 201

"She's dead? Suicide?"

Vivian Lockhart's phone nearly slipped from her fingers as the call came through on their way to the courthouse.

Nathaniel Blackwood turned sharply in the passenger seat. "What happened?"

"The court just informed me Cassandra Delacroix took her own life this morning. Her body's already at the crematorium."

"Impossible."

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension like steel. "Cassandra was a prime suspect in an ongoing trial. Even with a suicide, legal protocol requires a mandatory investigation period before any disposition of remains. This reeks of foul play."

"Unless someone's covering their tracks," Vivian breathed, nails digging into her palms. "Or swapping the corpse entirely."

"Exactly."

As a seasoned attorney, Nathaniel had seen every trick in the book. Suspects "committing suicide" conveniently before trial? Oldest trick in the mafia playbook.

Vivian's laugh held no humor. "Now I understand why you let Evelyn Whitmore walk free yesterday. This was always your endgame."

"Pathetic, isn't it?" Nathaniel's lip curled. "Rather than fight fair in court, he'd rather play god with the justice system. How far the mighty have fallen."

For the first time, Vivian felt genuine disgust toward the man she'd once loved. Faking a death to protect his mistress? Cassandra Delacroix had reduced him to this? The shame burned hotter than her anger.

"Don't blame yourself, boss." Julian Montgomery adjusted his tie in the rearview mirror. "The Blackwood name carries weight. Judges, cops—they all jump when he snaps his fingers. But if you want to keep pursuing this, victory is still within reach. Your call."

Vivian exhaled sharply. "Drop it."

This had never been about putting Cassandra behind bars. She'd wanted the woman broken, humiliated. Now? Forced to live as a ghost under a new identity? That was punishment enough.

So long as Cassandra stayed in the shadows, Vivian would let sleeping dogs lie.

Mothers understood sacrifices. However vile the parent, the child deserved peace.

Julian whistled. "Mother Teresa reborn. With a boss this merciful, retirement's looking sweet."

The bootlicking almost made her smile. Funny how the attorney who'd once despised her now worshipped the ground she walked on.

"Dream on." Vivian flicked his ear. "You haven't earned a coffee break, let alone retirement. I'm no Blackwood Group charity—I'm Vivian Lockhart. And I'll wring every drop of talent from your overpriced suit."

Julian's chuckle was rueful. "Noticed that, did you? You're worse than Nathaniel. At least he paid us to jump. You? We'd dive off cliffs unpaid. That's power."

She pretended to gag. His flattery needed work.

"Enough. That matter we discussed—can your team handle it?"

Julian sobered instantly. "Taking on a multinational like that? It's David versus Goliath."

"Which is why I demanded Blackwood Legal in the divorce." Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Or more accurately, its three star attorneys."

"Two of us are game. But Victoria Chen?" Julian hesitated. "I crush criminal cases, Gregory dominates administrative law. Commercial litigation? Victoria's the queen. And you haven't even met her."

Vivian shrugged. "Female solidarity."

"Don't count on it." Julian lowered his voice. "Rumor is, she and Nathaniel are... close. She's settled countless disputes for Blackwood Group. Now that the firm's yours? She might defect to them. Then where would that leave you?"

"Nowhere."

The certainty in her voice made Julian blink.

"Actually..." He checked his phone. "Victoria texted me last night. She's flying in from Stanford today. Want to charm her over lunch?"

Vivian's eyes gleamed. "Perfect."
###Chapter 202

The moment Vivian Lockhart heard Victoria Chen would return to Newport City by 8 PM, her pulse quickened.

She'd been anticipating this meeting for months.

As Julian Montgomery had explained, when it came to corporate litigation on an international scale, Victoria ranked among the top five attorneys worldwide - possibly even top three.

Vivian desperately needed Victoria's expertise for her management rights lawsuit.

Winning this case would secure financial freedom for Vivian and her children forever.

That's why she'd settled for just a small law firm during her divorce from Nathaniel.

Julian mentioned Victoria had spent the last six months in Berlin handling a complex inheritance dispute.

Fatefully, that case bore striking similarities to Vivian's current legal battle.

With Victoria's triumphant return, Vivian could almost taste victory herself.

Assuming, of course, Victoria would agree to help like Julian had.

"Julian, I'm meeting Ms. Chen tonight. What flowers does she prefer? I want to bring her a welcoming gift."

Excitement erased all traces of Briar Desrosiers' earlier unpleasantness from Vivian's expression.

"If I recall correctly, she favors carnations. Purple ones especially."

Julian sighed, making one last attempt to temper expectations. "Boss, Victoria's notoriously difficult. You won me over with gaming sessions, but she's different. She's probably returning just to terminate her contract with Blackwood Legal. You're walking into rejection."

"Even if she takes your case, our odds remain slim."

Julian wasn't trying to dampen Vivian's spirits, but her goals bordered on impossible.

"I have to try. Remember my Electronic Technology Association campaign? No one believed in me then either, but..."

Vivian's voice swelled with pride at the memory, strengthening her resolve.

She never abandoned her decisions lightly.

"True enough!"

Julian's admiration shone through as he nodded. "Our boss defies expectations. Go for it!"

By 6 PM, Vivian waited at the airport arrivals gate.

Clutching a lavish bouquet of purple carnations, she stood conspicuously near the VIP exit holding a "Victoria Chen" sign - the picture of an eager fan awaiting her idol.

Two hours later, Victoria's flight finally landed.

A petite woman emerged from the VIP lane - khaki silk blouse, white tailored slacks, black sunglasses - radiating confidence with every step.

Vivian instantly recognized the legendary attorney.

"Ms. Chen! Over here!"

She waved the bouquet enthusiastically, ignoring curious glances from passersby.

The sunglasses turned toward Vivian, emitting a frosty aura that felt eerily familiar.

It mirrored Nathaniel Blackwood's signature chill.

Were all extraordinary people carved from ice?

That only made Vivian more determined to melt through.

"At last we meet, Ms. Chen! I've waited so long for this moment. These are for you!"

Vivian thrust the flowers forward eagerly.

"Vivian Lockhart?"

The woman stopped coldly.

"Yes. Your new employer."

Victoria slid her sunglasses down slightly, appraising Vivian with disdain. "I despise carnations."
###Chapter 203

"You don't like them?"

Vivian's hand froze mid-air. A flicker of embarrassment crossed her face. "Julian said purple carnations were your favorite. Seems that man doesn't know you at all. I'll make sure he regrets it later."

"Then what flowers do you prefer? I'll get you a fresh bouquet right away—"

Victoria pushed her sunglasses up, tilting her chin with icy disdain. "No, he was right. I used to adore purple carnations. But the moment I saw you holding them, I started despising them."

"..."

The words were a slap to Vivian's face.

Mortification burned through her, her toes curling so hard they could've dug trenches in the floor.

If anyone else had spoken to her like that, Vivian would've retaliated without hesitation.

But this was Victoria Chen—the undisputed queen of the legal world. Cold, arrogant, utterly untouchable. And Vivian? She was utterly smitten.

"It's fine if you hate me, but the flowers are innocent. Don't take it out on them. These poor carnations might start crying if you reject them..."

With shameless persistence, Vivian thrust the massive bouquet toward Victoria again.

Behind those dark lenses, Victoria's eyes flickered with something unreadable.

After a long pause, her lips curled in contempt. "I can't believe Nathaniel Blackwood's ex-wife is this shameless. Do you not understand rejection? Or are you just blind to how much I despise you?"

"Let me make this clear. I don't like flowers. And I certainly don't like you. What you're doing borders on harassment. Keep it up, and I will take legal action."

With that, Victoria strode past her, head held high like royalty dismissing a peasant.

Watching her walk away, Vivian didn't feel anger—just helpless amusement. The look on her face could only be described as... adoring.

"What about Isabella?"

Vivian's voice rang out suddenly.

Victoria's tall frame stiffened. Slowly, she turned. "What did you say?"

"Do you hate Isabella too?"

Victoria ripped off her sunglasses, eyes blazing. "You investigated me?"

"Obviously." Vivian shrugged. "You're my lawyer. Of course I did my homework."

"I'm not your lawyer. I came to terminate my contract. As of today, I have no ties to Blackwood Legal—and I will not be working for you."

Her tone left no room for argument.

She'd only joined Blackwood Legal for Nathaniel. A firm like that was beneath someone of her caliber. Now that ownership had changed hands, she had zero reason to stay.

The termination fee was astronomical, but to her? Pocket change.

Vivian nodded calmly. "Ambition is admirable. I respect your choice. But before you go, as your current employer, there's something I want to give you."

She pulled out her phone, tapped the screen, and handed it to Victoria.

"What is this—?"

The moment Victoria saw the video, her frosty gaze faltered.

—

Vivian spoke softly. "This was filmed on your daughter's sixth birthday. It's been years since you've seen her, hasn't it? I heard she's brilliant—piano, chess, calligraphy, painting... She even inherited your legal genius. By ten, she'd devoured every law book in her school's library. They call her the 'mini attorney.' She—"

"Enough."

Victoria looked away, her expression hardening back to ice. "I gave her up. She's not my concern anymore. Whatever talents she has mean nothing to me."

Her voice was steel. "But I am impressed you dug up my past. Expect a lawsuit for this invasion of privacy."

Vivian ignored the threat.

As an expectant mother herself, she knew one truth above all: no mother stops loving her child.

The colder Victoria acted, the more it proved how much that little girl still haunted her.

A slow smile curved Vivian's lips.

Got you.

She stepped closer. "Aren't you curious, Miss Chen? About Isabella's birthday wish?"
###Chapter 204

Victoria Chen's face flickered with emotion before settling back into icy detachment.

"Birthday wishes from a stranger mean nothing to me."

Her voice was sharp as shattered glass. "Don't flatter yourself thinking these cheap tactics will make me cooperate."

Vivian Lockhart's lips curved knowingly. "Oh, I wouldn't dream of it."

She tilted her head, sunlight catching the amusement in her eyes. "Let's just say I've gained... unique insight into maternal psychology recently."

A beat of silence.

"Not curious about Isabella now? That's fine." Vivian shrugged. "My door's always open when you change your mind."

She flashed a grin that made Victoria's fingers twitch. "Isabella and I? Basically attached at the hip these days."

"Attached at the hip?"

Something dark flashed behind Victoria's pupils—there and gone like a dying ember.

"How juvenile," she scoffed, turning away.

Vivian didn't rise to the bait. She understood that reaction better than Victoria realized.

Her private investigators had unearthed secrets even Ethan Blackwood didn't know.

Six years ago, Victoria Chen was a struggling attorney surviving on instant noodles. Then came the pregnancy—no father listed on any record.

For twelve months, she'd been both parents to that baby girl. Until the day she walked into an ivy-covered house near Stanford University and never looked back.

The couple who took the child? None other than Vivian's former thesis advisor Anthony Wood and his wife Sophia.

Now Victoria stood polished and untouchable as Blackwood Legal's star litigator—with rumors swirling about her and Nathaniel Blackwood. Some claimed he'd built the entire firm just for her.

If true, it explained why Victoria would rather die than acknowledge her daughter's existence now.

Vivian hoped she was wrong. That this brilliant woman hadn't sacrificed motherhood for a man like Nathaniel.

But if she had?

She deserved to know the truth.

Next morning. Stanford University's faculty housing.

The air smelled like blooming jasmine as petals rained down in slow spirals. This tree-lined lane had become Instagram famous—today, half the photography club was discreetly snapping shots of the woman in lemon-yellow.

Vivian's sundress fluttered as she knocked on a familiar oak door.

"Early as always!" Sophia Wood beamed, ushering her inside. "Anthony's out buying your favorite seafood. That man spoils you worse than his grad students."

Vivian laughed, kicking off her sandals. "You should stop me from freeloading. I'd eat cardboard if it meant more of your peach cobbler."

"Nonsense." Sophia's eyes crinkled. "You're practically family. Besides—"

A delighted whisper. "Isabella woke up at dawn insisting she help pick desserts for 'Auntie Viv.' That child adores you."

Vivian's chest warmed. Fate had a wicked sense of humor—the daughter Victoria abandoned now clung to Vivian's hand during campus walks, calling her "best friend."

"Oh!" Sophia added, stirring a pot of soup. "Anthony mentioned another guest joining us today. Someone special."

Vivian paused. "Who—"

The front door burst open.

Anthony strode in laden with grocery bags, a giggling Isabella dangling from his arm. And behind them—

Vivian's breath caught.

The last person she expected to see.
###Chapter 205

"Ethan Blackwood!" Vivian gasped in shock.

Her eyes nearly popped out when she spotted the towering figure standing behind Professor Kingsley and Isabella.

Ethan Blackwood was all business, through and through. What could he possibly have to discuss with Professor Kingsley, a renowned scholar?

Was he here for Isabella too?

"Big Sis Vivian! You're here! Isabella missed you so much!"

Isabella, dressed in a sunny yellow dress with her hair in twin braids, flitted over like a butterfly. Her porcelain face beamed up at Vivian with pure adoration.

"I missed you too, sweetheart. It's only been a few days, but you've gotten even prettier. Come here—let me kiss those cheeks!"

Vivian cupped Isabella's face and planted several loud kisses on her.

The heartwarming scene made Leonard and his wife exchange pleased smiles.

"They're so close. It's like they were sisters in another life," Sophia mused.

Leonard turned to Ethan. "Sophia and I never had children of our own. Before Isabella, we treated Vivian like our daughter. They haven't known each other long, but they're inseparable. Like real sisters!"

Ethan's gaze flicked to Vivian. As usual, his voice was flat. "Sisters? The age gap is too wide."

Vivian: "..."

Her fists clenched. She wanted to punch him!

Was he implying she was old?

But he was older than her! If she was old, then so was he!

Just as she was about to retaliate, Isabella chirped, "Uncle Ethan, this is Big Sis Vivian I told you about. Isn't she beautiful?"

Ethan's expression darkened. He didn't respond, clearly displeased.

Leonard quickly interjected, "No, no, you can't call him uncle if you call Vivian big sis. Isabella, remember—if you call her big sis, you should call him big brother."

"Why?"

"Because Big Sis Vivian and Uncle Ethan used to be..."

Professor Kingsley hesitated, unsure how to explain that Vivian and Ethan had once been married.

Sophia smoothly added, "They were like mommy and daddy, so they belong to the same generation. Understand?"

Isabella blinked. She looked between Vivian and Ethan, then frowned. "But Big Sis Vivian looks so much nicer than Uncle Ethan. Uncle Ethan is scary... I've never seen a big brother this scary!"

"Pfft—HAHAHA!"

Vivian burst out laughing.

"You hear that, Ethan Blackwood? Kids don't lie. She's saying you look ancient. You're pushing thirty—maybe start a skincare routine before you join Professor Kingsley's age bracket. Aren't you worried?"

Ethan stared at her like she was an idiot, then turned to Leonard. "Professor, let's talk in the study."

Leonard nodded solemnly. "Right. This way."

As the two men disappeared into the study, Vivian was still wheezing with laughter.

When she finally caught her breath, realization struck.

What was Ethan doing here? What did he need to discuss with Professor Kingsley?

"Sophia, do you know why Ethan came to see the professor?"

Sophia shook her head. "No idea. Ask Leonard yourself later."

After playing with Isabella for a while, Vivian crept toward the study, pressing her ear to the door.

Just as she leaned in, the door swung open.

She lost her balance and tumbled straight into a solid chest.

Ethan's embrace was unexpectedly secure.

"Eavesdropping is rude," he said coldly, looking down at her.

Vivian scrambled upright, cheeks burning. "Right, eavesdropping is rude—so I won't eavesdrop. I'll just sit in and listen. May I?"

Ethan gave her that same idiot-stare. "What do you think?"

Vivian glared. "I wasn't asking you. I was asking Professor Kingsley!"

She turned to Leonard with her most charming smile. "Professor, can I join you? I promise I'll be quiet."

Leonard had always doted on her. Surely he'd say yes... right?
###Chapter 206

Professor Kingsley didn't comply with Vivian's request this time.

He said firmly, "This matter remains confidential between us. But we're done discussing now. I'll prepare dinner while you two take Isabella for a walk."

Vivian blinked. "But—"

She wanted to protest that it wasn't appropriate.

Nathaniel was quicker. His expression remained impassive as he stated, "I've heard Stanford University has a renowned pathway called Magnolia Lane. A walk sounds acceptable."

"Exactly!" Professor Kingsley's eyes twinkled as he glanced between them. "Magnolia Lane is our campus landmark. The blossoms are currently in full bloom—white petals drifting like snowfall when the wind blows."

He leaned closer conspiratorially. "There's even a legend... Couples who walk hand-in-hand down this lane are destined to grow old together. My wife Sophia and I, along with other faculty couples living nearby, prove its magic."

Vivian feigned horror. "That's terrifying! Imagine being stuck forever with someone you despise."

She deliberately wrinkled her nose at Nathaniel while exiting.

His jaw tightened.

That woman had clearly aimed those words at him. The audacity!

Professor Kingsley chuckled. "See? I warned you. Vivian's true mischievous nature emerges when she's free. Marriage suppressed her spirit."

Nathaniel remained silent.

"A little" was a gross understatement. Post-divorce, she'd become an entirely different person.

Sometimes he wondered if she had multiple personalities.

"Come, Isabella! Adventure awaits!"

The two women departed like carefree sisters.

Stanford University remained as Vivian remembered—a perfect blend of academic rigor and artistic charm.

During her student days, she'd been legendary—both for her striking beauty and prodigious intellect.

Yet at her zenith, she'd shocked everyone by marrying into wealth, abandoning her physics career. A tragic waste of brilliance...

Magnolia petals dusted Vivian's hair like nature's confetti.

She caught one, inhaling its fragrance as sunlight illuminated her porcelain features. The scene belonged in a romance film.

"It's snowing!" Isabella twirled beneath the floral shower, spotting Nathaniel's approach. "Uncle Nathaniel! Join us!"

She dragged the reluctant man toward Vivian.

"Why are you following us?" Vivian's cheeks pinkened.

Had he witnessed her cinematic moment? Mortifying.

Nathaniel's sculpted features betrayed no emotion. "Public pathways aren't your personal property."

Vivian huffed.

Infuriating man!

Chin lifted, she declared, "Actually, this lane was created for me."

His eyebrow arched skeptically.

"Don't believe me?"

She flagged down a passing student. "Excuse me! Could you share Magnolia Lane's history?"

"Absolutely!" The eager student launched into an animated explanation.

"Years ago, this very path..."
###Chapter 207

"Years ago, this pathway was constructed by the Stanford Scholarship Foundation to commemorate the iconic figure of Stanford University and the beloved goddess in the hearts of countless students—Vivian Lockhart."

The college student's voice grew more animated as he spoke, painting Vivian as a near-mythical figure.

"You probably don't realize just how extraordinary Vivian Lockhart was. The research team she led dominated international physics competitions. Some of her published academic papers even became required reading in foreign university curricula!"

"Ahem!"

Vivian hadn't expected her legacy at Stanford to remain so strong after all these years. The student's effusive praise was making her cheeks warm. She quickly cut him off. "Alright, alright, we get it—she was amazing!"

"And she was! But she had terrible taste in men."

The student sighed dramatically, shaking his head. "At the peak of her career, she walked away—just to get married. And not just to anyone, but to Ethan Blackwood, a man everyone could tell was trouble from the start. My friends and I knew that marriage wouldn’t last."

"Sure enough… he cheated. Rumor has it they’re divorced now. I just hope Vivian Lockhart leaves that heartbreak behind and reclaims her brilliance!"

Ethan’s expression darkened dangerously.

Vivian quickly ushered the student away before Ethan could retaliate. The last thing she needed was him blacklisting some innocent kid.

"See? I wasn’t lying. This path was made for me. If I say you can’t walk here, then you can’t."

She tilted her chin up, smirking at Ethan.

He studied her, surprised. The woman he’d always dismissed as naive had once been a physics prodigy?

Hearing about her past achievements, even he felt a pang of regret—marrying him had been a waste of her talent.

"True, the Sophora Pathway was built in your honor by the Stanford Scholarship Foundation. But do you know who funds it?"

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips.

Vivian frowned, trying to recall. "I met the sponsor a few times after winning awards, but they always remained anonymous. Don’t tell me… you’re the sponsor?"

His smirk deepened. "Surprised?"

As one of the Elite Eight families of Newport City, the Blackwoods had both the influence and wealth to fund Stanford’s most prestigious scholarships.

Vivian rolled her eyes, done with the conversation. "Boring." She turned to leave with Isabella.

Isabella, sweet and perceptive, glanced between them. With one small hand clutching Vivian’s and the other reaching for Ethan, she chirped, "Daddy says people who walk the Sophora Pathway together stay together forever! That means all three of us will!"

Vivian hesitated, but the hopeful spark in Isabella’s eyes made refusal impossible.

To her surprise, Ethan didn’t protest either. His large hand enveloped Isabella’s tiny one, his grip firm.

So they walked—Vivian on one side, Ethan on the other, Isabella swinging between them. From a distance, they looked like the perfect family: the striking CEO, the elegant genius, and the radiant child.

"Excuse me!"

A voice interrupted the moment.
###Chapter 208

A man with a bulky DSLR camera dangling from his neck approached them with an eager smile. "Excuse me," he began politely. "I'm Julian Carter, a freelance photographer. I've been working on a personal project about modern families. The way your family was walking together just now—it was so touching I couldn't resist capturing the moment. Would you mind if I shared these photos online?"

"Absolutely not."

Nathaniel Blackwood's voice was sharp, his glare cutting through the air like ice.

The photographer flinched, swallowing hard. "My apologies. I'll delete them right away." He fumbled with his camera, his expression pained as he prepared to erase what he considered his best shots of the week.

What a shame. The composition was flawless—the golden sunlight, the effortless elegance of the subjects, the genuine warmth between them. Every frame was magazine-worthy. A single post could have skyrocketed his Instagram following.

But now, he had to wipe them all. It hurt more than throwing away a winning lottery ticket.

Nathaniel's cold voice interrupted his thoughts. "Before you delete them, send me the files first."

"Wait—what?"

The photographer hesitated, his pride stung. This felt like handing over his hard work for free.

Nathaniel, ever perceptive, didn’t miss a beat. "Name your price."

The man's eyes lit up instantly. "Right away, sir! Just enable Bluetooth, and I'll transfer them now."

As the two men focused on the transaction, Vivian Lockhart stood forgotten between them. Her irritation grew with every passing second.

First, this stranger had taken photos without consent. Now, Nathaniel was claiming them without even consulting her. She was right there.

"I don’t think so."

Vivian snatched Nathaniel’s phone before he could react. Her cheeks flushed with anger. "I didn’t agree to any of this. Delete them. All of them."

"Give that back."

Nathaniel reached for the phone, his expression darkening.

What followed was an undignified tug-of-war in the middle of the sidewalk, drawing amused glances from passersby. The photographer wisely decided to retreat, clutching his camera like a lifeline.

Vivian swiped through Nathaniel’s gallery, intending to wipe the unauthorized photos—until she froze.

There, among the files, was another picture of her.

It was a candid shot—her laughing under a shower of cherry blossom petals, looking straight out of a romance drama. The lighting, the angle—it was stunning. She barely recognized herself.

But the realization that Nathaniel had secretly taken it sent a strange flutter through her chest.

"Since when do you sneak photos of me?" She narrowed her eyes, scrolling further. "Let’s see what else you’ve been hiding."

To her surprise, his gallery was bizarrely sparse—no other people, just endless shots of houseplants.

Her houseplants.

Then she stumbled upon something that made her breath catch.

"No way." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "How do you even have this?"
###Chapter 209

The photo showed a full moon suspended in the inky black sky, glowing like polished jade.

It was identical to the one sent by the stranger that night.

So Nathaniel Blackwood was "Mr. Moon"?

Vivian Lockhart froze.

Why would the heir of the prestigious Blackwood family, CEO of a global empire, use a burner account to send his ex-wife a moon photo at midnight?

Before she could process it, Nathaniel snatched his phone back, locking it instantly. His icy gaze burned into her, voice sharp. "Stay out of things that don't concern you."

Her thoughts spiraled.

First, she caught him secretly photographing her. Now this? A fake account to message her? It wasn't just strange—it was unsettling.

"You... you're really Mr. Moon?"

She needed confirmation, unable to reconcile the man before her with the anonymous confidant.

His expression remained unreadable. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Don't lie! That photo in your gallery matches the one he sent me exactly!"

"Moons look the same everywhere."

His calm deflection infuriated her.

"Fine. Deny it?"

She pulled out her phone, opened WeChat, and video-called "Mr. Moon."

Nathaniel's phone rang instantly.

"Explain this." She smirked, victorious.

He didn't flinch. "So what if it was me? Oliver taught me pickup techniques. You were an easy target—pouring your heart out to a stranger."

Her stomach dropped.

Memories flooded back—late-night confessions, the comfort she'd found in those messages. Humiliation burned through her.

"You're insane, Nathaniel Blackwood!"

Fury and shame propelled her away, Isabella Thornton trailing behind.

—

Nathaniel watched Vivian disappear, rooted in place.

Maybe he was insane.

Even he couldn't explain why he'd done it.

—

Back at Professor Wood's, the table was set for dinner.

"Just you two?" The professor frowned. "Where's Mr. Blackwood?"

"He's dead," Vivian snapped.

She opened WeChat to delete "Mr. Moon," but her finger hovered.

Scrolling through their chats, his seemingly indifferent replies now revealed hidden concern. The realization twisted her insides.

Professor Wood sighed. "Two strong personalities always clash. Love isn't smooth sailing."

"There is no love. We're divorced."

He chuckled knowingly. "Feelings don't vanish with paperwork. Curious why he sought me out? I'll tell you now..."
###Chapter 210

Vivian's curiosity sparked instantly. She propped her chin on her hand, leaning forward like an eager student awaiting Professor Wood's revelation.

The professor adjusted his glasses with deliberate slowness. "Mr. Blackwood visited today to discuss acquiring fifty percent of Stanford University's management rights—"

"What?" Vivian nearly choked on her drink. "He wants to buy Stanford?"

Her hands trembled with indignation. "Stanford ranks among the nation's top public institutions! Its engineering programs are globally renowned. How dare Nathaniel target a public university?"

Professor Wood waved a dismissive hand. "Now, now, it's not like that. He's proposing a partnership to secure Stanford's future. You know how public funding has dwindled for research projects—"

"If Blackwood Group takes partial control, Stanford becomes semi-private. We'd maintain academic integrity while gaining unlimited research funding. It's an ideal solution."

The logic sounded flawless. Any faculty member would find the offer tempting.

But Vivian knew Nathaniel too well.

The man bled profit margins and calculated ROI before breakfast.

No way would he pour millions into academia without expecting something monumental in return.

"Professor, this can't be as simple as it seems. Nathaniel Blackwood doesn't do charity. What's the catch?"

Wood hesitated. "There are conditions, yes. But reasonable ones, I assure you."

Vivian's nails dug into her palms. "Spell them out."

"Full funding for facilities, experiments, and faculty incentives. In exchange..." The professor cleared his throat. "All future research discoveries would be shared with Blackwood Group. Physics and electronics patents would become their exclusive property."

"Over my dead body!"

Vivian shot up, knocking over her chair. "Stanford's physics department produces groundbreaking work! He thinks he can buy decades of research for pocket change?"

Professor Wood remained calm. "If you object, Ms. Lockhart, you're welcome to make a competing offer. Assuming you have the capital."

Her retort died on her lips.

Her startup barely kept afloat. Challenging a corporate titan like Nathaniel? Impossible.

For now.

Five years from now? She'd bury Blackwood Group in dust.

"Vivian, I understand your pride. We academics cherish our independence. But modern research requires astronomical funding." Wood's face darkened. "Stanford's rankings have slipped. Without drastic change, we'll become irrelevant."

The harsh truth silenced her.

This wasn't just about Nathaniel's greed. Public universities nationwide struggled as private institutions surged ahead with billionaire backing.

Sophia emerged from the kitchen balancing steaming dishes. "Enough shop talk! Dinner's getting cold—"

The front door swung open.

Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his tailored suit absorbing the hallway light.

"Mr. Blackwood! Perfect timing." Sophia beamed. "We were just about to eat."

Vivian's smile turned glacial. Why couldn't this man stay gone?
###Chapter 211

"Apologies for the delay." Ethan flashed a casual smile as he settled beside Vivian, acting as if their earlier argument had never happened.

Vivian shot him a glare but held her tongue. They were guests here, after all. With an exasperated sigh, she turned her attention to her plate.

The dinner table hummed with warmth and laughter.

Little Isabella gnawed on a chicken leg, her tiny hands and cheeks smeared with sauce. The sight melted Vivian's irritation instantly. She reached for a napkin—

But Ethan was faster. Gently, he wiped the girl's face, murmuring, "Such a messy eater." His tone was softer than Vivian had ever heard.

She stared, caught off guard. This wasn't the cold, detached Ethan Blackwood she knew. The man dabbing sauce from a child's chin seemed almost... human.

Her anger dissolved like sugar in tea.

Isabella beamed up at him. "Uncle Ethan, you're prettier than movie stars! I should call you Brother Ethan so you match Sister Vivian better!"

Anthony and his wife burst into laughter. "Smart girl!"

"Mr. Blackwood," Anthony said, swirling his wine. "You seem fond of children. Sons or daughters—which would you prefer?"

To everyone's surprise, Ethan answered without his usual icy demeanor. "Daughters. They're sweeter. I'd spoil one rotten." A faint smirk tugged his lips. "But sons have uses too—hiking, skiing, business... and when they misbehave, I can knock some sense into them."

Eleanor grinned. "Then you'll need two! Pregnancy takes years—best start soon."

Anthony winked. "Or aim for twins. One of each, done in one go."

Eleanor rolled her eyes. "Twins aren't ordered, darling. It's genetics." She turned to Ethan. "Any twins in your family?"

Ethan shook his head.

"Ah!" Anthony's face lit up. "But Vivian's side has the gene! Her twin brother was stillborn—umbilical cord accident. Tragic, really."

Ethan's gaze snapped to Vivian. "You had a twin?"

"Yes." Her voice tightened. "It's not something we discuss." The loss had shattered her parents. They'd erased all traces of that baby boy, as if he'd never existed. Only Eleanor, a former biology professor, knew the details—for academic purposes.

Eleanor leaned in eagerly. "Statistically, Vivian's very likely to have boy-girl twins. Mr. Blackwood, if you want both, she's your best shot."

Vivian choked on her wine.

Ethan, however, remained unflustered. "Noted."

Noted?! Vivian seethed silently. Who crowned you king of my uterus?

Anthony's eyes dropped to her midsection. "Viv, your stomach looks... rounder. Are you already carrying twins?"
###Chapter 212

"Pfft!" Vivian sprayed the soup across the table, her cheeks flaming. "Professor Kingsley, what kind of nonsense is that? Getting pregnant isn't that simple! People will misunderstand!"

Eleanor tilted her head, studying Vivian's midsection with a frown. "I see his point. Your stomach does look rounder lately..."

"Mrs. Kingsley, don't encourage him!" Vivian groaned before forcing a calm tone. "I've just been indulging since the divorce. No more strict diets like when I was married. Back then, I barely ate—that's why I was so thin!"

Leonard and Eleanor exchanged glances, nodding. "True," Eleanor conceded. "Women gain weight easily if they're not careful."

But Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on Vivian. He'd caught the split-second panic she'd tried to mask. Over-explaining often meant hiding something. Was there really something unusual about her stomach?

He didn't press further. Instead, he handed her a napkin. "Clean yourself up."

After dinner, Nathaniel prepared to leave, but Isabella clung to him. "Brother Nathaniel, Sister Vivian, take me out! Mom and Dad are always tired, and I'm bored staying home!"

The elderly couple sighed. "She's right. We're too old for outings, and she spends too much time alone with books. Other children have young parents to show them the world..."

Trapped, Nathaniel and Vivian agreed.

They drove to a nearby mall. The moment they entered, Isabella dashed toward the arcade. "I want to shoot zombies!" she cried, zeroing in on a horror-themed game.

Nathaniel followed, but Vivian hesitated at the entrance. The arcade was crowded and loud—hardly safe for pregnancy.

"Why aren't you coming?" Nathaniel turned, arching a brow.

"I... didn't sleep well last night," Vivian lied. "It's too stuffy in there. I'll get dizzy."

Nathaniel held her gaze a beat too long before joining Isabella.

Soon, laughter echoed—or rather, Isabella's laughter. "Sister Vivian, Brother Nathaniel is amazing! He won so many tickets I got all these prizes!" She shoved a plush panda into Vivian's hands. "Mama Panda for you, Papa Panda for him, and..." She paused, pointing at Vivian's stomach. "Baby Panda stays with me until your baby arrives!"

Vivian stiffened. "Sweetheart, I'm not pregnant."

"You will be!" Isabella chirped.

Vivian shot Nathaniel a frantic look, relieved when he seemed distracted.

As they walked away, none noticed the shadow trailing them.
###Chapter 213

"Brother Nathaniel, Sister Isabella, it's been ages since I last went to the movies. Let's go watch one!" Isabella Thornton bounced excitedly between them, tugging at their hands as she led them toward the theater.

Vivian Lockhart glanced sideways at Nathaniel Blackwood. Given his status as CEO of Blackwood Group, she assumed he'd find something as mundane as a movie tedious. Surely he'd decline.

To her surprise, he simply shrugged. "Haven't been to the cinema in years. That new animated film, Eternal Soul, looks decent."

"You know about Eternal Soul?" Vivian's eyes lit up instantly. "I've been dying to see it! The reviews are amazing, but it's not getting enough screenings. If we don't catch it now, it'll be gone."

Nathaniel nodded. "True. It's about redemption and second chances. The same studio did Grandma's Melody. That one was solid too."

"Oh my god, yes! I bawled my eyes out watching that in theaters—"

Before they realized it, they were deep in conversation, trading opinions like old friends. They discovered an uncanny overlap in their taste—same favorite films, same critiques, even the same obscure indie picks. It was unsettling how perfectly their preferences aligned.

Vivian smirked. "Nathaniel Blackwood, I always pegged you as a soulless corporate shark. Who knew you had actual taste?"

He arched a brow. "Likewise. I assumed you were just another airheaded socialite."

The screening was about to start. Tickets in hand, they joined the queue. The line snaked through the lobby, Nathaniel standing protectively behind Vivian. Both were unusually eager, the shared anticipation humming between them.

Then Vivian stiffened.

"Wait." She frowned. "Do you feel like we're missing something?"

Nathaniel tilted his head. "Like what?"

Her eyes widened. "Isabella! She's gone!"

They spun around, scanning the crowd. Panic spiked through Vivian's veins. Isabella was the Thornton family's precious jewel—practically her own little sister. If anything happened to her because of their carelessness—

"Isabella! Isabella!" Her voice cracked as she shouted, shoving through the throng of people. Tears pricked at her eyes.

Nathaniel's hands settled firmly on her shoulders, steadying her. His voice was low, controlled. "She couldn’t have gone far. I’ll have security lock down the exits. We’ll find her."

Vivian bit her lip, staring up at him. Despite everything, she trusted him to fix this. If anyone could, it was Nathaniel Blackwood.

Their gazes locked, tension coiling between them—

Then a bloodcurdling scream shattered the moment.

"HELP! HE'S GOT A KNIFE!"
###Chapter 214

Vivian's brows furrowed deeply as she seized a fleeing woman's arm. "What's happening?"

"A madman—he's taken a little girl hostage in the main hall! He's wearing explosives!" The woman trembled violently.

"A child?" Vivian's stomach twisted. "Was she about five years old? Wearing a yellow sundress?"

The woman blinked rapidly before nodding. "Yes! You need to evacuate—that bomb could kill everyone here!"

The crowd surged toward the emergency exits like panicked cattle.

Vivian turned toward the escalators, but Ethan blocked her path. "Where do you think you're going?"

"To save Isabella!" Vivian's voice cracked. "That lunatic has her! If I don't—"

Ethan pointed to the glowing exit signs. "Get out. Now." His jaw tightened. "I'll handle this."

Then he was gone—plunging into the chaos with shoulders squared. Vivian watched his retreating figure, stunned. She'd spent years hating this man, yet here he was, charging toward certain danger.

The first floor had become a ghost town, save for the SWAT team's armored shadows.

At the center stood a disheveled man pressing a hunting knife to Isabella's throat. "No negotiations!" he screamed at the hostage negotiator. "Today, we all die!"

The crude explosives strapped to his waist made every officer flinch. One wrong move would reduce the entire mall to rubble.

"Sir, let's talk this through," the negotiator pleaded. "We can help resolve whatever—"

"Help?" The man's laugh turned into a sob. "Where was your help when they bulldozed my home? My wife and daughter were still inside!" His grip tightened on the knife. "Now your precious children will know how mine felt!"

Isabella whimpered, tears streaking her cheeks. "P-please, mister..."

The man's wild gaze softened momentarily. "You look just like her...my little girl." Then his expression hardened. "But you've never known hunger. Never slept in the cold. Your rich parents gave you everything!"

Ethan's voice cut through the tension like ice. "This isn't about justice. You want money? Name your price."

"Money?" The bomber's face purpled with rage. "What use is money when my family's bones are buried under this damned shopping center? Today, the privileged learn what suffering means!"

"You could kill us all," Vivian said softly, stepping from the shadows.

Ethan's head snapped toward her. "I told you to leave." His whisper carried lethal warning.

Ignoring him, Vivian locked eyes with the hostage-taker. "But have you considered what happens after?" Her voice remained steady despite the gun barrels suddenly trained on her. "Your daughter's memory—will it be as a victim? Or the daughter of a monster?"
###Chapter 215

The man's face twisted with rage as he spat, "You'll all burn with me! Consequences mean nothing!"

Vivian stepped forward, her voice steady. "What about Margaret and Abigail? Have you thought what your actions will do to them?"

"Are you deaf? They're gone! I want you all to join them!" His scream echoed through the space.

A cold smile touched Vivian's lips. "Death isn't the end, you fool." She took another step closer.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The man was strapped with explosives—approaching him was suicide.

Nathaniel's knuckles turned bone-white. Every instinct screamed to drag Vivian to safety, but one wrong move could trigger disaster. His jaw clenched, eyes dark with fury.

Yet Vivian moved like she had all the time in the world, speaking as if to an old friend. "Hell isn't just fire and brimstone. Souls carry their sins into the next life. The guilty suffer for eternity, never reborn."

Her words dripped with eerie certainty. "This girl comes from privilege—her fate is written in gold. But you? You're staining your family's souls with fresh sins. They'll never escape because of you. Is that what you want?"

Some dismissed her as superstitious, but the man faltered. His hands shook. "What choice do I have? They're gone because of greedy bastards who walked free! You expect me to do nothing?"

Vivian's gaze sharpened. "Be as ruthless as you want—but leave the innocent out of it. Fight the ones who wronged you. Killing bystanders won't bring justice."

A bitter laugh tore from him. "Justice? The system failed them! If they can't move on, then we'll stay together—forever!"

She saw the madness returning. Time for Plan B.

"Fine. But she's protected by fate. Take me instead." Vivian lifted her chin. "I've studied the afterlife for years. I can guide your family through the darkness."

The blade glinted as he yanked her against him. "Hands behind your back. Now."

Nathaniel's roar shattered the tension. "Vivian, don't you dare!"

She ignored him, swapping places with Isabella in one smooth motion. The knife pressed to her throat.

Cameras rolled, broadcasting her sacrifice live. Viewers held their breaths.

Nathaniel advanced, every muscle coiled. "Let. Her. Go." His voice was lethal. "Or I'll put a bullet between your eyes."

He'd signaled the snipers earlier—one word, and this ended. But Vivian's recklessness had thrown him. The image of that blade slicing her skin haunted him.

For the first time, Nathaniel understood: he couldn't lose her.

The man's grip tightened. "Shoot me, and she dies first!"

The knife drew a thin line of crimson.
###Chapter 216

Vivian moved like lightning. Her palm struck the man's chest with brutal force.

He gasped, doubling over as pain radiated through his body. Staggering backward, he lost his grip on her.

The crowd gasped in shock.

"You little—! This is your fault!" The man's face twisted with rage. His fingers yanked the bomb's safety pin.

Screams erupted around them.

"Move!"

Strong arms wrapped around Vivian, pulling her against a solid chest. She blinked up into Nathaniel's stormy eyes. His embrace felt like sanctuary—an unshakable fortress amidst chaos.

The explosion never came.

Only a pathetic puff of white smoke escaped the device.

"What—? Why didn't it—?" The man gaped at the inert bomb strapped to his waist. Confusion rippled through the onlookers.

Vivian smoothly extracted herself from Nathaniel's hold. A triumphant smirk curved her lips. "Your design was decent. But the safety mechanism? Pathetic." She flicked a nonexistent speck of dust from her sleeve. "I disabled it the moment you grabbed me. The gunpowder's been leaking for minutes."

The man's jaw dropped. "How the hell do you know bomb mechanics?"

"Enough to dismantle amateur toys like yours." Her smirk widened. The crude device had been child's play—she could've disabled it in her sleep.

"Damn, girl." Even as security subdued him, the man shook his head in grudging respect.

Murmurs of admiration spread through the crowd. No one expected the elegant woman in designer heels to possess such lethal skills.

Vivian shot Nathaniel a cheeky glance. "Saved your life again. You're welcome."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. Without a word, he turned on his heel and strode away.

"Hey! That's how you thank your savior?" Vivian huffed, hands on hips. What was his problem now? She took a step to follow—

A woman burst through the crowd, sobbing. "Isabella! My darling Isabella!" She flung her arms around the trembling girl.
###Chapter 217

The woman standing before them was none other than Isabella's biological mother, Victoria Chen.

"Isabella, are you hurt?" Victoria's voice trembled as she noticed the blood on her daughter's neck. "We need to get you to a hospital immediately!"

She scooped Isabella into her arms, her hands shaking as she inspected the wound. Tears blurred her vision.

Victoria had been reviewing case files when the breaking news flashed across her screen. The moment she recognized her daughter in that live broadcast, her blood ran cold.

She abandoned everything and sped to the mall, her heart pounding the entire way.

Thankfully, the injuries were minor—thanks to Vivian's quick thinking.

Victoria had never spared Vivian a second glance before. Now, gratitude overwhelmed her.

"You saved her." Her voice cracked. "If you hadn't been here… I don't even want to think about what could've happened. You didn't just save Isabella—you saved me too. I owe you everything."

Vivian shifted uncomfortably. "Anyone would've done the same. But… thanks."

Victoria wiped her eyes and smirked. "Don't get the wrong idea. I still don't like you. But if you ever need a favor, just ask."

Vivian sighed. Some people were impossible to please.

Then Isabella suddenly squirmed out of Victoria's arms and hid behind Vivian.

"Who are you?" The little girl glared. "Strangers aren't allowed to touch me! I'm calling the police!"

Victoria flinched as if struck.

Vivian squeezed Isabella's hand gently. "She's not a bad person, sweetheart. Look how worried she is about you."

Isabella hesitated, studying the elegant woman. "She seems… familiar. Like someone from my dreams."

Vivian opened her mouth to explain—

"Stop." Victoria's voice turned icy. She crouched to Isabella's eye level. "You're right to be cautious. I'm not a good person. Stay away from me."

She straightened and fixed Vivian with a piercing stare. "Take her to the hospital. And keep your mouth shut about today."

With one last lingering look at Isabella, Victoria turned on her heel and walked away.

Vivian watched her go. That woman carried too many secrets.

Isabella tugged her sleeve. "Who was that? I want to be her friend! Why did she leave?"

Vivian hesitated. "She's… someone very brave. Promise me something, Isabella. No matter what happens, you'll forgive her. Okay?"

Isabella nodded solemnly, though she didn't understand. "Okay."
###Chapter 218

The mall slowly emptied, returning to its usual quiet state.

Vivian examined Isabella's neck with concern. "It's not deep, but we should still get it checked. Let's go to the hospital."

She glanced around for Ethan, but he was gone. Her chest tightened with frustration. How could he be so cold? They'd just survived a life-threatening situation, and he'd simply walked away without a word!

Vivian guided Isabella toward the mall entrance to flag down a cab. Just then, Ethan's sleek silver car rolled to a stop in front of them.

Her tense shoulders relaxed slightly. Maybe he wasn’t completely heartless after all. She opened the back door and helped Isabella inside before sliding in herself.

Ethan sat behind the wheel, sunglasses hiding his eyes. "Isabella can stay. You—get out," he said, voice icy.

"What?!" Vivian gaped at him. Was he serious?

"It's sweltering out here, and I nearly died back there. You want me to walk? Are you trying to finish the job?" Her grip on the door tightened.

"Kill you?" Ethan scoffed. "I don’t need to. You seemed perfectly willing to throw your life away earlier. Clearly, you don’t value it much."

Her jaw clenched. What was his problem? She'd risked everything to save those people, and instead of gratitude, he was treating her like this?

"Ethan, are you jealous?" she challenged.

"Jealous?" His brow furrowed slightly.

"I single-handedly saved everyone in that mall while you stood there useless. Bet it stings, doesn’t it? That I stole your spotlight?"

For a moment, Ethan just stared. Then, despite himself, a smirk tugged at his lips. Her logic was absurd—but oddly refreshing. Let her think it was jealousy rather than the gut-wrenching fear he’d felt watching her in danger.

The truth was harder to admit. The idea of losing her had shaken him to his core. He’d have died for her without hesitation—and that terrified him. For the first time, he’d lost control, and it was all because of her.

That was why he’d snapped. Because the alternative—acknowledging how much she meant to him—was unthinkable.
###Chapter 219

The hospital loomed before them, its sterile white walls a stark contrast to the chaos they'd just escaped.

Dr. Chen examined Isabella's injury with practiced hands before turning to Ethan and Vivian. "It's superficial. Keep it dry and apply this ointment twice daily."

Vivian exhaled in relief. She squeezed Isabella's fingers. "I'm so sorry, Bella. This never should've happened."

Isabella blinked up at her, then ruffled Vivian's hair like she was the child. "Don't be ridiculous. You were incredible back there."

Her gaze shifted to Ethan. "Don't you think she was amazing?"

Ethan's jaw tightened. "I think she's clinically insane."

The memory of that knife flashing toward Vivian still made his blood run cold. One second slower, one wrong move—

"Since we're here," he said abruptly to the doctor, "run a full neurological workup on her."

Vivian's eyes flashed. "Excuse me? I save your life and this is my thanks?"

Ethan ignored her, addressing Dr. Chen with lethal calm. "Scan everything. I suspect systemic dysfunction."

"Over my dead body!" Vivian crossed her arms. "Doctor, ignore this lunatic. We're leaving."

She tugged Isabella toward the exit.

Ethan moved faster, blocking the elevator doors. "Reckless. Suicidal." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If I ever see you pull a stunt like that again—"

The doors slid shut between them.

Vivian stared at the polished metal, stunned.

"Isabella," she muttered, "what the hell just happened?"

The younger girl tilted her head. "He's worried about you. My dad gets that same constipated look when Mom skips her meds."

"Worried?" Vivian scoffed. But the word lodged in her chest like shrapnel.

Ethan's recent behavior—the hovering, the outbursts—clicked into place.

Not concern.

Calculations.

Something far more dangerous than knives or bombs.
###Chapter 220

That had to be the answer!

The following morning at Blackwood Legal.

Julian Montgomery blinked rapidly, unable to believe his eyes. Vivian Lockhart had actually tamed Victoria Chen - the firm's most notoriously difficult attorney - in just seventy-two hours.

Not only had Victoria not terminated her contract, she'd started accepting cases for the firm again.

"Boss, you're incredible!" Julian slipped into Vivian's office, giving her an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

Vivian remained focused on the legal brief in her hands. Without glancing up, she said, "Mr. Montgomery, do you need more work? I can assign you some new cases immediately."

"No, thank you!" Julian waved his hands frantically. He circled Vivian's desk with undisguised admiration. "Boss, everyone saw how you disarmed that explosive device yesterday. Where did you learn that? Are you secretly special forces?"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "My grandfather was Arthur Lockhart, a decorated general. I could dismantle explosives before I could read."

"No way!" Julian's jaw dropped. "My boss is a general's granddaughter? What else can you do? Hand-to-hand combat? Firearm disassembly?"

"Child's play - I could do them blindfolded." Vivian flashed a proud grin. "If you're interested, I might teach you sometime."

"Yes, please!" Suddenly, a crowd of eavesdropping employees burst through the door. Their eyes shone with hero worship.

If the staff had initially respected Vivian only because of her marriage to Nathaniel Blackwood, they now revered her for her own merits. They'd follow her anywhere.

Their boss was a general's descendant who could disarm bombs, dismantle weapons, and fight like a commando? Absolutely legendary!

"I'll teach you all, but I'll need to procure equipment first. One day each week for training," Vivian offered generously.

"Equipment?" Though confused, the team buzzed with excitement. The office erupted in animated chatter.

The room fell silent instantly when Victoria Chen entered, arms laden with case files.

Everyone except Julian scattered immediately. The fear Victoria commanded as one of the firm's three senior partners was palpable.

"I've cracked the case you brought in. Got a minute?" Victoria asked directly, her tailored suit emphasizing her professional demeanor.

"Of course. I've been expecting you!" Vivian's eyes sparkled. Finally securing Victoria's cooperation felt like a major victory.
###Chapter 221

"Let's make it happen!" Vivian Lockhart's eyes sparkled with excitement after hearing Victoria Chen's plan. "Ms. Chen, I have to admit—you've outdone yourself. Solving such a complex case? No wonder I needed you at my firm."

She leaned back in her chair, a triumphant smirk playing on her lips. "With you three by my side, there's nothing I can't conquer. Not just Newport City—the entire world will be mine!"

Julian Montgomery chuckled. "Boss, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Taking over the whole city might be a stretch, but securing thirty to forty percent? That’s realistic."

Vivian’s smile faltered. "Only thirty to forty? What about the rest?"

Nathan Prescott smirked. "Isn’t it obvious? The remaining sixty to seventy percent belongs to your ex-husband—our former boss, Ethan Blackwood."

The Blackwoods were one of the Elite Eight families of Newport City, and the other seven weren’t pushovers either. The Lockharts had once stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them, but mistakes had cost them dearly. Reclaiming even a fraction of their former glory would be a monumental achievement.

Victoria, who had been silently observing, finally spoke. "Don’t sell yourself short. Win this case, and the Blackwoods will become nothing more than your personal ATM. Surpassing them isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable."

Vivian exhaled slowly, her voice softening. "The Lockharts used to rival the Blackwoods. But one misstep after another…" She clenched her fists. "I’m the last Lockhart standing. I can’t afford another failure."

Julian shook his head internally. These women are dreaming too big. One court case won’t topple the most powerful family in Newport City.

That night, at The Starlight Lounge.

Ethan, Dominic Harrington, and Oliver Prescott occupied the VIP section, drowning their thoughts in glass after glass of whiskey.

Their presence alone drew the attention of every woman in the bar—each of them exuding a different kind of magnetism.

Oliver popped open another bottle, pouring generously. "Cheer up, guys. This is our last night as free men! After tonight, Dominic’s getting shackled to Olivia Sinclair forever. And trust me, that woman doesn’t tolerate fools."

Dominic swirled his drink, watching the amber liquid catch the dim light. There was no trace of joy on his face—just a heavy silence.

Oliver frowned. "You’re marrying the love of your life. Why the long face?"

Dominic didn’t answer. Instead, he glanced at Ethan, whose expression was equally grim. "Ethan, you’ve been through this. Tell me—did you feel this way before your wedding?"

Ethan stared into his glass, lost in thought. After a long pause, he shook his head. "I don’t remember much. Just… disgust."

"Disgust?" Dominic’s brows furrowed. "With marriage itself, or the person you married?"

Another slow shake of his head. "Maybe both."

Four years had passed since Ethan and Vivian’s wedding. Most of it was a blur—except for one thing.

Vivian had been breathtaking that day.

Her wedding dress—ivory with delicate sapphire embroidery—had made her look ethereal. She’d been shy, her cheeks flushed, unable to meet his eyes.

Back then, she’d been soft. Fragile. Someone he’d wanted to protect.

Now? She glared at him like she wanted to bury him alive.

Oliver scoffed. "Of course he was disgusted! He was forced into that marriage. But you, Dominic? You and Olivia actually love each other. After everything you’ve been through, you should be thrilled!"

Dominic and Ethan exchanged a look.

Then, without a word, they clinked their glasses together.

"Yeah," Dominic muttered. "I’m marrying Olivia because I love her. And Ethan’s divorcing Vivian because they don’t. So why do we both feel like we’re losing?"
###Chapter 222

Nathaniel's question instantly sucked the air out of the room.

Oliver let out an exasperated sigh. "I can't believe you two are actually debating love. That's never been my problem. No woman's worth giving up my freedom for."

He drained his whiskey and slammed the glass down. "But if I lose this damn case, freedom's off the table anyway! Enough moping - let's do something fun."

"Like what?" Dominic perked up immediately.

"How about a drinking game? Loser takes whatever punishment we dish out."

"Boring." Nathaniel's voice was flat. Clearly not interested.

Then something clicked. "Is it a counting game?" he asked suddenly.

"Sure, whatever you want." Oliver shrugged.

"Let's do that then." Nathaniel's sudden enthusiasm surprised them. Truth was, he couldn't accept losing to Vivian every single time. This was his chance to prove whether he sucked at the game or if she was just that good.

The game began.

Workaholic Nathaniel rarely went out, so predictably, he lost spectacularly to Dominic and Oliver.

He waited for his punishment like a man.

"My turn first!" Oliver announced. "Nathaniel, call your wife right now. Minimum ten minutes."

"No." Instant refusal.

Oliver smirked. "What, scared of a little phone call? Didn't take you for a coward."

Provoked, Nathaniel pulled out his phone. Dialed. Then realized with a jolt - Vivian had blocked his number. The call wouldn't even connect.

Dominic and Oliver howled with laughter. Exactly the reaction they'd hoped for.

"My turn." Dominic finally caught his breath. "Don't worry, I'll go easy on you."

He nodded toward the entrance. "Dance with the second person who walks in. Simple enough?"

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "Child's play."

A dance with a stranger? He was confident anyone would accept.

The first entrant was a sharply dressed man.

Then a vision in white glided through the doors - a stunning woman with an aura that commanded attention.
###Chapter 223

The girl had delicate features, with doe-like eyes that sparkled with innocence. She carried herself like a university freshman, clearly out of her element in this sophisticated setting.

Three pairs of male eyes tracked her movement as she nervously approached the bar and took a seat.

Nathaniel gave Ethan's shoulder a playful shove. "Damn, Blackwood. You've got all the luck tonight. Meanwhile, I keep attracting cougars and silver foxes. What's stopping you? Go ask her to dance already."

Dominic nodded in agreement. "She does have a certain charm. Reminds me of Isabella, actually - just without the razor-sharp tongue. I'd bet my last dollar she'll say yes."

Ethan remained silent, his gaze fixed on the girl in the ivory dress.

She sat alone at the bar, fingers tapping nervously against her glass. Every furtive glance around the room screamed first-timer.

That wide-eyed vulnerability struck a chord - it was Vivian all over again during their early days.

Ethan pushed back his chair and made his approach.

The girl noticed him immediately, his commanding presence impossible to ignore. With each step he took, her breathing grew more erratic. Pink flooded her cheeks as she hastily looked down at her drink.

"Waiting for someone?" Ethan asked coolly, stopping before her.

"Me?" Her voice came out in a squeak. She glanced around as if expecting a hidden camera crew. "I mean... yes? No? I just..."

Ethan's lips quirked at her flustered response - so reminiscent of Vivian's early awkwardness around him. "Disappointed it's me asking?"

"No! I mean... I hoped... God, this is embarrassing." She shook her head violently. "I'm just surprised someone like you would notice me."

"Then dance with me." Ethan extended his hand.

"Y-yes!" The girl practically tripped over herself standing up, placing her trembling hand in his.

From their booth, Dominic and Nathaniel watched the scene unfold with matching grins.

"I'll be damned," Dominic muttered. "First time I've seen Blackwood make the first move. Guess marriage changed him after all."

"With that face? Please," Nathaniel scoffed. "I could pull that off too if I won the genetic lottery."

"Funniest part? The man actually asked me for dating advice last week." Nathaniel barked out a laugh. "Gave him all these elaborate strategies, and what does he do? Walks up and asks her to dance. Makes me look like an idiot!"

Dominic's gaze lingered on the dance floor. "Don't beat yourself up. Pretty sure someone's rejection lit a fire under him."

"No kidding," Nathaniel smirked. "Remember when Isabella used to jump at his every command? Now she's the one calling the shots. Karma's a bitch."

Their conversation halted abruptly as Vivian, Liam, and Sophia entered the lounge, laughing over some shared joke.

"Told you this place was perfect," Liam announced, leading the way. "Upscale crowd, live jazz, none of that obnoxious club nonsense."

As a regular at The Starlight Lounge, Liam knew the establishment maintained strict entry policies - ensuring an exclusive clientele of socialites and power players. The ideal spot for discreet enjoyment.
###Chapter 224

Vivian Lockhart stood out effortlessly in her simple white dress. Her minimal makeup and casually swept hair created an illusion of innocence, yet there was an undeniable magnetism about her.

She took a satisfied sip of her drink. "This place isn't bad at all. We should make this our regular spot. Having Victoria Chen join the firm was the best decision - it's like a weight's been lifted. We deserve to celebrate..."

Her words trailed off as she noticed Sophia staring intently across the room.

"Viv, doesn't that guy on the dance floor look exactly like your ex?" Sophia whispered, gripping Vivian's arm nervously.

Following Sophia's gaze, Vivian's breath caught. It was indeed Ethan Blackwood.

Liam and Sophia exchanged worried glances, bracing for Vivian's reaction.

But Vivian merely shrugged. "Ex-husband, not husband. Get your terms right, people."

"Boss, if this makes you uncomfortable, we can go somewhere else. How about-"

"Why should we leave?" Vivian interrupted sharply, tossing her hair back as she strode confidently toward their reserved table. "This lounge doesn't belong to him. If he can enjoy himself here, so can I."

"Damn right!" Liam grinned, leading the way. "Let's show them how to really have fun."

Fate placed their VIP table directly across from Ethan's group.

Nathan Prescott and Dominic Harrington spotted Vivian immediately, shifting uncomfortably in their seats.

Vivian raised her glass toward them in a graceful, indifferent toast.

Dominic returned the gesture, his eyes lighting up with admiration.

Nathan glared at his friend. "Dominic, what the hell?"

"Relax, Nathan. Vivian's being remarkably civil considering everything. She's handled the divorce with more class than anyone expected," Dominic reasoned.

"You've got to be kidding! Ethan was the victim here. She trapped him into marriage. If she was so classy, why did she block him everywhere?" Nathan argued heatedly.

While the two men bickered, Vivian had already ordered another round.

She chose a light fruit-infused wine - perfectly safe despite her condition.

"Phones out, people! Let's play!" Vivian demanded excitedly, already pulling up the trending mobile game. She hadn't so much as glanced toward the dance floor since sitting down, behaving as if Ethan were invisible.

Sophia and Liam shared another meaningful look.

"Viv... you're really okay with this? You don't have to pretend with us," Sophia ventured carefully.

Vivian rolled her eyes. "I told you - ex-husband. Why would I care?" Her focus remained entirely on her phone screen. "Less talking, more gaming. We need a fourth for this raid."

Liam studied her skeptically. Had she truly moved on? "There's only three of us. How are we making a team of four?"

A mysterious smile played on Vivian's lips. "Don't worry about that... I know just the person to complete our squad."
###Chapter 225

Sophia's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "A pro? Male or female? Gorgeous? What's your connection?" She could sniff out gossip like a bloodhound.

Vivian flashed a cryptic smile. "Male, and yes, devastatingly handsome. You've met him before."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Who is he to you?" The edge in his voice betrayed his jealousy.

Ignoring him, Vivian pulled out her phone and dialed.

"Just keep walking straight," she instructed after a brief exchange.

Moments later, a striking figure appeared at the lounge entrance. His black mask accentuated the intensity of his piercing gaze.

Vivian stood, waving eagerly. "Over here!"

Nathaniel, Sophia, Dominic, and Oliver all turned in unison.

The stranger approached, then removed his mask.

Sophia gasped. "Wait—isn't he like a carbon copy of Nathaniel?"

Vivian rolled her eyes. "Don't insult him. This is Julian Carter. You literally introduced us, remember?"

She gestured for Julian to sit beside her. "Long drive? Hands okay? We need you sharp for the match. These two are dead weight—it's all on us now."

Julian settled in, his demeanor ice-cool. He unlocked his phone with a flick of his wrist. "Easy."

"Enough chitchat—let's crush this!" Vivian declared, herding everyone toward the gaming area.

Nathaniel's initial jealousy faded when he saw Vivian's laser focus on the game, her attention purely strategic. He followed without another word.

Time to impress her with my skills, he thought, gripping his phone tighter.

The quartet dove into the match, their intensity drawing bewildered stares from other patrons.

Dominic frowned. "Julian Carter? The reclusive genius actually knows Vivian?"

Oliver scoffed. "Seriously? A Nathaniel lookalike? She’s clearly not over him."

"Of course they look alike," Dominic muttered. "Julian’s his cousin. The Blackwoods disowned his branch, but the man’s a tech prodigy—QuantumTech’s lead engineer and majority shareholder, 'Mr. Y.'"

Oliver’s jaw dropped. "That’s Mr. Y?!"

Rumors swirled about Mr. Y and Nathaniel’s "unusual" bond—some even claimed they’d married overseas. The truth was far simpler: family ties explained QuantumTech’s exclusive partnership with Blackwood Group. Their symbiotic success was undeniable.

Oliver squinted at Julian, now fully immersed in the game. "Genius engineer my ass. Dude’s a basement-dwelling gamer. Probably pays someone to do his job."

Dominic smirked. "Even geniuses need hobbies. Bet you’d lose your mind if you knew his other alias."
###Chapter 226

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "Explain."

Dominic grinned. "He's the visual center of Nova Boys, the hottest new idol group. Fans call him 'Mini Nathaniel Blackwood'."

Oliver nearly choked on his whiskey.

A chief engineer. A professional gamer. And now the face of a K-pop sensation?

Julian Carter was full of surprises.

"If he's an idol, why bother with chip development?" Oliver questioned.

Dominic shrugged. "Maybe research got dull. The guy clearly enjoys reinventing himself."

His gaze lingered on Julian across the room, admiration flashing in his eyes.

Few could live so freely - switching careers like changing suits.

On the dance floor, Nathaniel moved mechanically with the woman in ivory silk. His attention kept drifting to where Vivian stood.

When she first entered, guilt had prickled at him. He'd deliberately maintained distance, worried she might misinterpret things.

But Vivian hadn't even glanced his way.

She'd walked past as if he were part of the wallpaper.

That casual indifference burned worse than anger. And now she was chatting up Julian like old friends.

First Liam. Now his own cousin.

Vivian seemed to be collecting male admirers tonight.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. Confronting her now would make him look unhinged. So he kept dancing, forcing himself to focus on his partner.

He recalled Oliver's dating advice: After winning a woman's attention, sometimes you had to let her go.

"What's your name?" Nathaniel's voice dropped an octave.

The girl stammered, "C-Cassandra Whitmore."

"Whitmore?" Nathaniel's lips twitched at her porcelain skin. "Fitting."

Their conversation flowed easily under the glittering chandeliers, creating an intimate tableau.

"Boss! You're AFK! Enemy behind you!"

The urgent shouts snapped Vivian back to reality. Her champion lay dead onscreen, costing their team the match.

"Sorry," she muttered, cheeks flushing. "Got distracted."

Sophia frowned. "You never zone out during ranked games. What happened?"

Julian set down his phone, following Vivian's earlier line of sight to the dance floor. His expression turned thoughtful.

"Care to dance?" he offered suddenly.
###Chapter 227

"Dance?" Vivian cleared her throat awkwardly, feigning disinterest. "I don't really enjoy dancing."

Nathaniel smirked, his gaze sharp and challenging. "Is that the truth, or are you just afraid?"

"Afraid? Don't be ridiculous." Vivian scoffed but couldn't hold his piercing stare.

His eyes reminded her too much of Ethan—that same unnerving intensity that made her feel exposed, as if he could see straight through her carefully constructed walls.

Of course, she cared that Ethan was dancing with another woman. She was just pretending not to, but her acting skills were clearly lacking. The moment she saw him laughing with that girl in the white dress, her composure shattered. She'd been so distracted she'd completely ruined the game for her team.

"If you're not afraid, then dance with me." Julian extended his hand again. "Trust me, it'll make you feel better."

Though he was Ethan's nephew, Julian was only a year and a half younger. Raised abroad with more freedom, he lacked Ethan's calculated restraint—more open, more reckless.

Vivian bit her lip, hesitating. Dancing would make her feelings too obvious, but refusing would make her look weak.

Liam had noticed too—Vivian wasn't over Ethan. Otherwise, she wouldn't have faltered during her best game.

And Ethan knew she was here. So why was he dancing so intimately with another woman? It was deliberate. A provocation.

As Vivian's most loyal protector, Liam refused to let her lose.

He stepped forward, offering his own hand. "Boss, if you're going to dance, it should be with me. We've known each other for years. We'd be better partners."

The attention in the bar shifted instantly. Whispers spread as women shot envious glances at Vivian. Two gorgeous men vying for her? Unfair.

"You're both impossible," Vivian muttered, cheeks burning under the scrutiny. She didn't want to choose either—until she caught Ethan's gaze.

His stare was icy. A warning. Then he leaned down, whispering something to the girl in white.

Ugh. What a jerk.
###Chapter 228

Vivian rose instantly to her feet. Her fingers brushed Nathaniel's cheek before ruffling Julian Carter's hair with playful possessiveness. The gesture resembled a queen selecting her court favorites. "One's dashing with infectious energy, while the other's mysterious and intense. Why choose when I can have both?"

"Julian gets first dance privileges - he traveled farthest after all." She winked at Nathaniel. "Be patient, darling. Your queen will return."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Women typically threw themselves at him, and his smoldering gaze confirmed he knew his worth. Yet he inclined his head obediently. "As you wish, boss. Entertain the imitation first. Save the main event for me."

Vivian rewarded his compliance with another caress before accepting Julian's outstretched hand. He guided her to the dance floor with practiced ease, their chemistry palpable.

A collective sigh rippled through the female patrons, elbows propped on tables as they watched enviously.

"That woman's living every girl's fantasy! Two breathtaking men competing for her attention..."

"She must be loaded or blessed by the universe. No ordinary woman pulls that off!"

Across the venue, Dominic Harrington and Oliver Prescott observed the scene with raised eyebrows.

"Told you she wasn't some naive ingenue," Oliver muttered, swirling his bourbon. "Julian Montgomery doesn't do puppy love, and Nathaniel Blackwood certainly doesn't wait his turn. Yet she's got them both wrapped around her finger. Ethan never stood a chance."

Dominic's lips quirked as he sipped his scotch. "Ethan's going to lose his mind when he sees this."

As Vivian and Julian moved toward the dance floor's center, spotlights serendipitously illuminated them, casting Ethan and Cassandra Whitmore into the same glowing circle.

Ethan's glacial stare could've frozen lava. "Impressive social climbing. I expected Liam's puppy devotion, but seducing my nephew? That's... ambitious."

His nephew? Vivian's pulse stuttered, but her expression remained flawlessly composed. She wouldn't give Ethan the satisfaction of seeing her rattled.

Her arms slid around Julian's shoulders as they began moving to the sultry rhythm. "Flattery will get you everywhere, Mr. Blackwood. Though I'm sure you consider me worthless, these gentlemen seem to find me... valuable enough to fight over."

Ethan's eyes darkened dangerously before shifting to Julian. "Since when do you associate with gold diggers?"

Julian's poker face remained unreadable. "No agenda here. Just enjoying a dance with a beautiful woman."

Meanwhile, Cassandra in Ethan's arms resembled a startled rabbit caught in headlights. Her wide eyes darted between them nervously. "M-Mr. Blackwood, I think there's some misunderstanding... Should I... leave?"

Ethan's grip tightened. "I chose you specifically. You're the first partner who can actually follow my lead." His voice dropped dangerously. "Unless you're bored already?"

"Never!" Cassandra flushed. "It's an honor! I trained at Juilliard but never had a partner who moved like you."

Their dancing grew increasingly intimate, bodies molding together with provocative precision.

Vivian's nails dug into Julian's shoulders. Get a room, she thought bitterly.

Then a pained cry shattered the moment.
###Chapter 229

Vivian's gaze dropped to where her stiletto was crushing Julian's polished leather shoe. Heat flooded her cheeks as she jerked her foot away. "God, I'm such a klutz," she muttered through clenched teeth.

Julian's lips quirked as he adjusted his grip on her waist. "Should I be offended? My dance partner can't even keep her eyes on me."

That earned him another deliberate stomp from Vivian's designer heel. "Must you embarrass me?" she hissed, shooting a furtive glance toward Ethan. The last thing she needed was her ex-husband witnessing her awkwardness.

The music faded as the overhead lights dimmed. Julian abruptly released her, his voice carrying just enough to reach Ethan's group. "Since we're clearly incompatible, perhaps we should switch partners?"

Vivian's jaw dropped. Before she could protest, Julian was already bowing before Cassandra. "May I have this dance?"

Cassandra's cheeks pinked as she stared at the man who could be Ethan's twin. Her fingers fluttered nervously before accepting his hand. The entire bar seemed to hold its breath - two devastatingly handsome men, each with their own dangerous appeal.

Ethan's voice sliced through the tension. "An excellent suggestion." In three strides he stood before Vivian, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "Shall we?"

Every rational thought screamed refusal, yet her traitorous hand slid into his palm. The opening notes of a Viennese waltz filled the air.

Muscle memory took over. Vivian's spine straightened as Ethan's arm encircled her waist, their bodies moving in perfect synchronization despite years apart. To onlookers, they appeared the picture of elegance - two souls moving as one.

The intimate dance pressed them closer than propriety allowed. Vivian's nose brushed against Ethan's collar, inhaling his signature bergamot scent. "How quickly you've moved on, Mr. Blackwood," she murmured. "That college girl can't be more than twenty."

The words tasted bitter even as she spoke them. What right did she have to question him now?

Ethan's hand tightened at the small of her back. "Would you prefer I spend my nights alone, pining for you?" His breath warmed her ear as they turned in perfect unison.

"Don't flatter yourself." Vivian forced a laugh that sounded hollow even to her. "I just hate seeing naive girls get hurt by men like you."

"Naive?" Ethan's chuckle vibrated through her. "Reminds me of someone four years ago." His fingers traced her spine through the thin silk of her dress. "Tell me, Vivian - are you jealous?"

The music crescendoed, masking her sharp intake of breath. Their bodies pressed flush together, heartbeat to heartbeat, as the final notes hung in the air between them.
###Chapter 230

Vivian's cheeks burned crimson as she deliberately avoided Ethan's piercing gaze. Her mind went completely blank, tongue-tied under his intense scrutiny.

A smug satisfaction surged through Ethan. "Your silence speaks volumes," he taunted, tightening his grip on her waist. "You still have feelings for me, don't you? You can't let go."

Vivian stumbled over her own feet, her nervous missteps making Ethan wince in pain.

Coward! She mentally berated herself. Gathering her courage, she met his gaze head-on. "Mr. Blackwood, your arrogance is astounding. I never loved you in the first place - how could I possibly need to move on?"

"Still putting up that tough act," Ethan murmured, his breath hot against her ear. "We both know the truth."

Vivian's face flamed hotter as the music abruptly ended. Like flipping a switch, Ethan's expression turned cold and detached. He released her instantly, the intimate moment shattered as if it never happened.

Her heart sank when Ethan immediately sought out Cassandra Whitmore. "Care for a drink?" he asked the blonde, his voice dripping with charm.

Cassandra had been distracted throughout her dance with Julian Montgomery, her attention fixated on Ethan and Vivian. Though Julian was handsome, her obsession with Ethan ran deeper - it had been love at first sight.

"Of course," Cassandra gushed, practically glowing with excitement as they walked past Vivian without a second glance.

The dismissal cut deeper than any blade. Vivian's chest constricted painfully. That man was pure poison!

Julian shrugged helplessly. "I tried," he offered apologetically.

Returning to their table, Liam took one look at Vivian's devastated expression and scowled. "Boss, what did that bastard say to you? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Vivian downed her fruit wine in one swallow. "Nothing unexpected from him," she muttered bitterly, though her trembling hands betrayed her.

Liam's fists clenched. Knowing Vivian carried Ethan's children made the situation even more infuriating. "Tell me what he said. I'll make him regret it."

"Go ahead," Vivian challenged darkly. "Just make sure you finish the job."

She meant it as a joke - Liam might look reckless, but he was far more calculating than he appeared.

To her shock, Liam grabbed a wine bottle and stormed toward Ethan's table with murder in his eyes.
###Chapter 231

Vivian's breath hitched. The tension between Nathaniel and Liam was so thick she could slice it with a knife. If this escalated into a physical altercation in front of Newport City's elite society, the scandal would be catastrophic.

She rose to intervene, but Sophia's firm grip stopped her. "Relax," Liam's sister murmured. "My brother always plays the long game. Watch."

Vivian exhaled slowly. Of course. Liam Osborne wasn't called the Silver Fox of Newport for nothing. The man who'd outmaneuvered three corporate raiders last quarter wouldn't lose his cool now.

Nathaniel remained impassive as Liam approached, his champagne flute untouched. Only the tightening of his jaw betrayed any reaction.

Nathan Prescott, ever the hothead, shot to his feet. "Got a death wish, Osborne?"

Liam's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Just paying respects to Newport's finest." He raised his glass. "To old money and older grudges."

Dominic Harrington chuckled, patting the empty seat beside him. "Theodore's son, everyone. The man who turned Osborne Pharma into a billion-dollar empire before thirty." His gaze flicked to Nathaniel. "Sit. Let's see if the rumors about your negotiation skills hold up."

The air crackled as Liam settled beside Nathaniel. Two predators circling in a gilded cage.

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his glass. "This some kind of joke? You're dating his ex-wife!"

Dominic's smile turned glacial. "And you're making us look like jealous exes. Sit. Down."

Everyone knew the Harringtons' political reach extended from Newport to DC. When Dominic Harrington gave an order, even Prescott money obeyed.

Liam swirled his bourbon. "Vivian's moved on. Shouldn't we all?" His thumb brushed the lipstick mark on his glass - Vivian's signature crimson. A deliberate provocation.

Nathaniel's laugh was razor-sharp. "Funny. Last I checked, Lockhart women don't stay bought."

The temperature dropped ten degrees. Even Dominic stiffened.

Then Nathaniel did something unexpected. He clinked his glass against Liam's. "To new beginnings."

Vivian's nails dug into her clutch. This wasn't reconciliation. This was war by other means.

Dominic's phone buzzed. His smirk as he read the message sent chills down Vivian's spine. "Seems the SEC just launched an investigation into Osborne Pharma's clinical trials." He toasted Liam. "Fortune favors the bold, no?"

Liam's grin turned feral. "How timely. I just acquired twenty percent of Blackwood Group's debt." He leaned toward Nathaniel. "Shall we discuss terms... partner?"

The bomb dropped. The entire restaurant held its breath.

Nathaniel's response would determine who ruled Newport's financial empire tomorrow.
###Chapter 232

Nathaniel Blackwood picked up two crystal glasses and poured amber liquid into each—one for himself, the other for Ethan.

"Here's to you." He raised his glass. "Thank you for setting Vivian free. She's thriving now, more confident than ever. You're practically a saint."

Nathaniel downed his drink without hesitation. His words weren't empty politeness—he meant every syllable. If Ethan hadn't been such a cold-hearted bastard and forced the divorce, Vivian would still be nothing more than "Ethan's wife" in everyone's eyes.

Ethan stared at the glass in his hand, emotions churning beneath his composed exterior. Anyone could see Nathaniel's toast was laced with sarcasm, yet part of him agreed with the sentiment.

To everyone's shock, Ethan accepted the drink and smirked. "True. She's different now—like a bird finally out of its cage. Free to fly wherever she pleases."

I thought a woman like her would crumble without the Blackwood name. That no man would want her. But now... His gaze flicked to Julian before returning to Nathaniel. "She's surpassed all expectations. I genuinely hope she finds happiness."

Nathaniel nearly choked on his whiskey. He hadn't expected such a raw admission from the man known for his icy demeanor.

What came next made Nathaniel sound petty in comparison. "How diplomatic of you, Mr. Blackwood. Vivian's doing exceptionally well—so well, in fact, suitors are practically lining up at her door. Gives me a run for my money." He smirked. "Though you seem to be moving on just fine yourself. Barely divorced and already parading a new woman around. Do you change lovers as often as you change ties?"

He expected denial. Ethan and that Vivian lookalike, Cassandra, barely exchanged glances all evening—they might as well have been strangers.

Instead, Ethan pulled Cassandra against him. "She's refreshingly naive. I find her... charming."

The room froze.

Oliver Prescott, ever loyal, jumped in. "Surprised? When Ethan falls, he falls hard. Love at first sight, really."

"Love at first sight?" Nathaniel scoffed. "Then why does she look exactly like Vivian? Are you saying you never loved your wife, but you're smitten with her carbon copy?"

Ethan remained silent. Oliver stepped forward, voice dropping to a growl. "You came here to pick a fight. What's your game?"

Nathaniel laughed. "Relax. I just want a drink. Unless you're scared, Mr. Blackwood?"

Before Ethan could respond, Oliver sneered. "Scared? Please. Drink him under the table, Ethan."

Ethan shot Oliver a withering look. Thanks for volunteering me as tribute.

Nathaniel refilled both glasses, amber liquid catching the light. "Your move." If Ethan had the audacity to play the villain so publicly, Nathaniel had every right to call him out.
###Chapter 233

Liam had heard Vivian mention once that Ethan couldn't hold his liquor—that he turned into a clumsy amateur when it came to drinking games. That was exactly why Liam had brought the strongest vodka he could find. His plan was simple: challenge Ethan to a drinking game, get him wasted, and humiliate him publicly to avenge Vivian.

Liam knew Ethan was prideful. With a little taunting, he'd surely take the bait.

But the plan backfired spectacularly.

Ethan didn’t even glance at the bottle. Instead, he stood abruptly, turning to Dominic and Nathan. "Something came up. I'll catch up with you later."

Then, his gaze shifted to Cassandra. "Come with me."

"Me?" Cassandra's eyes widened in shock. She was just a college student working her first part-time job at the bar. Tonight had already felt surreal—now this?

Ethan didn’t wait for a response. He strode toward the exit.

"W-Wait!" Cassandra grabbed her purse and hurried after him. To her, Ethan wasn’t just a knight in shining armor—he was a lifeline. If there was even a sliver of hope, she’d cling to it.

The bar fell into stunned silence as they left.

Even Nathan, who usually defended Ethan without question, frowned. "What the hell? He barely drank tonight. Is he seriously into that girl? She looks like Vivian’s carbon copy. Ditching the real thing for a knockoff? What’s wrong with him?"

Dominic’s gaze flicked toward the exit, then back to Vivian. A knowing smirk curled his lips. "He’s serious this time."

"About her?" Nathan scoffed. "No way."

Dominic chuckled. "I didn’t say it was about her."

"This is ridiculous. It’s your bachelor party, and he just walks out? Even if he’s into her, couldn’t he wait one damn night?" Nathan muttered.

A man and a woman leaving a bar together? The implications were obvious.

Liam slammed his glass onto the table, his voice dripping with venom. "Ethan’s a heartless bastard. Playing with people’s emotions like that—karma’s coming for him."

He trudged back to Vivian, shoulders slumped. "Sorry, Boss. I failed. Didn’t expect him to be such a piece of work."

Vivian didn’t react. Instead, she shuffled her tarot cards with a serene smile, as if none of this mattered.

"Boss, don’t be upset. You’re divorced. If he’s chasing younger girls, you can too!"

Vivian remained silent, laying the cards out before her. She picked one at random and smiled. "The Sun card. Freedom and happiness. My luck’s changing—nothing to be sad about."

Liam and Sophia exchanged uneasy glances. When someone turned to superstitions for comfort, it meant they were hurting. Vivian might act carefree, but inside? She was barely holding it together.

"I’m tired," Vivian announced suddenly, standing. "Let’s go."

As she passed Dominic’s table, he called out, "Ms. Lockhart, a moment?"

She paused, turning to face him.

Dominic offered an apologetic smile. "Ethan’s emotional range is about as deep as a puddle. He doesn’t know how to express himself, so don’t take his behavior personally."

Vivian shrugged. "Doesn’t matter. We’re nothing to each other now. He can do whatever he wants."

Dominic sighed but didn’t argue. Instead, he pulled an invitation from his bag. "Olivia and I are getting married tomorrow. I meant to have Ethan deliver this, but… well. I’d rather give it to you myself. Hope you’ll come."

Vivian blinked in surprise. She and Dominic had only met a handful of times—why invite her to something so private?

Then again, the Harringtons were political royalty. Staying on their good side could only benefit the Lockhart family.

She took the invitation with a grin. "Thanks. I’ll be there in style."

Once she left, Dominic grabbed Julian. "Kid, explain yourself. Why are you so cozy with your ex-aunt?"

Julian smirked. "Ex being the key word. She’s fair game now."

"Don’t play dumb. Your uncle’s serious this time," Dominic warned.

"Could’ve fooled me." Julian’s arrogance mirrored Ethan’s perfectly. "I gave him a chance. He blew it. Can’t blame me for stepping up now."

In all his years of reckless living, Julian had met countless people—but none as intriguing as Vivian.

He wasn’t sure if it was love, but he was definitely interested.
###Chapter 234

Ethan's icy gaze locked onto Cassandra. He remained silent.

Cassandra instantly knew she'd crossed a line. "I'm sorry, that was inappropriate," she stammered, hands trembling. "But I could be useful to you. May I have your number?"

For someone who'd always played it safe, this was wildly out of character.

Her nervous demeanor reminded Ethan of Vivian when they first met. Against his better judgment, he held out his hand. "Phone."

"Y-Yes!" Cassandra fumbled to hand it over.

Standing close by the taxi, they looked intimate to any passerby.

At that exact moment, Vivian and Liam exited the building.

Vivian's chest tightened. She wanted to turn away, but fate intervened—Ethan glanced up. Their eyes met.

His expression remained unreadable, but that infuriating arrogance still radiated off him. No guilt. No shame.

On impulse, Vivian looped her arm through Liam's. "How about that seaside hotel we visited last time?" she purred. "I'd love to go back."

Liam froze. If she was serious, their strictly professional relationship was about to implode.

Ethan's jaw clenched. He yanked the taxi door open. "Take us to The Grand Marquis," he ordered the driver.

The car sped past Vivian, leaving her staring after it.

Liam hesitated. "Boss... there actually is a nice beachfront hotel nearby—"

"No." Vivian pulled away, forcing a smile. "This is the last time I let him hurt me. Once Victoria wins the case, I'm leaving for good."

Night had fallen. Though Liam and Sophia offered to drive her home, Vivian refused. She needed space. Somewhere quiet to unravel.

The thought of Ethan with that girl made breathing painful. Like a knife twisting in her ribs.

Four years of marriage, and he'd never wanted her. Yet he'd fallen for a cheap imitation at first glance.

Life wasn't fair.

Her feet carried her to The Grand Plaza—the same mall she'd visited with Ethan and Isabella days ago. By sheer chance, the midnight showing of Soul Wanderer still had seats.

Vivian bought a ticket and slipped into the nearly empty theater.

In the darkness, surrounded by strangers, she finally felt safe enough to break.
###Chapter 235

The film told the story of a struggling pianist who died unexpectedly just as his career was about to take off. His soul met Soul Number 22, a cynical spirit who despised earthly existence. Together, they embarked on a journey of mutual healing and self-discovery.

The theater screen glowed softly with vibrant animation. The visuals were stunning, the narrative deeply moving.

As the story unfolded, Vivian found tears streaming down her cheeks. It wasn't the plot that affected her so deeply, nor was it any lingering pain from Ethan's actions. The emotions simply overwhelmed her without warning.

From what she'd read, pregnancy hormones could make women unusually sensitive. Mood swings were common during this phase. Vivian decided to embrace this moment of vulnerability, allowing herself to sob freely.

Her hands instinctively cradled her growing belly. "Just a little longer, my darlings. We'll be free soon."

The emotional release left her feeling lighter. Her spirits lifted noticeably as the credits began to roll.

Lights flooded the theater as audience members stood to leave. That's when Vivian spotted him - Ethan Blackwood, rising from a seat several rows ahead.

Her breath caught. Wasn't he supposed to be entertaining some college girl at a hotel? What was he doing here?

Vivian quickly turned away, hoping to avoid detection. But fate had other plans.

As Ethan reached the aisle, he turned abruptly. Their eyes locked in an electric moment of recognition. Neither looked particularly surprised, yet both wore expressions of someone caught in an awkward lie.

"You..." Ethan cleared his throat, adopting his usual detached tone. "I thought you were at the beach with your boyfriend. What brings you here?"

Vivian's mind raced. "Who goes to the beach at night? We rescheduled."

Her counter came swiftly. "And you? Shouldn't you be... occupied with your college companion?"

"Too late. We postponed too." Ethan rubbed his nose, avoiding direct eye contact.

Vivian nearly called out his pathetic excuse but held back. Hers hadn't been any more convincing.

They maintained this unspoken truce as the theater emptied, walking several paces apart yet strangely in sync. The tension between them had shifted, replaced by something more complex.

Outside the cinema, the night air felt charged with possibility.

Ethan checked his watch. "It's still early. Hungry?"

Vivian blinked in confusion. First he claimed it was too late for his date, now suddenly it was early?

This man was definitely up to something.
###Chapter 236

Ethan's lips thinned when Vivian remained silent. "Fine," he muttered coldly. "I've got other matters to attend to anyway."

"No! I'm available!" The words tumbled out before she could stop them.

Vivian immediately regretted her eagerness. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, cheeks flushing. "What I meant was... I do have a packed schedule, but I can spare time for supper..."

Amusement flickered in Ethan's eyes. He found her flustered state unexpectedly endearing.

They left the cinema and headed to a renowned night market famous for its street food stalls.

"What are you craving?" Ethan turned to face her.

"Anything works," Vivian replied. "Just nothing too salty."

Ethan's brow furrowed. "Since when do you avoid salty foods? I remember you loving them."

Vivian couldn't exactly admit her pregnancy diet restrictions. She shrugged. "People change. If someone can swap partners, why not taste preferences?"

Her words carried a subtle jab at their past.

Ethan ignored the implication, gesturing to a cozy-looking bistro. "How about minestrone soup? Light on salt and easy to digest."

"Sounds perfect."

The evening breeze made warm soup particularly appealing.

They chose a window table, the silence between them growing increasingly awkward.

"Want anything else?" Ethan finally asked. "Maybe bubble tea?"

Vivian shook her head. "The soup's enough. Too many liquids might upset my stomach."

"Right."

Another stretch of quiet. They resembled nervous teenagers on a first date rather than ex-spouses.

Vivian never imagined sharing a civil meal with Ethan. Stranger still was his sudden thoughtfulness - behavior she'd longed for during their marriage but only received after divorce.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

"Your minestrone soup!" A cheerful waiter arrived with steaming bowls. "Fresh vegetables, handmade pasta - guaranteed to warm your soul! Feel free to order seconds!"

His enthusiasm eased the tension.

Lifting the lids released aromatic steam. The waiter placed the bowls before them with a smile. "Enjoy! You won't regret it."

Vivian took a tentative sip, then her eyes widened. "Oh! This is incredible!" She practically gulped the soup.

Ethan found it mediocre at best. But watching Vivian's delight, he kept his opinion to himself.

Somehow, over simple soup, they found momentary connection.
###Chapter 237

Ethan Blackwood studied Vivian Lockhart over the rim of his glass. "So," he began, voice casual, "what are your plans?"

Vivian took another sip of soup before glancing up. "Plans for what?"

"You can't seriously stay in the business world forever," Ethan said, his tone edged with something unreadable. "It's ruthless. Dangerous. You won't last."

He knew firsthand the brutal realities of the industry. The backstabbing, the betrayals, the sleepless nights. And Vivian—sharp as she was—was still just a woman in a man’s game. Even divorced, he didn’t want that life for her.

Vivian arched a brow, a smirk playing on her lips. "Who says I can't handle it? Look at me now. Lockhart Enterprises is barely six months old, and we’ve already landed Kingsley Holdings. I’m president of the Tech Innovators Alliance. Everything’s going perfectly. So forgive me if I don’t see the danger you’re so worried about."

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "You’re being naive." His voice dropped, low and urgent. "Kingsley Holdings is a ticking time bomb. Leonard Kingsley might be throwing money at you now, but wait until it’s time to collect. You’ll see exactly how ruthless he is."

He leaned forward, eyes dark. "And that alliance presidency? Handed to you overnight. People resent that. Power like that comes with enemies. Walk away before it’s too late."

Every word was steeped in his own scars—lessons carved in blood and loss.

Vivian scoffed. "How generous of you, Mr. Blackwood. But I don’t need your charity. Or your protection."

"That’s not what I—"

"Then what?" she challenged.

Ethan exhaled sharply, his fingers curling into fists. "Do you even remember how your parents died? How the Lockharts fell? You think you’re stronger than them? Stronger than me?"

His voice cracked. "My brother died in front of me. I watched him take his last breath. Couldn’t do a damn thing to stop it."

The raw pain in his words made Vivian falter. For the first time, she saw past the cold CEO to the man beneath—broken, haunted.

She swallowed. "Ethan… you don’t have to worry about me."

A pause. Then, softer: "I never planned to stay in this world anyway. It’s exhausting. Once I’ve secured what I need, I’m gone."

"Gone?" His gaze snapped to hers. "Where?"

"That’s my business." She shrugged. "But I won’t be in Newport City anymore."

The words hung between them. Ethan’s expression shuttered. "If running makes you happy," he said icily, "then go."

He had no right to ask her to stay.

The rest of the meal passed in rare peace—no barbs, no bitterness. Just two people who’d once meant everything to each other, talking like old friends.

As they stood to leave, Vivian suddenly swayed. The world tilted. Her vision swam with fragmented images—flashes of something wrong.

Her hand shot out, gripping Ethan’s arm. Her voice was a whisper, urgent.

"Ethan. Wait."
###Chapter 238

Ethan's gaze dropped to the small hands clutching his arm, his eyes narrowing. "What's wrong?"

"People! So many people!" Vivian's head whipped around frantically before she attempted to drag Ethan into the car's backseat.

She kept squeezing closer, muttering under her breath. "There's too many of them! They're coming for us! Oh god, this is terrifying—we need to hide in here!"

"Many people?" Ethan scanned their surroundings, confusion etching his features. It was past midnight when they'd left, making them the only souls in the deserted parking lot.

'What is she talking about?'

"Stop arguing! They're right behind us!" Vivian's face flushed crimson with panic. "Don't you want to live? Get in now!"

With surprising strength, she yanked him inside before he could protest.

Relenting, Ethan allowed himself to be pulled into the spacious leather seats of the luxury coupe. The supple upholstery molded comfortably around them—at least their hiding spot was plush.

"So—" Ethan began.

"Shh!" Vivian clamped a hand over his mouth, her wide eyes darting to the tinted windows. "Keep your voice down!" she hissed. "They're circling the car. If they hear us..."

Ethan's bewilderment grew. No figures moved in the empty lot. No shadows lurked beyond the glass.

'Is this some bizarre flirtation tactic?' he wondered. Their current position was... suggestive.

Vivian had straddled his lap in her urgency to silence him. The thin fabric of their clothes did little to mask the heat between them.

Her floral perfume invaded his senses. The warm puffs of her breath against his neck sent shivers down his spine. It felt like tiny claws were kneading his racing heart.

'Damn this woman.'

"Ahem." Ethan's breathing turned ragged. He roughly pried her hands away, his darkened eyes locking onto hers.

"What game are you playing, Isabella Lockhart?" His voice emerged as a gravelly growl.

"I told you to be quiet!" Vivian's expression remained deadly serious, her luminous eyes pleading. "I may despise you, but I don't want you dead. Those creatures outside—they're armed with spears! We're outnumbered."

'Still keeping up the act?' Ethan arched a brow. 'Fine. I'll play along.'

In one swift motion, his large hands encircled her waist, hauling her flush against him. He cradled her face, his voice dropping to a dangerous purr. "If this is your idea of seduction, congratulations—it's working."

Hunger darkened his gaze, the intensity threatening to consume her.

"We were married, yet never truly... acquainted." His lips brushed her earlobe. "Shall we remedy that tonight?"

As he leaned in, expecting surrender, Vivian's bloodcurdling scream shattered the moment.

"AH! They're inside! The tiny people—they're crawling all over you!"

"Enough!"
###Chapter 239

Ethan's eyes snapped open. "Do you think this is amusing?" he growled at Vivian.

Vivian's fingers trembled as she pointed at his hair. "I'm serious! There are tiny people crawling all over you—look, they're in your hair now!"

Her voice pitched higher. "And weeds! So many weeds sprouting from your scalp. Let me pull them out!"

Before he could protest, her fingers tangled in his dark strands. "One... two... three..." she counted softly, plucking imaginary foliage.

Ethan exhaled sharply. This was absurd. His anger dissolved into weary resignation. Slumping against the leather seat, he let her continue, indulging her like one would a child lost in make-believe.

Fine. Play your little game. Let's see how long this charade lasts.

The car's interior held an odd intimacy—Vivian focused on her task, Ethan motionless beneath her touch. Strange, yet unexpectedly tender.

"Done!" Vivian finally declared, cupping his stubbled cheeks.

Ethan blinked awake, arching a brow. "What now?"

"Jelly!" She tapped his mouth. "Pink jelly. I want some!"

His breath hitched as her lips crashed against his. Frozen, he barely registered the sweet pressure before she nipped at his bottom lip.

"Mmm... so soft," she murmured between kisses, treating him like a confection.

Ethan's mind short-circuited. Never had she initiated contact like this—clumsy but fervent, as if truly believing his mouth was dessert.

A groan escaped him when she sucked too hard. "Idiot," he rasped, threading fingers through her hair. "This is how you kiss."

His mouth slanted over hers, slow and deliberate. Vivian stilled, then melted into the rhythm he set.

Minutes later, Ethan's vision swam. Tiny figures danced at the edges of his sight. He broke away abruptly. "Don't move. Those... creatures are on you too."

Vivian beamed. "See? I told you!"

They spent the next hour swatting at invisible pests until exhaustion claimed them, limbs tangled in sleep.

Dawn light stabbed Vivian's eyes. Her stomach lurched at the weight around her waist—Ethan's arm, possessive even in slumber. Her dress lay crumpled on the floor.

A scream tore from her throat. She was down to her lace underwear.
###Chapter 240

Ethan's eyes snapped open at Vivian's shrill scream. He sat up abruptly, his forehead creased in irritation.

The man had apparently removed his shirt during the night. His bronzed torso was on full display, every sculpted muscle a testament to his perfection. It was as though the universe had poured all its creative energy into crafting this one flawless specimen.

The intimate position they were in shocked him into instant alertness. He sat up straight, piercing gaze locked onto Vivian. "What's happening?"

"You disgusting pig! Don't pretend you don't know!" Vivian yanked a jacket over herself and punched Ethan's arm hard.

"You absolute monster! How could you do this to me? Look at my stomach! If anything's wrong, I swear I'll drag you straight to hell!" Though her memory of last night was fuzzy, the evidence seemed undeniable. A half-naked man and woman tangled together? What else could have happened?

"Wait." Ethan caught her flailing fists, struggling to piece together the events. "I can swear on my life I didn't touch you. I have standards, you know."

His body would have remembered such an encounter. In fact, his memory was crystal clear about last night's absurdity.

Vivian had behaved like someone possessed. She'd tried catching imaginary "tiny people," yanked his hair thinking it was weeds, and sucked on his lips like they were candy. The whole thing had been... bizarre.

"You're the one who needs to explain. If you wanted me, you could've just said so. No need for these theatrics." Ethan pulled her closer, his gaze razor-sharp.

"Me? Want you?" Vivian scoffed. "Keep dreaming. I'd have to be blind to desire someone like you."

"You threw yourself at me, then attacked my mouth like a vacuum cleaner. That's textbook seduction."

"That's impossible!" Vivian crossed her arms defiantly. "I'm not crazy enough to do that! I'd rather kiss a pig than you!"

"Fine." Ethan nodded. "Since you refuse to admit it, let's settle this with evidence."

"Show me your so-called proof then! Stop slandering me!" Vivian's voice shook with anger. Though her memory was blank, she knew she wasn't that kind of woman.

Ethan wordlessly exited the car and returned to the driver's seat.

Vivian misinterpreted his silence. "Think you can walk away after insulting me? I'll sue you for defamation!"

Instead of responding, Ethan pulled up the dashcam footage on the large screen...

"Oh god!" Vivian's face burned crimson as she covered her eyes. "Turn it off! This is mortifying!"

Never could she have imagined herself willingly "seducing" Ethan. Watching her brazenly maul his lips and grope him was unbearable.

Truthfully, Ethan did appear to be the victim here.

The footage showed them both eventually behaving identically - hunting invisible creatures and plucking "weeds" from each other's hair. Their intense focus led to accidental disrobing before exhaustion claimed them.

When the torture finally ended, Ethan coolly switched off the display.

Vivian had curled into a ball, wishing she could bury her head like an ostrich. Facing Ethan was impossible now.

"This is so humiliating! Just kill me now, I can't live with this!" she wailed childishly.

Oddly, Ethan found her distress endearing. A faint smile touched his lips. "So... how do you plan to take responsibility for this?"
###Chapter 241

Ethan's expression remained completely unreadable.

"I'm so sorry, I must have been out of my mind last night." Vivian's cheeks burned crimson as she avoided his gaze. Her voice barely rose above a whisper. "I have no explanation for my behavior..."

She took a shaky breath. "Let's pretend this never happened. I'll compensate you financially if you delete that recording. Deal?"

Ethan's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "Do I look like someone who needs your money?"

"Obviously not!"

"Then drop that ridiculous idea." His fingers tapped against his phone screen meaningfully. "Focus on finding other ways to make this up to me. Otherwise, this footage stays right where it is."

Vivian sat up abruptly, eyes flashing. "What else could you possibly want? Don't push your luck!"

She grabbed her own phone with trembling hands. "For your information, I have a video of your drunken antics too! Leak mine, and I'll release yours. We'll go down together!"

Ethan studied her for a long moment before shrugging. They dressed in tense silence, both pretending last night's events hadn't happened.

Vivian ran fingers through her tangled hair. "Seriously though... what came over me? I'd never act like that normally."

Ethan adjusted his cufflinks. "The soup."

"The what?"

"That minestrone contained hallucinogenic mushrooms in large quantities. You ate three bowls." His mouth twitched. "Explains the imaginary tiny people... the floating weed... the talking jelly."

Vivian frowned. "But you had some too! You seemed fine."

"Two spoonfuls versus your three bowls." He arched an eyebrow. "Though I did start seeing things toward the end."

"Why's that?"

Ethan gave her a look that made her stomach flip. "That kiss lasted too long."

Vivian buried her face in her hands with a groan. If the car floor could swallow her whole, she'd welcome it.

As the engine purred to life, scenery blurred past the windows. Ethan's eyes met hers in the rearview mirror. "About what you said earlier..."

"Hmm?"

"That comment about your stomach." His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "What did you mean by that?"

Vivian's throat went dry. "Oh! That!" She forced a laugh. "Look at me! I've gained so much weight. How could you still find this attractive?"

Ethan exhaled sharply, shoulders relaxing. "Is that all?" For a moment, he'd feared something far more serious - especially after those paparazzi shots of her visiting a gynecologist with Liam.

"You have put on some weight," he remarked casually. "Might want to cut back on desserts."

"Excuse me?" Vivian huffed, but couldn't argue. She crossed her arms and glared out the window.

The unfamiliar landscape finally registered. She spun toward Ethan. "Where exactly are you taking me?"
###Chapter 242

Ethan kept his silence, his lips pressed into a thin line as he concentrated on the road ahead.

The luxury car rolled smoothly onto the coastal highway, the endless expanse of the ocean stretching out on either side.

The sunlight danced on the water, creating a scene so picturesque it could have been lifted from a postcard.

Yet Vivian felt anything but relaxed. Her muscles tensed as she gripped the seat. Why is he taking me to the ocean? Is this about last night? Does he plan to drown me as payback for biting his lip?

"Ethan, let's be rational here," she said, her voice unnaturally high. "Extreme measures aren't necessary."

"I know I crossed a line, but it wasn't intentional! You were the one parading around half-dressed like some kind of temptation incarnate!"

"Honestly, you looked like you stepped out of a romance novel! Any woman would've made the same mistake! Just let it go this once!"

"I swear it'll never happen again! Even if you try to seduce me, I won't so much as nibble!"

Ethan's sculpted features remained impassive until her words drew a low chuckle from him. "So by your logic, I could bite you whenever I please if I consider you... appetizing? And face no consequences?"

"Absolutely not!" Vivian countered indignantly. "Mine was an accident! Yours would be premeditated! That makes you the criminal and me the victim!"

Ethan shook his head, marveling at her twisted reasoning. The woman could debate circles around anything when it suited her.

Their verbal sparring continued until the car approached Harborview City's most iconic landmark - the Cathedral of Tides. Perched on an island in the bay, its white spires and azure domes gleamed against the horizon, a vision of maritime elegance.

Normally closed to the public, this venue only hosted weddings for the elite. Legend claimed couples exchanging vows at sunset received the ocean's eternal blessing - their love bound as permanently as the tides.

The car halted in the VIP lot. Ethan exited smoothly, glancing back when Vivian didn't follow. She stood frozen, staring at the cathedral with shadowed eyes.

"Coming?" he prompted.

"You go ahead." Her voice turned hollow. "We're divorced, remember? Showing up together would raise unnecessary speculation."

The realization struck her sharply - one night of accidental intimacy couldn't bridge the chasm between them. She'd once dreamed of marrying here at sunset, exchanging rings beneath the stained glass.

Instead, the Blackwoods had orchestrated a lavish five-star affair that fulfilled every social expectation except hers. To the world, she'd been nothing more than a gold-digging prop in their dynastic play.

Never again would she be that ignored bride. Maintaining distance was the only sane choice.

"Reputation?" Ethan's eyebrow arched. A bitter laugh escaped him. "Fine. Have it your way."

Inside, the cathedral dazzled with thousands of blush roses lining the aisle. The Harringtons commanded significant influence, and Newport City's elite had turned out in force - power players who made celebrities seem pedestrian by comparison.
###Chapter 243

"Oh my God, Ethan! Where the hell have you been?" Nathan Prescott practically shouted the moment Ethan Blackwood stepped into the church. "Dominic was about to deploy his private security team to track you down!"

Nathan looked impeccable in his tailored tuxedo, hair perfectly styled.

Ethan remained unfazed. "The ceremony isn't until evening. Why the urgency?"

"Urgency?" Nathan grabbed Ethan's arm and dragged him toward the back. "We're the groomsmen, you idiot! We have to greet the bride, take photos—there's a whole schedule!"

He shoved Ethan toward the dressing room. "And change out of that casual mess. You look like you're here for brunch, not a wedding."

Inside, Dominic Harrington stood by the window, his white suit accentuating his striking features. The soft makeup made him look every bit the fairytale prince—except for the frown marring his expression.

He didn’t look like a man about to marry the love of his life. More like someone attending a funeral.

"Dom! Ethan's here!" Nathan announced, grinning.

Dominic turned, relief flashing in his eyes. "Thank God. I thought you weren’t coming."

Ethan arched a brow. "Why wouldn’t I?"

Dominic hesitated. "Given the history between you, me, and Olivia… I wouldn’t blame you if you skipped this."

Ethan’s voice was steady. "That’s in the past. Olivia and I are just friends now. I’m happy for you both."

Dominic exhaled.

For years, he and Olivia had avoided Ethan, convinced their relationship had destroyed him—that his marriage to Vivian Lockhart had been nothing but self-sabotage.

The guilt had eaten at them.

"I don’t think things are as simple between you and Vivian," Dominic said carefully. "Divorce or not, I have a feeling fate isn’t done with you two."

Then, glancing toward the door, he asked, "Did Vivian come with you? I sent her an invitation."

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "We’re not attached at the hip."

If she wants to avoid me, fine. I won’t force her into my orbit.

Nathan and Dominic exchanged a look. Clearly, Ethan wasn’t winning Vivian back anytime soon.

"Alright, enough chitchat," Nathan cut in. "You need to change, and we need to fetch the bride. Clock’s ticking."

Though usually carefree, Nathan took anything involving Olivia seriously. He’d been in love with her for years—making him the real martyr at this wedding.

After a quick wardrobe change, they headed out—only to nearly collide with Vivian at the church entrance.

Alone.

Dominic smiled warmly. "Vivian, you’re just in time. Want to join us to pick up the bride?"
###Chapter 244

Vivian had been circling the dessert table for what felt like hours when her stomach growled loudly.

She realized she hadn't eaten anything since breakfast.

Now she was devouring a chocolate mousse cake like a contestant in a speed-eating challenge. A smear of whipped cream decorated the corner of her lips, giving her an unexpectedly cute appearance.

The sudden sound of her name made her jerk her head up. Her eyes locked with Ethan's intense gaze as he loomed over her.

Mortified by her messy state, she quickly wiped her mouth and straightened her posture. "The staff insisted I try this. I wasn't actually that hungry—"

Dominic chuckled, clearly amused by her antics. "Our employees take their hospitality seriously. Don't worry, we hired Michelin-star pastry chefs. Every ingredient is calorie-controlled."

Ethan kept his hands in his pockets, his expression unreadable. "Now I understand why your waistline has expanded."

Vivian's grip tightened around her fork. She fantasized about smashing the entire cake into his smug face.

'That infuriating man! Can't he ever say anything nice?'

But the new Vivian didn't back down from challenges.

"Oh? Coming from someone whose six-pack looks suspiciously artificial. Tell me, Mr. Blackwood, how many cosmetic procedures did those abs require?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm.

"You should know better than anyone." His lips quirked. "Considering how often your hands wandered."

Heat flooded her cheeks. 'Damn it, he's right. Those rock-hard abs were definitely real... and spectacular.'

Nathan's head swiveled between them. "Wait—how would you know what his body looks like? Did something happen last—"

"NO!" Their simultaneous denial only deepened the suspicion.

Dominic's grin widened. 'Seems like last night was... eventful. Maybe Ethan finally got his act together.' The thought eased his lingering guilt.

"We're wasting time," Dominic announced, clapping his hands. "The wedding won't start without us."

Nathan nodded eagerly. "Right! Today's about you and Olivia. Save the foreplay for later—we've got a schedule!"

Dominic pointed to the waiting limousine. "We're all riding together. Nathan, you're driving."

"What? We have a chauffeur for—" Nathan's protest died as comprehension dawned. "Actually, I'm an excellent driver. Everyone in!"

Within minutes, Dominic and Nathan occupied the front seats, forcing Vivian and Ethan into the back.

Vivian grabbed a cupcake from the tray, avoiding eye contact. "I shouldn't intrude. We're not exactly close."

Truthfully, she'd rather stay and sample every dessert—Dominic's pastry team was extraordinary. Sitting through an awkward car ride with Ethan sounded like torture.

Dominic waved off her concern. "You're close enough with Ethan. That makes you family."

The engine roared to life as Vivian stared mournfully at the retreating dessert table. This would be a long ride.
###Chapter 245

Nathaniel's enthusiasm in inviting the woman was palpable.

Vivian hesitated internally. It's his special day. Ruining his mood would be cruel.

She finally nodded. "Alright then!"

Her gaze drifted longingly toward the exquisite desserts arranged on silver trays. She swallowed hard.

Farewell, my sweet treasures. I'll return for you—this I swear!

Ethan caught this fleeting moment, the corner of his mouth quirking upward.

"Wait." Ethan stopped Nathan, who was starting the engine.

"What now, Nate? Don't tell me you're suddenly shy around your ex-wife?" Nathan teased.

"Just hungry." Ethan replied curtly, striding toward the garden's dessert display.

Moments later, he returned with a tray overflowing with treats—milkshakes, éclairs, chocolate mousse, strawberry tarts.

Dominic and Nathan stared, jaws slack.

Nathan smirked. "Since when do you eat sweets, Ethan? This is new."

Ethan shot him a warning glare. "Eyes on the road."

Then, with feigned indifference, he offered the tray to Vivian beside him. "Help yourself."

Vivian's eyes sparkled. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! Don't mind if I do!"

She grabbed an éclair, biting into it with relish. The crisp shell gave way to velvety custard, flavors exploding on her tongue.

Initially intending to eat daintily, she soon abandoned decorum. Cream smeared her lips as she devoured the treats.

All three men watched, stunned—especially Nathan. He'd always seen Vivian as refined, almost boringly proper.

But since her divorce from Ethan, she'd become... fascinating.

"You're a foodie too? Another thing we share besides gaming!" Nathan chuckled, warming to her.

As a fellow food enthusiast, he knew such people were genuine at heart.

Ethan scoffed. "Common? Every young person likes games and food."

Missing Ethan's jealousy, Nathan argued, "You hate both. Does that make you old?"

Ethan's expression darkened. He shoved a cream puff at Dominic. "Shut him up."

Vivian, blissfully unaware, mumbled through a mouthful, "This is divine! Must bring some for Evelyn later."

Pregnancy had amplified her cravings. Each bite seemed to make the babies dance with joy.

Suddenly, Ethan muttered, "Better than my kisses?"

The car plunged into awkward silence.
###Chapter 246

The cream puff slipped from Vivian's fingers as her cheeks burned crimson. Is this man insane? What kind of ridiculous thing is he saying?!

Nathaniel remained composed, his gaze steady on her. "You said the exact same thing last night while biting my lip, remember?"

Nathan Prescott cleared his throat loudly. "Damn, Nate! In broad daylight? Control yourself!"

Dominic Harrington chuckled softly. "Sounds like things got pretty... intense between you two last night."

Nathaniel shrugged. "She was the wild one. I was just the victim."

"Nathaniel Blackwood!" Vivian shrieked, mortification flooding her. She wanted to vanish into thin air.

Denying it was pointless—not when he had concrete evidence. If this bastard releases that dashcam footage out of spite, I'm finished!

Ugh, whatever! I'm not wasting energy arguing with this infuriating man!

Closing her eyes, Vivian turned toward the window, feigning sleep. Exhaustion from last night must have caught up with her because, against her will, she drifted off.

As drowsiness claimed her, she felt strong arms adjusting her position. Her head landed on a firm shoulder—warm, solid, safe.

Nathaniel glanced down at the woman curled against him, an unfamiliar tenderness flickering in his eyes. He hadn’t even realized how much she’d come to mean to him.

A smudge of cream lingered at the corner of Vivian’s lips. Without her usual sharpness, she looked softer, almost delicate. His chest tightened inexplicably.

Pulling a handkerchief from his suit, he gently wiped the cream away, handling her like a priceless treasure.

Nathan whistled from the driver’s seat, catching the moment in the rearview mirror. "Damn, Nate. Last time, I had doubts. But now? You’re gone for her."

Nathaniel stiffened, abruptly withdrawing the handkerchief. "Don’t be absurd. I just hate mess."

"Mess?" Nathan grinned. "I’ve got cream on my face too. Wanna clean me up?"

Nathaniel shoved another cream puff at Dominic. "Shut him up."

Dominic chuckled but then sighed, his gaze lingering on the couple in the backseat. A shadow of longing crossed his face.

"Nate, it’s obvious Vivian means something to you. There’s no shame in admitting it."

"In fact... I envy you. Do you know how rare it is to find someone who truly matters to you—and have them feel the same?"

The words, coming from the groom himself, felt oddly heavy.

Nathaniel frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Dominic shook his head. "Nothing. Just thinking aloud. Love’s a privilege. When you find it, you should hold on tight."

Nathan smirked. "Why the hell are you jealous? You and Olivia are the definition of a love match."

Dominic only offered a bittersweet smile in return.

Soon, they arrived at the bride’s hotel.

Despite the Harringtons’ influence, the wedding was deliberately understated—no extravagant displays, just intimate traditions.

A series of challenges awaited the groom and his party, each designed to test devotion and intellect. Eighteen obstacles stood between Dominic and his bride.
###Chapter 247

The wedding challenges tested both intellect and physical prowess. Disciplines ranged from martial arts to mathematics, physics to philosophy.

Literature came first. The bridesmaids demanded a full recitation of Romeo and Juliet's famous balcony scene. A perfect choice for romance, they claimed.

The groom's party boasted Ivy League graduates and business tycoons. Yet all froze at the challenge.

"Who memorizes entire plays these days?" Nathan Prescott muttered, reaching for his wallet. "Eight thousand? Done."

Vivian Lockhart rose abruptly. "I'll do it."

Her clear voice filled the room as she flawlessly delivered Shakespeare's verses. The groomsmen gaped.

"Damn," Nathan whispered to Ethan Blackwood. "I thought she was bluffing."

Ethan smirked. "Told you she graduated summa cum laude."

Ten minutes later, thunderous applause erupted. The bridesmaids looked impressed. "The Lockharts clearly value education over empty status."

Vivian waved off the praise. "Just a hobby." Though privately, she questioned using a tragedy at a wedding.

Dominic Harrington's eyes shone with admiration. "Ms. Lockhart, you're incredible."

"Transfer the bribe money and we'll call it even," Vivian joked.

Dominic immediately pulled out his phone. The instant payment notification made Vivian grin. This wedding just got profitable.

Seventeen more challenges fell before Vivian's expertise. Her bank balance grew with each victory.

Then came the final test: persuading the bride to open the door. All attempts failed, even Dominic's heartfelt pleas.

Vivian shrugged. "This one's on you guys."

Nathan nudged Ethan. "Your turn, Blackwood."
###Chapter 248

All eyes turned to Nathaniel Blackwood, disbelief evident on every face. The complicated history between these three was practically public knowledge.

That Nathaniel even showed up at the wedding was shocking enough. Now he was participating in the reception games? People were starting to think he might be too forgiving for his own good.

Nathaniel pressed his lips into a thin line, standing rigidly silent. His body language screamed refusal.

The air grew thick with tension, the awkwardness almost palpable.

Seeing things were about to derail, Oliver Prescott started sweating bullets. "Nate, we know this is asking too much..."

"But we're out of options. Didn't Victoria say she feels guilty about what happened? She wants your blessing before she'll open that door. Just... give her this one thing?"

Dominic Harrington scowled. "Oliver, back off. Nate shouldn't have to do this at all!"

Before Oliver could argue, Nathaniel cut in sharply. "It's fine. If this is what it takes."

He stepped forward and knocked, his expression tight. "Victoria, open up. I've moved on. I genuinely wish you and Dom happiness."

A soft, trembling voice finally responded from behind the door. "Nate... Dom and I... we're so sorry. We've waited so long to hear you say that... Thank you..."

The door cracked open slightly.

The groomsmen immediately surged forward while the bridesmaids put up a spirited defense.

Original from N?velDrama.Org.

The room erupted into cheerful chaos once more.

Nathaniel stood apart from the crowd, his tall frame rigid as he observed the scene. The sadness in his eyes was unmistakable.

Isabella Lockhart had also positioned herself at the periphery for safety.

She stole a glance at Nathaniel and felt her heart clench at his devastated expression.

'Damn, this has to be killing him.'

'His first love ends up with his best friend, and now he has to play along? Poor Blackwood...'

'He never got over Sinclair, did he?'

'God, watching your soulmate marry someone else must be torture.'

As Dominic finally reached his bride, the crowd erupted in cheers.

"Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!"

Isabella glanced back at Nathaniel, noting how his jaw tightened further.

'This is pure agony for him.' She found herself moving toward him without thinking, slipping her hand into his.

Nathaniel startled, turning to her with utter confusion.

Isabella gave him a conspiratorial wink. "Don't thank me. Just repaying you for those macarons. Today, you won't look pathetic with me by your side."

His frown deepened. 'What the hell is she talking about?'

Seeing his bewilderment, Isabella rose on her toes to whisper, "I know you're still in love with Victoria. Watching her marry someone else must be hell." 'That forced congratulations? Brutal. No wonder you're miserable.'
###Chapter 249

The truth hit Ethan Blackwood like a ton of bricks.

He stood frozen, unsure how to respond.

How did she jump to the conclusion that I'm heartbroken?

Sure, I looked upset earlier, but it had nothing to do with Olivia.

His mind had been replaying his rushed, emotionless marriage to Vivian Lockhart. There wasn’t a single happy memory from that day—just cold formalities and empty vows.

Regret twisted inside him. He’d even fantasized about a do-over, a real wedding where he could cherish her properly.

But he’d never admit that. Instead, he smirked, playing along. "Yeah, I’m devastated. My pride’s shattered. What should I do?"

Vivian’s expression softened. She patted his shoulder. "The best revenge is living well. Find someone who makes you happier than they ever could."

Ethan sighed dramatically. "Easier said than done. My marriage failed spectacularly. Now everyone knows you’re running around with that Harrington guy. I’m the laughingstock of Newport City."

"Relax," Vivian said, lifting her chin. "I promised I’d fix this. Your reputation reflects on me too—I can’t have my ex looking pathetic."

Across the room, Olivia Sinclair watched them whisper, her smile brittle.

They’re divorced. It was messy. So why are they acting like this?

Her fingers dug into Dominic Harrington’s arm as she forced a sweet tone. "Ethan, don’t stand so far away! We’d love your blessing before the group photo."

The guests shifted uncomfortably.

Vivian raised her hand. "I’ll join too! Ethan and I are close. Wouldn’t miss this for the world."

Olivia’s grip tightened. "Isn’t it awkward? Exes in the same picture?"

Vivian smirked. "Divorce just upgraded our relationship. Where he goes, I go."

Olivia’s mask slipped. "This photo is special—just the three of us. For memories."

Ethan cut in coldly. "No need."

Her eyes welled up. "Do you still hate us? Is that why you’re doing this?"

Nathan Prescott leaned in, whispering urgently. "Olivia, not here."

Dominic, however, just smiled. "Let’s all take one together. More festive, right?"

Olivia bit her lip, defeated.

The photographer clapped his hands. "Newlyweds, get cozy! A kiss would make this unforgettable!"

But the couple stood stiffly, tension radiating between them.

Then—

Ethan cupped Vivian’s face.

Like this?

And kissed her deeply.
###Chapter 250

Gasps rippled through the crowd like wildfire.

Ethan Blackwood's bold move detonated like a nuclear bomb in everyone's minds.

The guests knew him as the ice-cold CEO who never showed emotion in public. A man who'd rather die than participate in some cheesy romantic display.

Yet here he was, kissing Vivian Lockhart with enough passion to melt glaciers.

Vivian's eyes flew wide open. Her mind short-circuited.

Every instinct screamed at her to shove him away. But she remembered their deal - she was supposed to play the doting girlfriend today.

'If I reject him now, it'll humiliate him in front of everyone.'

So she surrendered to the kiss, despite her initial resistance.

Ethan's burning intensity shattered her composure completely. Her cheeks flushed crimson as she found herself responding against her better judgment.

"Perfect! Just like that! More passion!" The photographer was practically drooling as he snapped away furiously.

The crowd watched, mesmerized. It was like watching the steamiest romance movie come to life right before their eyes.

Even Nathan Prescott, a self-proclaimed ladies' man, whistled appreciatively. "Damn, Ethan's got skills! Who knew Mr. Ice Cube could kiss like that? The bastard's been holding out on us!"

Dominic Harrington observed the scene with an unreadable smile, though jealousy laced his voice. "So this is what real chemistry looks like. About time Ethan figured it out."

The only person not enjoying the show was Olivia Sinclair.

Her fists clenched so tightly her manicured nails drew blood from her palms. No amount of deep breathing could contain her rage.

"ENOUGH!" Her shrill scream shattered the moment.

All heads swiveled toward the trembling bride.

Olivia forced a brittle smile, though her eyes burned with fury. "It's my wedding day, remember? Shouldn't Dominic and I be the center of attention?" Her voice dripped with fake sweetness. "We're just so... jealous of you two lovebirds."

Ethan finally released Vivian, though his smoldering gaze suggested he wasn't done. "You're right," he murmured, lips curling. "Some things are better saved for the bedroom."

"Since we've stolen your thunder," he continued smoothly, "we'll take our leave now. See you at the ceremony."

With that, he whisked a still-flustered Vivian away from the gawking crowd.

They emerged onto a stunning seaside terrace. The salty ocean breeze carried the scent of blooming jasmine.

Ethan inhaled deeply, as if breathing freely for the first time in years. He turned to Vivian. "We've got time before the ceremony. Walk with me on the beach?"

Vivian finally snapped out of her daze. She swatted his arm away playfully. "Well, Mr. Ex-Husband? How'd I do as your paid actress? Got your ego sufficiently stroked?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "Who said anything about paying you?"

"Weren't you?" Vivian arched a brow, all traces of her earlier shyness gone. "That whole performance was just to make Olivia jealous, wasn't it?"

She tapped her chin mock-thoughtfully. "Objectively speaking? I'd give that kiss a 9.5/10. Only deducting half a point so your head doesn't get too big."

Ethan scoffed. "You're so clever. Think you've got everything figured out, don't you?"

"Obviously!" Vivian tossed her hair, grinning. "You're still hung up on your precious first love. And she's clearly not over you either!" She leaned in conspiratorially. "Though I must admire her hustle - keeping both you and Dominic on her leash? Impressive."
###Chapter 251

"Is that so?" Nathaniel's lips curved into a conflicted smile. "What should I do, then? Should I storm the wedding and declare my love?"

Vivian's expression stiffened, a storm of emotions swirling in her chest. So he still hasn't gotten over Olivia Sinclair.

Her heart ached—for him, and for herself. Their four-year marriage had been doomed from the start. Even without Cassandra Delacroix's interference, she never stood a chance.

Olivia had already claimed every inch of his heart. There was no room left for her.

"If you really can't let her go, then talk to her before the ceremony," Vivian said, forcing her voice steady. "If you confess properly, she might reconsider." She pretended indifference, even offering advice like it didn't tear her apart.

"And if you love her, don’t play games. That kiss earlier? She was furious. You might’ve just pushed her away."

Nathaniel nodded solemnly. "You're right. Thanks for the insight."

"But—" His gaze drifted to the shoreline. "This beach is stunning at low tide. There are rare shells buried in the sand. Come with me. Help me find them."

"Me?"

"You're the only one who knows how I feel. I need your help." His tone carried its usual arrogance, as if her compliance was a given.

Vivian nearly scoffed. Do I look like your personal assistant?

Still, she agreed—on one condition.

"Fine. But it’ll cost you. Fifteen hundred dollars per minute. Hourly rate? Twenty percent discount. Payment upfront."

Nathaniel chuckled. This woman and her obsession with money.

With his fortune, indulging her was trivial. "Deal."

They headed to the beach opposite the hotel, where the water glittered like sapphires. The breeze carried salt and freedom, washing away tension.

Vivian spread her arms wide. "Hello, beautiful ocean!"

She adored the sea. The fact that she was getting paid to enjoy it made the moment even sweeter.

The sun blazed overhead, but the wind kept the heat at bay. Vivian danced along the shoreline, guilt gnawing at her. She glanced at Nathaniel and grinned.

"Don’t worry, boss. I heard there’s a legendary shell here—Ocean’s Heart. They say whoever finds it gets eternal happiness."

I’ll turn this whole beach upside down for you. Then you can win Olivia back with it.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Then you’d better find it. I could use a fresh start."
###Chapter 252

Vivian remained true to her professional ethics, diving into the seashell hunt with intense focus. Her brows furrowed in concentration as she combed through the golden sand.

Ethan lingered a few paces behind, his tall frame casting a protective shadow over her. The CEO who normally commanded boardrooms now played the role of silent guardian.

Their footprints intertwined along the shoreline, the ocean breeze carrying the scent of salt and sunshine. It could have been a scene from one of those romantic movies Vivian secretly enjoyed.

"Found it!" Vivian's triumphant shout shattered the peaceful moment. She emerged from behind a coral reef, waving something pink in her hand.

Ethan arched an eyebrow. The man who built his empire on logic and facts found himself staring at a supposedly magical seashell. 'This can't be real,' he thought.

Yet something stopped him from voicing his skepticism. Maybe it was the way Vivian's eyes sparkled brighter than the ocean, or how her smile outshone the midday sun.

"Look! The Ocean's Heart!" Vivian cradled the shell like sacred treasure, brushing away grains of sand. "See how perfectly heart-shaped it is? And that rare pink hue!"

Sunlight danced across the shell's iridescent surface, casting prismatic reflections that almost made Ethan believe in its legendary powers.

He cleared his throat. Part of him wanted to mention how common these were during his summers in Cornwall. But the words died in his throat when he saw her hopeful expression.

"It's... adequate," Ethan conceded, surprising himself with the uncharacteristic diplomacy.

This wasn't like him. The Blackwood heir never softened his words for anyone. Yet here he was, biting back sarcasm just to preserve Vivian's radiant joy.

His introspection was interrupted by the sudden shift in her demeanor. Professional Vivian snapped back into place as she pulled out her phone.

"One hour, thirty-seven minutes," she announced, fingers flying across the screen. "At our agreed rate, that comes to 116,400 dors. I'll be generous and round it down."

She flashed him a businesslike smile. "Worth every penny, don't you think? Propose with this, and she'll melt like butter."

Ethan's jaw tightened. 'Should've known better than to think she'd stay adorable.'

The woman was a mercenary disguised as a romantic. One moment playing the charming beachcomber, the next demanding payment with military precision.

As he turned to leave, Vivian grabbed his wrist. "Don't forget your purchase!" She pressed the shell into his palm with surprising gentleness. "This charm cost you a fortune. Make it count."

Ethan studied the pink shell, then the enigmatic woman who found it. He couldn't decide if she was mocking him or offering genuine advice. Both possibilities equally infuriated him.

The wedding venue buzzed with elite guests in designer attire, their champagne flutes catching the light. Dominic and the groomsmen had just arrived with the bride, signaling the ceremony's imminent start.

When Ethan and Vivian entered together, whispers rippled through the crowd like a sudden tide.

"I thought they were divorced? Why are they together? And why do they look so... cozy?"
###Chapter 253

Evelyn Sinclair, the famous actress, glared daggers at the pair. Her face twisted with barely concealed envy.

She had set her sights on Nathaniel Blackwood long before her acting career took off. Back then, she vowed to climb high enough to catch his attention—and eventually become his wife.

But before she could make her mark, he married someone else.

Years of waiting, hoping for his marriage to crumble, seemed wasted now.

"Who knows? All I know is my cousin despises her, so I bet she's the one clinging to him!" Charlotte sneered, shooting Vivian Lockhart a scornful look before patting Evelyn's shoulder.

"You're too reserved, Evelyn. Now that he's divorced, you should make your move! Do you have any idea how many women are after him? How can you stay so passive?"

Evelyn clenched her fists. "It's not that simple. My career is at its peak right now. My new film's about to premiere—I can't afford a scandal."

"But Nathaniel's single now! The public would adore you together. How is that a scandal?"

Charlotte sighed dramatically. "Just watch out for that witch, Vivian. Don't let her innocent act fool you. She's ruthless."

"Remember Cassandra Delacroix? When she was pregnant with Nathaniel's child, Vivian destroyed her. I avoid that woman like the plague."

Ever since Cassandra fell from grace, Charlotte had been searching for a suitable replacement in her social circle. Evelyn was her top choice.

A smug smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Please. Her tricks are amateur compared to what I've faced in Hollywood. I clawed my way up—do you really think I'd lose to her?"

To avoid further gossip, Vivian quickly stepped away from Nathaniel and headed straight for the dessert table. After their seashell hunt, she was starving.

Seeing her retreat, Nathaniel frowned but didn't stop her. Instead, he turned toward the backstage area to meet Dominic Harrington and the others.

A figure in white suddenly blocked his path—Olivia Sinclair, still in her wedding gown.

Nathaniel's expression cooled. "Why are you here?"

Olivia's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Nate, please... can we talk somewhere private?"

"Say it here." His tone left no room for argument.

"It has to be in private. I'm begging you. Otherwise, this wedding won't happen—"

Nathaniel hesitated. The Harrington wedding was packed with high-profile guests. A scandal would humiliate the family.

"Stop overthinking. Do this for Dominic. After we talk, I'll walk away for good."

Biting her lip, Olivia grabbed his arm and pulled him toward a nearby VIP room.

For the sake of appearances, Nathaniel reluctantly followed.

The moment the door shut, Olivia collapsed into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Nate, I regret everything! I never loved Dominic. It's always been you!"

"After we broke up, I dreamed of reuniting. I never thought you'd marry so soon. Thank God you're free now..."

Tears streamed down her face as she gazed up at him, voice trembling. "What if I said I want us to start over? Would you take me away from this wedding?"
###Chapter 254

"No." Ethan's response was immediate and final, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Olivia collapsed against him, her body shaking with sobs. She clung to him desperately, pressing her tear-streaked face against his, trying to recapture the intimacy they once shared.

"You're just afraid of hurting Dominic, aren't you?" Her voice cracked with desperation. "You're suppressing your feelings for me, right? You never stopped loving me! Admit it!"

"This has nothing to do with Dominic." Ethan's expression turned icy as he firmly pushed her away.

"Even if you weren't with him, there could never be anything between us. You need to accept that."

"Why?!" Olivia screamed, her voice raw with pain. The rejection was too much to bear.

"You loved me so much!" she cried. "I remember your confession under the cherry blossoms, your gentle kisses! That love was real!"

"You were willing to give up your inheritance for me! You nned to follow me abroad when I pursued my studies! How can you throw away a love that deep?!"

"I won't deny I loved you once," Ethan admitted, his voice steady. "That love was real, but it's in the past now. We both have people who matter to us now."

His words carried hidden meaning. He had truly loved Olivia once - so much that he'd mistaken those lingering feelings during his entire marriage.

Only after Vivian left him did he realize the love he truly missed wasn't for Olivia at all.

Now single, he understood he'd merely been nostalgic for the innocence of their youthful rtionship.

"Other people?" Olivia scoffed bitterly. "Who? Your precious Dominic?"

"You should know your perfect Dominic doesn't love me. He only sees me as a suitable political match for the Harringtons!"

"They're politicians - of course they need someone from an academic family like mine!"

"Honestly, he'd probably be relieved if I ran away before the wedding!"

Ethan frowned. He'd never noticed any problems between Dominic and Olivia.

They'd seemed perfectly happy together all these years.

"Dominic shows love through actions, not words," Ethan said gently. "Just because he's not expressive doesn't mean he doesn't care."

He placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Don't overthink this. He does love you."

"Stop pretending to care!" Olivia took a shuddering breath, her face twisted in pain. "You're rejecting me because there's someone else, isn't there?"

Ethan's lips pressed into a thin line, remaining silent.

Was there someone else? He wasn't sure.

Yet Vivian's face immediately came to mind.

'But That chapter is closed...'

"I understand. I've lost." Olivia managed a fragile smile, looking at him with heartbreaking tenderness.

"Miss Lockhart is remarkable. Anyone can see how much she loves you. I wish you both happiness. I concede defeat."

"It's alright. You should go now. If anyone sees us like this..."

"Really?"

"Really!"

"And the wedding?"

"The wedding will proceed as nned." Olivia straightened her shoulders, forcing another smile. "I'm not a child anymore. I just needed to get this off my chest."

"Dominic may not love me, but he treats me well. Many would envy my position. I'll learn to cherish him."

"Good."
###Chapter 255

Ethan gave a curt nod as he pushed open the door, Olivia Sinclair following closely behind him.

Their path was abruptly blocked by Vivian Lockhart clutching a slice of chocolate cake.

An awkward silence fell between them. Though Vivian had nothing to hide, heat crept up her neck under their combined gaze.

"Did I... interrupt something important?" she asked, shifting her weight uncomfortably.

Ethan's only response was that infuriatingly arrogant stare he reserved just for her.

Undeterred, Vivian pressed on. "So? Did the Ocean's Heart work? Are you two lovebirds making your grand escape now?"

His expression darkened visibly. Leaning down, he whispered something to Olivia before brushing past Vivian without another glance. The cold dismissal stung more than she cared to admit.

"That insufferable bastard!" Vivian muttered under her breath as she watched his retreating figure. "All I did was ask for my damn money back."

Exhaustion weighed heavy on her shoulders. She'd only wanted to find a quiet corner to rest after the day's chaos.

Running into their little rendezvous was the last thing she needed.

Though she'd been the one to encourage Ethan to steal the bride, seeing them together twisted something painful in her chest.

As she turned to leave, Olivia's voice stopped her. "Miss Lockhart, might I have a word?"

"Not interested," Vivian said flatly.

What could the perfect first love possibly have to say to the failed ex-wife?

Was this some pathetic attempt at gloating? She didn't have the energy for petty games.

"Please," Olivia pressed, her voice trembling slightly. "Just a moment. I need... closure."

Vivian sighed. There was something unbearably vulnerable in Olivia's eyes that made refusal impossible. "Fine. Make it quick."

"It's just... you mean more to Nathaniel than you realize." Olivia's hands twisted together. "I want him to be happy. When he loves, he loves completely. There was a time he—"

For ten agonizing minutes, Vivian endured the retelling of their epic romance. How Ethan had sacrificed everything. How he bore a scar from protecting Olivia that bound them forever.

"Enough!" Vivian finally cut in with a strained smile. "You should publish this tragic love story. Might make some decent pocket money."

Olivia's lips curved in satisfaction. "Are you jealous, Miss Lockhart?"

She thrust forward a delicate necklace. "This was our promise. I'm giving it to you now. Keep it or throw it away - it no longer matters to me. Consider it the end of our story."

Vivian recoiled, but Olivia forced the jewelry into her palm. Their struggle sent Olivia tumbling dramatically to the floor, the scene dripping with melodramatic despair.

Unbeknownst to them, every calculated move had been witnessed - and captured - by unseen eyes with their own agenda.
###Chapter 256

Vivian sighed in frustration before reluctantly taking the necklace.

She extended her hand to Olivia, who remained seated on the floor. Her tone was exasperated as she said, "Fine, I'll take it. But you did say I could do whatever I wanted with it, right? So I'm tossing it in the trash."

Olivia didn’t react with anger. Instead, she offered a bittersweet smile. "Go ahead. I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away anyway. Consider this you doing me a favor." She paused, then added softly, "Like I told Ethan earlier, if I had to lose to anyone, I’m glad it was you."

Vivian blinked in confusion.

What? Weren’t they planning to run away together? Why am I suddenly part of this? And what does she mean by ‘losing’ to me?

But she refused to pry further. Olivia was the bride—if she wanted to call off the wedding or go through with it, that was her choice.

She can figure it out herself. Asking too many questions will just make it seem like I care, and I don’t!

The sun dipped lower, casting the ocean and sky in a warm, fiery glow. The church’s floor-to-ceiling windows framed the breathtaking view, bathing the interior in golden light.

Just then, the ceremony bell chimed. The priest lifted his cross, signaling the start of the rituals as guests settled into their seats.

Excitement buzzed through the crowd, everyone eager to see the bride and groom.

Vivian, however, was convinced the seating planner had it out for her.

Why on earth would they put Nathaniel right next to me? Everyone knows we’re divorced!

To make matters worse, her longtime rival, Charlotte, sat on her left.

Am I being ambushed from both sides?

She glanced at the icy man beside her, then at her ex-cousin-in-law, who was radiating hostility.

Just as she considered moving, the priest announced the groom’s entrance, forcing her to stay put.

Dominic strode in, dressed in an immaculate white suit, a bouquet of crimson roses in hand. His steps were measured, regal, as he approached the altar.

The women in the audience erupted into cheers, their admiration bordering on worship.

"Oh my god, Dominic is perfection!"

Even Vivian caught herself leaning forward, her pulse quickening.

Damn. A bouquet, this sunset, and a man like that waiting for his bride? This wedding is straight out of a fairy tale.

Then Nathaniel shot her a sharp glare, despite having ignored her all evening. His voice was low but biting. "Why are you so invested in someone else’s wedding?"

He hadn’t whispered, and the nearby guests definitely heard.

Heat rushed to Vivian’s cheeks. She clenched her fists. "What’s your problem, Mr. Blackwood? Can’t I appreciate a nice moment? If it bothers you so much, why don’t you go up there and challenge him? Let’s see who the bride would choose!"

"Don’t be ridiculous," Nathaniel snapped, turning away with a scowl.

Vivian huffed. "Look at you, all worked up. I’m just stating facts!"

He’s too cowardly to steal the bride, so he takes it out on me instead. Typical.

The priest, clad in black robes, raised his vow book. "The groom has arrived. Now, let us welcome the bride!"

Solemn music swelled. The guests turned expectantly toward the entrance.

But when the music faded, the bride was nowhere in sight.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"What’s going on? Where’s the bride? Is this some kind of test?"
###Chapter 257

The murmurs spread like wildfire through the grand ballroom.

The flustered priest cleared his throat. "True love withstands all trials. Let's welcome the bride again!"

Music swelled through the venue once more. When it faded, Olivia Sinclair remained conspicuously absent.

Both families descended into panic. Staff scrambled in every direction while guests exchanged speculative glances. The meticulously planned event dissolved into bedlam.

Vivian Lockhart nudged Ethan Blackwood's arm. "Did you orchestrate this?" she whispered. "Where did you stash her?"

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "Careful, or you'll lose that sharp tongue of yours."

Vivian pressed her lips together. 'Touchy much? Someone's defensive.'

Nathan Prescott moved through the crowd like a man possessed. "Remain calm, everyone! Dominic and Olivia are soulmates—this must be part of their grand romantic gesture!"

The longtime admirer had dedicated months to perfecting this wedding. His devotion to Olivia bordered on religious fervor.

Dominic Harrington stood motionless at the altar, his expression unreadable. The groom's eerie composure contrasted sharply with the surrounding chaos.

"Miss Sinclair has vanished!" A staff member burst in breathlessly. "Only her wedding gown remains in the bridal suite!"

Nathan seized the messenger's collar. "Lies! Olivia would never abandon her own wedding!"

"See for yourself!" the employee gasped.

Nathan whirled toward Dominic. "This is another test! Help me find her!"

Dominic remained rooted in place. "She's made her choice clear. I won't force her hand."

"Have you lost your mind? After everything you've endured together?" Nathan's voice cracked.

Dominic merely shrugged. "She's a grown woman capable of her own decisions."

Turning to the murmuring crowd, Dominic projected his voice. "The bride has evidently reconsidered. Please accept the Harrington family's deepest apologies. Consider this an impromptu celebration—enjoy the hospitality."

The Harringtons bowed stiffly, their humiliation palpable beneath practiced smiles.

Just as the tension began to dissipate, a voice cut through the crowd. "This wasn't Olivia's choice! Someone took her!"
###Chapter 258

Gasps rippled through the crowd as all eyes turned toward the speaker. It was Evelyn Sinclair, last year's Academy Award winner for Best Actress.

She had been seated discreetly beside Margaret Whitmore, placing her in the same row as Ethan Blackwood and Vivian Lockhart.

Throughout the evening, Evelyn had maintained perfect composure, quietly observing their interactions from the shadows.

To the untrained eye, Ethan and Vivian appeared to be bitter rivals. But Evelyn's sharp instincts detected something far more intriguing beneath their barbed exchanges - an undeniable chemistry that bordered on flirtation.

The realization sent waves of jealousy crashing through her, fueling her resolve to destroy Vivian at any cost.

Nathan Prescott rushed forward urgently. "What are you implying? Do you know where the bride is?"

"Not exactly," Evelyn replied with calculated hesitation. "But I have strong suspicions about who might be responsible..."

With practiced precision, she let her gaze flicker nervously toward Vivian, her Oscar-winning performance making it seem like she feared retaliation for speaking out.

The transparent manipulation worked instantly. Every head in the room swiveled toward Vivian.

Caught off guard, Vivian blinked in confusion. "What? Why is everyone staring at me? I don't know anything about this!"

"Stop pretending, Miss Lockhart," Evelyn countered smoothly. "I have photographic evidence of your altercation with Miss Sinclair earlier."

The revelation sent the room into chaos.

Nathan's face darkened. "Show us these photos immediately! Every second counts - if Olivia's in danger, we might still save her!"

Internally, he thought: 'I knew it. Something terrible must have happened to her.'

Vivian's temper flared at the baseless accusation, but her voice remained ice-cold. "By all means, present your evidence. But be warned - if your so-called proof fails to implicate me, or if this is a deliberate attempt at defamation, I will sue you into oblivion."

A flicker of uncertainty crossed Evelyn's face. She hadn't anticipated such fierce resistance from a supposed social pariah.

'Margaret wasn't exaggerating - this woman is dangerous.'

But years in Hollywood had honed her skills. With dramatic flair, she produced her phone. "While passing the bridal suite earlier, I witnessed Miss Lockhart arguing violently with Miss Sinclair."

The images showed Vivian apparently wrestling something from Olivia's grasp, culminating in a shot where Olivia appeared to be shoved to the floor.

"Miss Lockhart explicitly threatened to stop the wedding," Evelyn added solemnly.

The crowd erupted.

"What kind of monster attacks a bride on her wedding day?"
"Bitter much? Just because she got dumped doesn't mean she can ruin others' happiness!"
Nathan rounded on Vivian. "What did you say to make Olivia disappear?"

Amid the onslaught, Vivian remained composed. "I did meet with Miss Sinclair earlier. But there was no argument - she insisted I take an envelope from her. That's the moment captured in these photos."

"As for her current whereabouts, I have absolutely no knowledge."

The guests exchanged skeptical glances. Seizing the moment, Margaret Whitmore struck. "Drop the innocent act, Lockhart. Your cruelty is legendary."

"You didn't spare Cassandra when she was pregnant. Why would you show mercy to my cousin's true love?"

Margaret's smile turned venomous. "Everyone knows Ethan never got over Olivia. This was your perfect revenge opportunity."

"Their love story is public knowledge! Why would she give you anything important?"

"And how do you explain photos of you assaulting her?"
###Chapter 259

Charlotte's words acted like gasoline on fire, instantly turning the crowd against Vivian.

In mere seconds, Vivian became the villain in their eyes. Cruel. Heartless. A witch who deserved punishment. Only Ethan and Dominic stood by her side.

"Enough!" Dominic's voice cut through the chaos like a blade.

He produced an exquisite ring box and handed it to Ethan. "Put this on Miss Lockhart. Now."

Understanding flashed in Ethan's eyes. Without hesitation, he grabbed Vivian's hand, attempting to slide the ring onto her finger.

Vivian recoiled. "What the hell? You can't just force a ring on someone! Get it off me!"

"Wear it." Ethan's command left no room for argument.

Their struggle became a physical tug-of-war, Vivian's resistance meeting Ethan's determination head-on.

Ding. Ding. Ding.

The church bells chimed again, signaling sunset. As golden light spilled through stained glass windows, the ancient prophecy echoed through the hall:

"When rings are exchanged at sunset's call, the sea goddess blesses them all. Bound forever, hand in hand, peace shall reign across the land."

Ethan finally succeeded in forcing the ring onto Vivian's finger, but not without cost - Vivian's shove sent him stumbling backward.

He fell dramatically, the moment perfectly captured by Dominic's phone.

The photo told a damning story. The composition mirrored exactly Vivian's earlier "fight" with Olivia.

"See?" Dominic held up the evidence. "This proves Miss Lockhart's story. That wasn't a fight - she was refusing something."

Only then did Vivian understand their plan. Her grateful eyes met Ethan's, though no words passed her lips.

Ethan smirked. "Save your thanks. If the legend's true, we're stuck together now. You'll have eternity to show your gratitude."

Vivian rolled her eyes. 'God, I must be an idiot. Expecting decency from this man? Please.'

'That sly fox thinks a ring can trap me? Dream on.'

Evelyn Sinclair hadn't anticipated Ethan's intervention, let alone the groom defending Vivian. For once, the actress was speechless.

After a long pause, Evelyn found her voice. "But I saw Miss Lockhart throw that necklace into the sea! That proves she hated Olivia enough to hurt her!"

Vivian nodded. "I did throw it away. Olivia told me to dispose of it as I pleased. Frankly, I wanted nothing to do with it."

Nathan exploded. "You admit it! Do you have any idea what that necklace meant to Olivia? You vicious witch!"

Vivian shrugged. "No clue."

'Some token of their undying love, right? If it was so precious, why force it on me?'

Ethan's expression darkened. "You threw it away?"

Just as Vivian prepared her retort, a panicked shout cut through the tension.

"Help! Someone help! It's terrible!"
###Chapter 260

All eyes snapped toward the panting resort employee.

Marcus Donovan's face glistened with sweat as he struggled to catch his breath. "The Crescent Cliff—"

His words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd. "We found Miss Sinclair's shoe near the edge! She must have—"

The unspoken conclusion hung heavy in the air. Olivia Sinclair had plunged into the ocean.

Nathan Prescott's face drained of color. "She can't swim!" His voice cracked with panic. "We have to find her now!"

He sprinted toward the dangerous coastline, with Dominic Harrington and Ethan Blackwood close behind.

Vivian Lockhart stood frozen for a heartbeat before joining the flood of concerned guests heading toward the accident site.

The waters at Crescent Cliff appeared deceptively calm in the fading light. But as dusk settled, visibility became dangerously limited.

Vivian studied the abandoned heels placed neatly at the cliff's edge. A suspicious detail. "Could Miss Sinclair have removed her shoes intentionally?" she mused aloud. "Perhaps she went elsewhere?"

Evelyn Sinclair scoffed, clinging to Vivian's side like a shadow. "Don't be absurd!" Her shrill voice carried across the gathering crowd. "Olivia would never abandon her own wedding! Are you trying to cover your tracks, Miss Lockhart?"

Vivian's expression turned glacial. "What exactly would I be covering?"

"You pushed her!" Evelyn accused, pointing a trembling finger. "You're the only one with motive! If anything happens to Olivia, you'll pay for this!"

The accusation ignited the crowd. Victoria Sinclair, Olivia's mother, lunged at Vivian with red-rimmed eyes. "You monster! Give me back my daughter!"

Vivian understood maternal grief, but patience had its limits. She stood her ground, arms crossed. "Mrs. Sinclair, think logically. Why would I harm your daughter? What possible reason could I have?"

"Liar!" Victoria shrieked, swinging wildly. "The photos prove everything! First you hit her, now this—you won't get away with it!"

Vivian instinctively shielded her abdomen as blows rained down. "I'm warning you—"

The mob mentality took over. Sinclair family members and wedding guests closed in, their accusations turning physical. Vivian clenched her fists, ready to defend herself against the unjust assault.

A strong arm yanked her backward. Ethan Blackwood's imposing frame shielded her completely. His glacial glare silenced the advancing crowd. "Touch her," he challenged, "and find out what happens."

Victoria collapsed into hysterical sobs. "Ethan! You loved Olivia once! How can you protect her killer?"

Ethan's jaw tightened. "Accusations require evidence. Vivian is under my protection." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Harm her, and you answer to me."

Nathan Prescott turned his fury on Ethan. "The evidence is obvious! And since when do you care about your ex-wife? Why defend her now?"
###Chapter 261

"Four years of marriage! How could she mean nothing to me?" Ethan's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Vivian stood frozen behind him, emotions churning in her chest.

Never had she imagined Ethan would defend her so publicly. Nor had she expected those particular words to leave his lips.

'Isn't he supposed to be the one who despises me most? The man who couldn't wait to erase our marriage? Why is he acting like he cares?'

Dominic stepped forward. "Nathaniel's right. There's zero evidence implicating Miss Lockhart in Olivia's fall. No one lays a finger on her until we have proof."

"Split up and search the area. We need to find Olivia immediately!"

The crowd dispersed, voices calling Olivia's name as they fanned out across the shoreline.

Ethan joined the search, his movements frantic. Vivian trailed behind, torn between gratitude and confusion.

She wanted to thank him for that unexpected defense. But his entire being radiated panic as he scanned the crashing waves.

'Of course. Olivia Sinclair always held a special place in his heart. Even if he didn't run away with her, he never stopped caring.'

"Ethan—" Vivian quickened her pace to match his long strides.

He barely glanced at her, laser-focused on the turbulent waters. "What?"

That dismissive tone made her cheeks burn. "I... just wanted to thank you. For standing up for me back there."

"Don't." His eyes never left the ocean. "But if I discover you harmed her, I'll handle you myself."

Her stomach plunged like a stone.

'Stupid. Mistaking basic decency for lingering affection.'

'Wake up, Vivian. Ethan Blackwood never loved you. If he had, he wouldn't have brought his mistress home and forced that divorce.'

Suddenly Ethan surged forward like a torpedo, swimming with terrifying determination toward the deadly riptide.

"Over there! I see her!" someone screamed.

Vivian's gaze snapped to a distant shape bobbing in the waves.

Olivia. Drifting further into the deadly deep with every passing second.

Ethan powered through the churning water, closing the distance despite the obvious danger.

The onlookers held their breath. One wrong move and the sea would claim them both.

"Come back!" Vivian's scream tore from her throat. "Ethan Blackwood, turn around now! Are you trying to die?"
###Chapter 262

Vivian's screams echoed uselessly across the crashing waves. Ethan kept swimming forward without hesitation, his broad shoulders cutting through the turbulent water like a man possessed.

"Fine! Drown then! See if I care!" Vivian's nails dug into her palms as she watched his retreating figure. The sharp pain grounded her against the rising panic. "You selfish bastard! Is she really worth dying for?"

The realization hit her like a physical blow - the infamous Ice King of Wall Street wasn't incapable of love. He just reserved every ounce of it for Olivia Sinclair.

Ethan reached Olivia in minutes, his powerful strokes cutting through the current with ease. He hooked an arm around her waist, turning back toward shore.

Then the ocean roared.

A monstrous wave swallowed them whole, dragging both figures beneath the churning surface. The water calmed moments later - empty.

"No!" Vivian's knees buckled. Her vision tunneled until all she saw was the spot where Ethan had disappeared. Her throat burned from screaming for help.

Nathan and Dominic arrived with a security team, but the crew hesitated at the water's edge. The riptide warnings flashed red on the nearby monitors.

"Move your asses! They're drowning!" Vivian's voice cracked. Tears mixed with salt spray on her cheeks. Only the twins kicking in her womb stopped her from plunging in herself.

Nathan lunged forward, only to be yanked back by Dominic. The usually composed lawyer's face had gone sheet-white. "We'll have more casualties if we rush in blindly. The coast guard's en route."

"Fuck protocol!" Nathan wrestled against Dominic's grip. "That's Ethan out there! And Olivia!"

Vivian wasn't listening. She'd already taken three steps into the surf when strong arms wrapped around her waist.

"Ms. Lockhart! Stop!" Dominic hauled her back, seawater soaking his designer slacks. "You'll get yourself killed!"

"Let me go!" Vivian twisted violently, then froze when a cramp shot through her abdomen. The babies. She had to think of the babies. "I just... I need to see..."

Her breath came in ragged gasps. The lie tasted bitter. She needed to see him alive. Needed those piercing dark eyes glaring at her with their usual irritation.

Dominic lifted her effortlessly, ignoring her weak struggles. "Ethan's survived worse. Remember the yacht explosion in Monaco? The man's part shark."

Vivian went limp. The memory flashed through her mind - Ethan emerging from flaming wreckage with nothing but a scorched shirt and that infuriating smirk.

"Put me down," she muttered, but the fight had drained from her voice. The sunset painted Dominic's determined expression in gold. For the first time since Ethan disappeared, hope flickered in her chest.

Maybe... just maybe, the bastard would survive this too.
###Chapter 263

Dominic led Vivian to a sheltered spot and carefully seated her. "I apologize if I overstepped," he murmured, his voice laced with genuine concern. "Panic got the better of me. I hope you can forgive me."

Vivian exhaled, her earlier fury dissipating. "No, I should be thanking you. I lost control back there."

A quiet realization settled over her. Why does my ex-husband's fate still affect me like this? Our marriage is over.

Yet even as logic returned, Vivian couldn't tear her gaze from the churning waves. Arms crossed tightly, she silently pleaded, Come back, Nathaniel Blackwood. If not for me, then for our children. Please come back.

Then—miraculously—he did.

Against all odds, Nathaniel emerged from the violent currents, his powerful strokes cutting through the water as he fought his way to shore.

"They're here! They made it!" The crowd erupted in relieved cheers, rushing forward to help.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Nathaniel as he passed Olivia to Dominic and Nathan before collapsing onto the sand, chest heaving.

"My baby! Olivia, darling, look at me!" Olivia's mother sobbed, clutching her daughter's limp form as medics swarmed around them.

Vivian approached Nathaniel, hastily wiping away traitorous tears before adopting her usual sharp tone.

"Impressive, Mr. Blackwood. Who knew you fancied yourself a hero? Planning to single-handedly repopulate the shark population?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm, but her eyes betrayed her worry. "What's next? Donating yourself to science?"

Too drained to retaliate, Nathaniel could only marvel at how the sunlight haloed Vivian's features, making his pulse stutter despite his fatigue.

"Maybe I should start calling you Sir Gallant," Vivian continued her teasing, though her fingers twitched with the urge to check him for injuries. "So? How's our knight in shining armor holding up? Need an ambulance? Or perhaps a medal?"

Nathaniel finally caught his breath—then dramatically clutched his chest. "I... can't... breathe..."

Vivian arched a skeptical brow. People who can't breathe don't talk in complete sentences.

"Quick!" Nathaniel gasped theatrically, eyelids fluttering. "Air... I need... air!"

"Are you suggesting CPR?"

"If you insist," he wheezed, the picture of suffering—though his lips twitched suspiciously.

Vivian tapped her chin, feigning deep thought before snapping her fingers. "I've got just the solution!"

Nathaniel closed his eyes, barely suppressing a grin. He could practically feel her lips already—

"Ready?" Vivian asked, voice uncharacteristically soft.

Nathaniel nodded eagerly—

—only to recoil in horror when something cold and wet smacked against his mouth. His eyes flew open to find Vivian pressing a water bottle to his lips.

"Vivian Lockhart!" he roared, saltwater dripping from his furious scowl.

She smirked, triumphant. "Hydration is crucial after seawater exposure, Sir Gallant."
###Chapter 264

The CPR wasn't being administered by Vivian as Ethan had hoped. Instead, it was a sunburnt rescue worker with arms like tree trunks.

"Goddammit!" Ethan sprang up violently, shoving the man backward with enough force to send him sprawling across the sand.

Vivian's face lit up with pure relief. "Nathaniel! You're alive! Thank heavens!"

"Was this your idea of a joke, Lockhart?" Ethan scrubbed at his mouth repeatedly with the back of his hand, his expression twisted in disgust.

'This is humiliating,' he thought bitterly. 'Nathaniel Blackwood, fooled like some naive schoolboy. That little minx will pay for this.'

What Ethan didn't know was Vivian's genuine concern. She'd truly believed he needed resuscitation and had gone out of her way to find the most qualified person available.

Seeing him full of vigor now, Vivian couldn't contain her joy. She threw her arms around him without thinking. "You made it! Dominic was right - you're indestructible!"

The anger drained from Ethan's body the moment her soft form pressed against him. Her obvious worry made it impossible to stay mad.

This caring version of Vivian was unfamiliar territory. Clearing his throat, he teased, "If you're so afraid I'll die, why claim you wouldn't shed tears? Such a little liar."

His words snapped Vivian back to reality. She pushed away abruptly. "You don't value your own life. Why should I mourn you?"

"Then explain these tear tracks—"

"Sea spray! Nothing more!"

"And your soaked dress? Did you actually try diving in after me?"

"I enjoy beach walks! Not everything's about you!" Vivian crossed her arms stubbornly.

Ethan's expression softened. "Fine, fine. You don't care at all. Just know I'll always come back, no matter what happens."

"Again?!" Vivian's face darkened as if he'd said something outrageous. Her palm connected sharply with his cheek.

Her fist hovered threateningly near his face. "Die next time if you want to be so reckless! Save everyone the worry!"

"Worry?" Ethan's lips curved knowingly. "I thought you didn't care?"

Vivian faltered, caught in her own contradiction. The truth was obvious - despite her denials, she still cared deeply. Her entire being was attuned to his safety.

She told herself it was only for the children's sake. He was their father, after all.

A gentle breeze carried the unspoken tension between them as they stood in silent understanding.

The moment shattered when urgent shouts came. "She's awake! Miss Sinclair is conscious!"

Exchanging glances, Ethan and Vivian hurried over.

Olivia had swallowed dangerous amounts of seawater, remaining unconscious for hours. After extensive resuscitation efforts, she'd finally expelled the water and regained breathing.

Though cradled in Dominic's arms, her darting eyes searched the crowd frantically for one particular face.
###Chapter 265

Victoria Sinclair's mother clung to her hand, tears streaming down her face. "Darling, are you all right? What are you searching for? Look at me—"

"Ethan..." Victoria's voice was barely a whisper, raw and fragile.

After facing death, she refused to hide her feelings any longer.

She loved Nathaniel Blackwood. There was no moving on from him.

The only person she wanted to see right now—was him.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

The air thickened with tension. Everyone shared the same unspoken thought.

The bride just survived drowning, and the first thing she does is ask for another man... Poor Dominic Harrington.

Dominic's jaw tightened, but he kept his voice gentle. "Ethan risked his life to save you. You should thank him properly."

"He did?" Color returned to Victoria's pale face, her eyes welling with fresh tears. "I knew it—he still cares! Where is he? I need to see him!"

At the edge of the crowd, Nathaniel gripped Vivian Lockhart's wrist, ready to leave.

Vivian didn't budge. "Oh, come on, Mr. Hero. You can't just walk away without taking credit."

He shot her a warning glare. "Keep talking, and I'll toss you into the ocean next."

She smirked. "Fine, fine. Wouldn’t want to upset the noble savior."

Then, the guests parted—and Victoria finally saw him.

"Ethan—"

Her joy shattered when she noticed his fingers laced tightly with Vivian's.

He saved me... only to hold her hand instead of waiting for me?

Hope flickered and died in her chest, over and over, all day.

Jealousy took root, spreading like wildfire through her veins.

She swallowed it down, forcing a fragile smile. "Ethan, I heard you jumped in after me... You’ve saved me so many times. How can I ever repay you?"

Nathaniel's expression remained cold. "Instinct. Don’t mention it."

His words cut deeper than any blade.

He once gave up everything for me. Even his life. Now, he won’t even acknowledge our past...

Evelyn Sinclair watched the scene unfold. As an actress, she recognized unrequited love when she saw it.

Victoria was still obsessed. Nathaniel had moved on—clearly, to his ex-wife.

Evelyn had been struggling to find a way to eliminate Vivian as competition. But now... she had an idea.

She approached the "bride," feigning concern. "Oh, Victoria! Everyone was so worried! How did you even fall in? You were fine earlier—unless someone pushed you?"
###Chapter 266

"I—"

Olivia Sinclair still felt weak. Her vision swam as she gazed at the crowd, lips trembling with unspoken words.

"I saw you with Ms. Lockhart earlier," Evelyn Sinclair remarked pointedly, fanning herself with deliberate slowness. "You seemed upset then. Was she the last person you were with?"

The implication hung thick in the air—Vivian Lockhart had pushed Olivia overboard!

Years navigating the cutthroat entertainment industry had taught Evelyn valuable tactics. Manipulating others to eliminate rivals remained her favorite strategy—effortless and effective.

"Darling!" Olivia's mother gripped her shoulders urgently. "Tell us the truth! Did that woman push you? If she did, your father and I will make her pay!"

"Mother—" Olivia bit her lip, playing the reluctant victim. "Let's drop this. Ms. Lockhart and I are friends. It was... an accident."

The truth? No one had pushed her. Heartbroken by Nathaniel Blackwood's rejection, she'd attempted suicide in despair. But seeing Nathaniel holding Vivian's hand had ignited such jealousy that framing Vivian became irresistible.

No man would stay with an attempted murderer.

As predicted, Nathaniel immediately released Vivian's hand.

His glacial stare pierced through Vivian. "Explain," he demanded, voice dripping with suspicion.

Gasps erupted around them.

"How could she? Such darkness in her heart!" someone whispered.

Vivian clenched her fists. Again, she'd become the villain.

"Olivia," she snapped, pointing accusingly. "Stop playing games! Either accuse me properly or retract your insinuations!"

Olivia recoiled dramatically, tears streaming. "Please don't be angry! I-I won't press charges! Let's just say I slipped!"

"Liar!" Vivian lunged forward, gripping Olivia's arm painfully tight. "Say it outright if you're accusing me! Then I can sue you for defamation! Drop the innocent act—you've already attacked me!"

How wrong she'd been about Olivia. That initial letter had painted her as intelligent, above petty jealousy. But clearly, she'd lost both her mind and morals.

"Stop!" Olivia sobbed, clutching her mother. "I feel dizzy... need to lie down!"

"You nearly drowned, darling!" her mother cried. "We're going to the hospital now!"
###Chapter 267

Margaret Whitmore turned sharply to Dominic Harrington. "Get your bride to the hospital now, Dominic. Hurry! If she stays here another second, I swear someone might kill her!"

Dominic's response was ice-cold. "Of course. But before I go, let me make one thing clear—the wedding between Olivia Sinclair and me is officially canceled. Our relationship ends today." His voice carried across the stunned crowd. "I apologize for dragging all of you into this mess. Rest assured, the Blackwood family will compensate everyone for their wasted time."

Gasps erupted.

Nathan Prescott paled, stepping forward in panic. "What the hell, Dom? You're seriously calling off the wedding now? Do you realize how cruel that is? Tell me you're joking!"

Dominic didn’t answer. He simply scooped Olivia into his arms and strode away, leaving chaos in his wake.

The crowd dispersed quickly, eager to escape the drama. Soon, only Ethan Blackwood, Vivian Lockhart, and the infamous actress Evelyn Sinclair remained on the beach.

Evelyn batted her lashes, feigning innocence. "Ms. Lockhart, I was only telling the truth earlier. You don’t blame me, do you?"

Vivian smirked. "Oh, I see your game. You used someone else to attack your real target—me. Clever. Your hatred is obvious, Evelyn. But here’s what I don’t get—why? What did I ever do to you?"

Evelyn clutched her chest dramatically. "Ms. Lockhart! How can you accuse me like this? I was just being honest! Are you really punishing me for telling the truth?"

Vivian wasn’t fooled. "Save the act. You’re a public figure, Evelyn. If you want my ex-husband, just say it. Stop wasting time with these pathetic schemes." She gave Evelyn a slow, mocking once-over. "You’ve got the looks. That tiny waist of yours? Perfect for Ethan’s tastes. Maybe if you flaunted it more, you wouldn’t need to sabotage other women."

Evelyn’s face burned crimson. She sucked in her stomach instinctively, then shot Ethan a sultry glance.

Vivian nearly laughed. Unbelievable. She actually fell for that.

Evelyn was supposed to be A-list, sophisticated—yet here she was, shamelessly pandering to Ethan like some desperate groupie.

Vivian nudged Ethan playfully. "Well? Aren’t you going to say something? The famous Evelyn Sinclair just confessed her undying love for you!"

Ethan’s expression darkened. His piercing gaze locked onto Vivian, icy and unamused. He wasn’t in the mood for games.

But Vivian, ever the provocateur, grinned. "Why not shake hands? Consider this your official introduction. Just remember to pay me a matchmaker’s fee when you two—"

"Ah!"

Ethan’s hand clamped around her wrist like a vise. Pain shot up her arm. "Have you lost your mind, Ethan Blackwood? Let go!"

His grip only tightened. His eyes burned with fury. "Explain yourself."
###Chapter 268

Vivian's lips curved into a bitter smile, her eyes turning to ice.

In that instant, her heart shattered.

She had never imagined Ethan would ask such a foolish question. The fact that he did proved one thing—there was an unbridgeable gap between them now. Whether he believed her or not no longer mattered.

"I have nothing to explain," Vivian said, her voice steady. "If you trust me, no words are necessary. If you don't, nothing I say will change your mind. I could tear my heart out and show it to you, and you'd still doubt me."

She wrenched her wrist free from his grip. Her expression was cold, indifferent.

Then, as if his opinion meant nothing to her, she added, "Do whatever you want. I'm leaving."

Without another glance, she turned and walked away. No hesitation. No lingering emotions.

What did it matter if he thought she was a monster? In his eyes, she had always been the villain.

Ethan watched her go, his jaw clenched. Anger burned inside him—partly because Olivia had nearly drowned, but mostly because he had lost control.

He prided himself on always being in command. But Vivian Lockhart defied him at every turn.

He didn’t even know if she had truly pushed Olivia into the water. What infuriated him more was her refusal to defend herself. Her utter indifference gnawed at him.

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of amber. Darkness crept in, swallowing the last remnants of light.

Only Ethan and Evelyn remained on the beach.

Evelyn’s lips curled in satisfaction. Her moment had finally come.

Summoning her courage, she approached him with calculated grace. "Mr. Blackwood," she said softly, "do you have a moment? There’s something I’d like to discuss."

Ethan turned, his gaze icy. "Do I know you?"

He paid little attention to celebrities. To him, Evelyn Sinclair was just another face in the crowd, despite her fame.

"You may not recognize me," she said, batting her lashes, "but I’ve admired you for a long time. I’ll be working with Blackwood Group soon. We’ll be seeing a lot of each other."

"Will we?"

Ethan studied her.

Evelyn was undeniably beautiful—flawless bone structure, delicate features, lips like rose petals. She had crafted herself meticulously, tailoring every detail to appeal to men like him.

Her entire career had been a calculated climb toward one goal: securing a place by his side.

After all, wasn’t that the fate of every starlet? To marry into wealth and power?

But Ethan saw right through her.

"What’s your history with Vivian?" he demanded, cutting straight to the point.

Evelyn’s smile faltered. "I—I don’t understand."

"You targeted her earlier. Why?"

"That’s not true!" she protested, her eyes darting away. "I barely know her. I only spoke the truth about what I saw. Why would I lie about a stranger?"
###Chapter 269

"You're lying!"

Ethan's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn like a predator sizing up its prey. His lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Didn't you just claim to have admired me for years?"

"Then how is it you've never heard of my ex-wife's name?"

Evelyn froze, her breath hitching. As a seasoned actress, she was used to spinning lies effortlessly—people usually swallowed them without question.

But Ethan saw right through her.

Her mind scrambled for an excuse. "I—I meant I’ve never met Ms. Lockhart personally, but of course I know of her! Your 'Chase My Lockhart' ship is huge online. Half the industry follows it."

Ethan cut her off coldly. "If you admire me so much, you must resent her for being close to me."

"That’s why you targeted her from the start." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "You took that damning photo deliberately. You manipulated everyone into believing she pushed Olivia into the sea. Am I wrong?"

Evelyn’s face burned crimson. The pressure was suffocating. "N-No! That’s not—I didn’t—!"

She was a queen in Hollywood, accustomed to adoration and flattery. But under Ethan’s merciless scrutiny, she felt exposed—stripped bare.

His icy disdain only deepened. "Did you really think removing Vivian would clear your path?" A cruel laugh escaped him. "Even without her, a scheming viper like you could never hold my interest. Stop wasting your time."

He’d seen countless women throw themselves at him, each more transparent than the last.

Evelyn Sinclair was beautiful, yes—but her ambition reeked of desperation. Her eyes held too much greed.

Unlike Vivian.

Vivian’s gaze had always been clear, untainted by ulterior motives. Pure.

That was why she stood apart.

Evelyn watched Ethan turn away, her fists clenching. "I never took you for such an arrogant bastard, Mr. Blackwood!"

His brutal rejection was a slap to her pride. She was used to worship, not humiliation.

Her voice turned venomous. "I did admire you—but you’re so insufferably conceited, it’s no wonder your first love left you! No wonder your wife divorced you!"

Ethan stopped dead.

She’d struck a nerve.

"And your precious ex-wife?" Evelyn sneered. "She’s not as innocent as you think. Why else would both Olivia and I use her as a pawn?"

Her smirk widened. "Think about it. Would Olivia really risk her life to frame some nobody?"

Ethan’s expression darkened.

Vivian Lockhart…

Did you really push Olivia?

Why wouldn’t you defend yourself?

Was it… guilt?
###Chapter 270

The entire incident weighed heavily on Ethan's mind. He wouldn't find peace until he uncovered the truth.

Taking a deep breath, he resolved to confront the key person involved—Olivia Sinclair.

Olivia had been rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Though out of immediate danger, concerns lingered about potential brain, heart, and lung damage from prolonged submersion. Doctors insisted on keeping her under observation for several more days.

The guests had all departed, leaving only Olivia's parents, Dominic, and Nathan lingering outside her private ward. The air was thick with tension.

Olivia's mother twisted her hands nervously before addressing Dominic. "Dom... With everyone gone now, perhaps we should discuss things properly between you and Liv?"

Dominic kept his hands in his pockets, his expression calm and composed. The usual warmth in his eyes remained unchanged.

"What would you like to discuss?" His voice was steady.

"You know Liv has always been indecisive, yet stubborn at times. As her mother, I can tell she still holds some lingering feelings for Ethan—"

"Ridiculous!" Olivia's father cut in sharply, glaring at his wife before softening his tone toward Dominic. "If things had gone as planned, I'd already be calling you my son-in-law. Pay no mind to her nonsense. Liv has no feelings left for Ethan Blackwood. She's just too kind-hearted—she blames herself for hurting him in the past. But her love for you is genuine. Once she recovers, we'll reschedule the wedding. Everything will work out."

"Yes, exactly!" Olivia's mother hastily amended. "I misspoke earlier. It's not about feelings—just regret. Her love for you is real. Don't let this misunderstanding ruin your future together!"

They weren't fools. The Harringtons were one of Newport City's most influential families—an opportunity they wouldn't let slip away.

Dominic's expression remained unreadable. "You've misunderstood. My decision to end things with Olivia today wasn't because of her or Ethan. It's something I've considered for a long time."

He continued evenly, "The truth is, I've realized we're fundamentally incompatible. Perhaps we clung to the relationship out of sentiment or sunk cost. In a way, I should thank Liv—her actions gave me the courage to finally walk away."

"What?!"

Her parents stared in stunned silence. They never expected Dominic—who'd once adored Olivia—to change his mind so decisively.

"Dom!" Nathan snapped, his voice uncharacteristically sharp. He'd always revered Dominic like an older brother, but now his patience had shattered. "Have you lost your mind? Do you even hear yourself? You sound like a complete bastard!"

"Or have you forgotten how serious Liv and Ethan were? They were planning marriage! If you hadn't interfered, they'd probably have two kids by now! You made her second-guess everything, and now that Ethan's finally moved on, you're dumping her? I ought to punch you right now!"

Dominic exhaled, shoulders slumping. "You're right. I am a bastard. If hitting me lessens Liv's pain, I won't resist."

Nathan froze, fist clenched midair—utterly at a loss.
###Chapter 271

Nathaniel's fists clenched tightly, but ultimately, he had no choice but to release them.

If he actually threw a punch at Dominic now, their fragile reconciliation would shatter. The three friends had only just begun to mend their strained relationship after years of distance.

"Fine! You've dragged this mess out for years, and I'm sick of it!" Nathaniel snapped, his voice sharp with frustration. "Do whatever the hell you want. I'm done."

With that, he turned on his heel and stormed off. He had bigger problems to deal with—like the looming criminal case that threatened to land him behind bars for a long time.

His father had warned him: this week was his last chance at freedom. If he lost this case, his future would be ruined.

Right now, he needed a top-tier lawyer. And the only one capable of winning this case was Alexander Graves.

But Alexander worked for Isabella Lockhart—the very woman Nathaniel had just publicly clashed with.

He was screwed.

"Mr. Sinclair," Dominic said once Nathaniel was gone, his tone respectful but firm. "Mrs. Sinclair, I apologize for the trouble I've caused. I'll do everything in my power to make it right. For now, let's focus on Olivia's recovery. If you'll excuse me."

He bowed slightly, his words polite but his stance unyielding.

Olivia's mother couldn't hold back her tears any longer. She grabbed Dominic's arm desperately. "Dominic, please! You and Olivia have been together for years. How can you just walk away? Both families approved of this marriage. You're perfect for each other—love isn't everything in a relationship!"

Dominic smiled faintly. "You're right. But I'm tired—of being the perfect son, the perfect friend, the perfect boyfriend. I'm done living by other people's expectations."

He paused, then added, "Ethan is single now. So is Olivia. If they want to rekindle what they had, I won't stand in their way. In fact, I'd be happy for them."

Olivia's mother gasped. "You're jealous! You think she still loves him, but that's not true! She just—"

The door behind them swung open.

Olivia stood there, her face pale.

"Mom, stop!" Her voice trembled with humiliation. "I respect his decision. Let him go. Don't make this harder than it already is."

The truth was, she had known for a while that Dominic no longer loved her. She had hoped this day would come before the wedding—before she became a divorcee.

Her suicide attempt wasn't just because of Ethan's betrayal.

It was because Dominic had grown cold.

These men had stopped loving her, and that realization had broken her.

Dominic met her gaze, his expression apologetic but resolute. "You never stopped loving Ethan. Now that he's free, go after him."

Just then, the elevator doors opened—and Ethan stepped out.
###Chapter 272

His sudden appearance sent shockwaves through the room.

Margaret Whitmore recovered first. Seeing her potential son-in-law Dominic slipping away, she immediately latched onto Ethan instead.

"Ethan, darling! Olivia has been talking about you nonstop. There's just been a silly misunderstanding between you two. You should really sort it out now!"

She continued eagerly, "The thing is, Olivia was so young and inexperienced back then. She didn't understand real love—"

"Mother!" Olivia Sinclair cut her off sharply, humiliation burning her cheeks. Both men who once adored her now wanted nothing to do with her. If her mother kept groveling like this, she'd lose every ounce of dignity.

Dominic remained unfazed. He casually clapped Ethan on the shoulder. "I'll leave this to you. I trust you'll handle it... appropriately."

His calm demeanor made Ethan look like the runaway groom instead.

Ethan didn't waste time. "Olivia, can we speak privately?"

She bit her lip and nodded coquettishly. "For you? Always."

Once inside the private ward, Ethan shut the door firmly. When Olivia tried closing the distance between them, he took three large steps back.

"You nearly drowned," he said coolly. "You should be resting."

The rejection stung. Olivia retreated to her bed, but when she met Ethan's gaze, she saw unexpected warmth there.

"So you're not completely heartless after all," she observed. "I still matter to you, don't I?"

"Of course you do," Ethan admitted frankly. "You were someone I loved deeply. One of my closest confidantes. I'm not made of stone—you'll always be important to me."

"Were? Loved?" Olivia's bitter smile couldn't mask her anguish. "Sometimes I wish you'd never loved me at all. This pain of losing you... it's unbearable."

The memory of his love made its absence excruciating.

Ethan rubbed his temples in frustration. When had the strong, independent Olivia Sinclair become this lovesick shadow of herself?

"Enough," he said sharply. "Dwelling on the past will only ruin what's left between us. Do you want to destroy even our friendship?"

"So that's it?" Tears spilled down Olivia's cheeks as her composure shattered. "Even though we're both free now, there's no chance for us?"

"None," Ethan stated firmly, holding her gaze. "My feelings are gone. Whether you marry Dominic or not—it doesn't concern me."

The words shattered Olivia's heart. But this time, no suicidal thoughts followed.

'Men aren't worth dying for,' she thought bitterly.

Wiping her tears, she composed herself. "If you don't care, why bother coming here?"

Ethan got straight to the point. "Just answer me one thing—did Vivian really push you?"

Olivia's tearful expression transformed instantly. She burst into hysterical laughter, as if hearing the world's funniest joke.

Ethan's frown deepened. "What the hell is so funny?"
###Chapter 273

Olivia Sinclair's laughter echoed through the sterile hospital room.

She struggled to catch her breath, her mocking tone cutting through the air like a blade. "Oh, Ethan... You're absolutely hilarious!"

Her smirk widened as she continued, "I thought what you and Vivian Lockhart had was unbreakable. Steel-strong, wasn't it? And yet—here you are, crumbling over something so small."

A bitter chuckle escaped her lips. "Tell me, Ethan... Do you really love her more than you loved me?"

Ethan Blackwood's jaw tightened, his expression darkening.

"I never claimed to love her," he said coldly.

Olivia's eyes gleamed with triumph. "Exactly."

She leaned back against her pillows, satisfaction curling her lips. "If you truly loved her, you wouldn't even question it. But you did. Which means... you don't. Or maybe you just don't know her at all."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "The real question isn't whether she pushed me. It's whether you believe she could."

Silence settled between them.

Ethan's fingers curled into fists at his sides, his mind racing. Olivia's words struck deeper than he wanted to admit.

"I thought I'd lost," Olivia murmured, closing her eyes. "But it seems the game isn't over yet."

She turned her face away, dismissing him. "I'm tired. Figure it out yourself."

Ethan left without another word.

No answers. Only doubts.

If this was love—real love—wouldn't he trust her without hesitation?

The thought gnawed at him.

Nathaniel Blackwood, he chastised himself, get your damn emotions under control.

The next morning, Vivian woke feeling lighter than she had in months.

Last night's fight with Ethan?

Gone from her mind like morning mist.

The man who once held her heart—who could ruin her mood with a single glance—no longer had that power.

Freedom tasted sweet.

"Good morning, Miss Vivian!"

Evelyn Whitmore entered with a tray of breakfast, her smile warm. "Sleep well?"

"Like a dream," Vivian said, grinning. "Literally."

She sat up, excitement bubbling in her chest. "I dreamed about the babies—two little butterflies, one black, one white. They flew around me, laughing. They talked to me, Evelyn! They're so ready to meet the world."

The dream had been so vivid, so real—it left her heart aching with anticipation.

But Evelyn's smile faltered.

"Butterflies?" she repeated slowly.

Vivian blinked. "Yes... Why?"

Evelyn hesitated. "In some cultures, butterflies... represent souls who've passed on."

A chill ran down Vivian's spine.

"No, no," Evelyn quickly added, knocking on the wooden nightstand. "Bad luck be gone! Just superstition."

But the seed of worry had been planted.

The toadstool soup. The reckless swim in the ocean.

Had she endangered them?

Her hands instinctively cradled her stomach.

"I need a check-up," she said firmly. "Today."
###Chapter 274

Vivian Lockhart and Evelyn Whitmore arrived at the exclusive maternity clinic where Vivian regularly received her prenatal care.

The waiting room was quiet, filled with the soft hum of hushed conversations. Evelyn kept a firm grip on Vivian's wrist, monitoring her pulse with practiced ease.

"Your pulse is steady, Miss Vivian. The babies are fine. You can't let a nightmare shake you like this. Let’s just stay positive, alright?"

Vivian nodded, but unease still coiled in her chest.

"I know they're strong. I've been careful. But I can't shake this feeling—like something's wrong."

"Don’t say that!" Evelyn scolded gently. "You trust my family’s medical knowledge, don’t you? I’ve treated everything from fevers to broken bones with herbs alone. There’s nothing to fear."

Vivian exhaled. "You’re right. With you here, I’m in the best hands."

She stepped into the examination room, and soon, the results confirmed what Evelyn had assured her—both babies were healthy, thriving despite Vivian’s recent stress. They were resilient, untouched by her restless nights.

"Ms. Lockhart," the doctor said, "in a week, you’ll enter your second trimester. The nausea will fade, your energy will return, and your babies will grow stronger. You’ll need looser clothing soon. Don’t forget your supplements, and rest well."

After prescribing vitamins and calcium, the doctor dismissed her.

Vivian emerged, waving the report at Evelyn. "You were right! They’re perfect. I worried for nothing."

Evelyn beamed. "I told you! The Lockhart family is rising again—and soon, two new heirs will join the legacy."

They left the clinic, waiting by the curb for a cab.

But Vivian’s instincts prickled. She resisted the urge to glance back.

"What’s wrong?" Evelyn asked.

"We’re being followed."

Vivian kept her voice light, her expression relaxed, but her grip on Evelyn’s arm tightened in warning.

"What?!" Evelyn stiffened, eyes darting. "By who?"

"Don’t look," Vivian murmured. "Just act normal."

Evelyn swallowed hard, pulling Vivian closer. "Is it an enemy? I’ll protect you, but you need to run if—"

"Not an enemy," Vivian cut in. "They’ve had plenty of chances to strike. This is something else."

"Then who—?"

At the corner, Vivian suddenly stopped. Without turning, she called out, "Enough hiding. Show yourself."

A tall figure in black stepped from behind a signpost, removing his cap.

Vivian’s breath caught.

Nathan Prescott—Ethan Blackwood’s closest friend, Olivia Sinclair’s staunch defender, and heir to the Prescott fortune—had been tailing her the entire time.
###Chapter 275

Nathan Prescott's face burned with humiliation when Vivian Lockhart caught him. He swore under his breath, frustration boiling over.

"Damn it! How the hell did you spot me? I was being stealthy—I even stopped breathing!"

Vivian crossed her arms, giving him a slow once-over before rolling her eyes. "It's the middle of the day, and you're dressed like a shadow. Plus, you were practically breathing down my neck. And that hiding spot? Seriously?"

Nathan scratched his nose, realizing how ridiculous his attempt had been. "Aren't pregnant women supposed to be forgetful? You're way too sharp for that."

Vivian's breath hitched.

"Who said anything about pregnancy?" she shot back, forcing a laugh. "You're the one acting crazy here!"

Normally, Nathan would’ve snapped, but he bit his tongue. He had a reason for tailing her, and he wasn’t about to lose his cool now.

"Cut the act," he muttered. "I saw you at the hospital. Obstetrics wing. You’re pregnant."

Vivian’s pulse spiked. If he knew, then Ethan Blackwood would find out. And that would be a disaster.

"Relax," Nathan said firmly. "I’m not running to Ethan with this."

That surprised her. Since when did Nathan Prescott keep secrets? Something was off.

"Look," he continued, "Ethan just finalized the divorce. If he finds out you’re already carrying Liam Osborne’s kid, it’ll wreck him. I’m not doing that to my best friend."

His words clicked. Nathan assumed the baby wasn’t Ethan’s. Good. Let him think that.

A smirk tugged at her lips. "Exactly. That’s why I’m keeping it quiet. Liam and I are leaving soon. No need to rub my happy ending in Ethan’s face."

"Damn right," Nathan growled. "If you’ve got any sense, you’ll stay quiet until Ethan moves on. Otherwise, I’ll make your life hell."

Vivian nodded solemnly, though amusement flickered in her eyes. Nathan, for all his bluster, was oddly loyal.

But why had he been following her in the first place?

"Spill it," she demanded. "Why were you stalking me? If you don’t give me a good reason, I might just accidentally let something slip to Ethan."
###Chapter 276

Nathan cleared his throat awkwardly.

The usual arrogance was gone from his demeanor. Instead, he shifted uncomfortably, avoiding direct eye contact.

Of course he felt humiliated. He was about to beg a favor from the very woman he despised most.

"Are you free? I'll buy you coffee."

The words came out stiffly after a long pause.

Vivian arched a brow, amused. "Mr. Prescott, since when are we friends? Should I be worried about poison in my cup?"

She knew exactly how Nathan viewed her—with disdain, as nothing more than an irritating obstacle.

Yet here he was, extending an olive branch.

Predictably, his handsome face darkened. "Do you really think I'm that petty?"

"Aren't you?"

His jaw clenched. "Listen—I may want you gone, but I'd never resort to something so underhanded. At worst, I'd curse you under my breath. Drugging someone? That's beneath me."

The sheer indignation in his voice was almost comical.

Vivian decided to spare him further torment. "Fine. I'll humor you this once."

They headed to the nearby Starlight Café.

"Miss Lockhart!"

Evelyn frowned, casting a suspicious glare at Nathan.

Vivian patted her arm reassuringly. "It's alright. He's a friend."

Friend?

The word hit Nathan like a shockwave. His pulse stuttered.

She called him a friend.

After all his snide remarks and open hostility, she still offered him that label.

A strange warmth spread through his chest, followed immediately by shame.

"You can't be too careful these days," Evelyn muttered, eyeing Nathan with open distrust. "Especially with men like him. He looks like trouble."

Nathan's eye twitched. "Excuse me? I donate to charity every year. I help old ladies cross the street. I've rescued drowning kids and adopted stray cats. How am I not a good person?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily speechless.

Vivian bit back a laugh at his earnest defense.

Grabbing his arm, she tugged him toward the café. "Come on. I believe you're a saint."

Nathan froze.

Her fingers against his sleeve sent an odd jolt through him.

For once, he had nothing sarcastic to say.
###Chapter 277

What was Vivian playing at? Why did she suddenly grab his arm like that?

Her fingers were delicate, her touch feather-light. It sent an unexpected warmth through him.

Nathan's thoughts spiraled. His pulse kicked up.

He jerked his arm away, scowling. "What's your game? Boundaries exist, Vivian. I might be irresistible, but keep your hands to yourself."

Vivian laughed, unfazed. "Fine, fine. I'll behave. Mr. Prescott, do tone down the charm, won't you?"

She'd only ever known his sharp tongue. This playful side was new—and oddly refreshing.

Maybe having him as an ally wouldn't be so bad.

They settled by the window at Starfee. Nathan ordered an iced black coffee; Vivian chose a steaming cappuccino.

The first sip was perfection. She exhaled, tension melting.

"Out with it. What do you need?"

No point dancing around it.

Nathan choked on his drink. "How did you—?"

"Please. You'd never buy me coffee unless you wanted something. Normally, you'd just insult me and leave."

His gaze sharpened, reassessing her. "I underestimated you. Thought you were just another pretty face coasting on the Blackwood name. No wonder Ethan's so taken with you."

She scoffed. Taken? Ethan only ever glared at her.

"Flattery won't work. Spit it out. Whether I help depends on my mood."

Nathan dragged a hand through his hair. "I'm tangled in a lawsuit. Only one lawyer in Newport City can win it—Julian Montgomery from Blackwood Legal."

"Ah." She snapped her fingers. "So you messed up and need Julian to clean it. Correct?"

"No!" He slammed his cup down. "A woman died at my club. The family's suing me for negligence. Someone set me up—they refused settlements, got police protection. I can't even bribe my way out."

He looked wrecked. Desperate.

Vivian tapped her chin. "Cause of death?"

"Overdose. She injected too much, her system crashed." His jaw clenched. "Her bad choices aren't my fault!"

"Legally? They are. If your club supplied the drugs or encouraged use, you're criminally liable."

"Enough!" He leaned in, voice raw. "That's why I'm begging. Julian's won cases like this before. Get him to take mine."

Pride clearly cost him to ask.

Vivian smiled. "I'll help. On one condition."
###Chapter 278

Nathan's eyes sparkled with renewed hope.

"Name your terms," he said eagerly. "Whatever you want—just help me win this case."

Vivian didn't mince words. "I want a thirty-year lease on your family's southern plot in Newport City."

The Prescotts were one of the Elite Eight, their fortune built on real estate. Though they specialized in just one industry, their wealth was formidable.

Years ago, strategic connections had secured them vast lands, leading to luxury developments and commercial hubs.

But the southern plot?

Fifteen hundred square feet of untouched wilderness, too remote for profitable development. Overgrown and abandoned, it had been a financial burden for years.

The Prescott family held onto it only because selling during the market slump would mean massive losses.

Vivian's request was... unexpected.

"Why that plot?" Nathan frowned, sipping his coffee. "It's a money pit. No investor would touch it."

She smirked. At least he’s honest enough to admit his family’s liabilities.

"That's my business. Do we have a deal or not?"

Nathan exhaled. "If you really want it, take it. But I’m warning you—it’s a bad investment. My family has better properties if—"

"No." Her voice was firm. "Just that one. Agree, and Julian Montgomery will sign on as your defense attorney today."

"Fine." He shrugged. "I’ll lease it to you at cost. But don’t come crying when you can’t turn a profit."

"Deal." She lifted her cup in a toast.

Surprisingly easy. She’d expected Nathan to be the toughest negotiation, but he’d folded faster than the others.

Never judge a book by its cover.

Nathan studied her, curiosity flickering in his gaze. "You know… you look better since the divorce. That meek rich-wife act you used to pull? Annoying as hell."

Vivian arched a brow. "Funny. My life improved the second I left Nathaniel. People actually treat me like a person now."

Back then, she’d bent over backward to please everyone—only to be met with disdain.

Now?

The maids who sneered at her bowed their heads. Her former mother-in-law, Eleanor, no longer dared to insult her. Even Nathan, who once rolled his eyes at her existence, was chatting with her like an equal.

"Turns out, Nathaniel was the bad luck charm all along," she mused bitterly. "Cut him loose, and suddenly, life works."

Nathan snorted. "He’d lose his mind if he heard that."

Then, quieter: "He’s into you now, but you’re over him. Timing’s a bitch."

Vivian scoffed. "He’s not into me. It’s just possessiveness."

"Maybe." Nathan sighed. "The man’s clueless about love. But one thing’s clear—he’s obsessed. Asked me for dating tips last week. Took notes."

Her lips twisted. "Let me guess—he thinks he can ‘win me back’?"

Nathan smirked. "Oh, he’s definitely trying."
###Chapter 279

Vivian choked on her coffee, hastily wiping her lips. "You're joking, right? Nathaniel Blackwood—the man who's colder than ice—asked you for dating advice? This has to be some kind of prank!"

"I'm dead serious." Nathan Prescott smirked. "I gave him my best techniques. And judging by how he's acting now, I'd say he's learned a lot."

He launched into an animated explanation of his so-called foolproof seduction methods. The more Vivian listened, the more she recognized Nathaniel's recent bizarre behavior. She groaned, torn between exasperation and reluctant amusement.

"So that's why he made a new account to message me every day. And the money offers. And the way he talks to other women—" She let out a sharp laugh. "There’s an actual playbook behind it!"

At first, she had been furious with Nathaniel. But realizing he was just blindly following Nathan’s ridiculous advice made him seem almost... endearing. Her anger fizzled out, replaced by reluctant pity.

"Look, he claims he's doing all this to get you to drop the lawsuit against Cassandra," Nathan admitted. "But between you and me? I think he actually cares. That man has pride. If he didn’t give a damn, he wouldn’t humiliate himself like this."

Because of Cassandra.

Vivian’s brief moment of softness vanished. She shrugged, voice flat. "Doesn’t matter. It’s over now."

"True." Nathan nodded. "With Olivia breaking things off with Dominic, I wouldn’t be surprised if Nathaniel runs back to her. They were crazy about each other back in the day."

Vivian blinked, then forced a smile. "Good for them."

Nathan clapped her shoulder. "Anyway, water under the bridge. You and Liam seem happy. And hey—you’ve got a kid together. That’s moving faster than I expected."

Vivian didn’t respond.

She just smiled.

Maybe this was the best ending.

As predicted, Julian Montgomery was as sharp as ever. He won Nathan’s case with ruthless efficiency.

The key evidence? The victim had a pre-existing heart condition. Her death was primarily due to her illness, with the drug she’d taken being a secondary factor. Nathan’s company was fined and temporarily shut down for investigation—but he still paid the family a hefty settlement out of guilt.

"Murderers! You’re all murderers!"

"That judge is corrupt! That lawyer is a monster! My daughter will haunt you!"

The victim’s parents wailed in the courtroom, their grief twisting into rage.

Vivian, free from her own legal troubles, attended the trial. So did Nathaniel.

They didn’t speak. Didn’t even glance at each other.

As soon as the verdict was read, she turned to leave with Julian—only for Nathan to block their path.

"Dinner’s on me," he announced, grinning. "You two saved my ass. Least I can do is feed you."

Vivian opened her mouth to refuse, but Julian cut in. "Damn right. This case was a nightmare. You owe us steak."

So the four of them walked out together.

Unseen by them, the dead girl’s vengeful gaze burned into their backs.
###Chapter 280

The upscale Italian restaurant they chose had an ambiance of understated elegance, with soft jazz playing in the background.

Initially, Nathan Prescott and Julian Montgomery had been at odds, but after winning that high-profile lawsuit together, they'd formed an unexpected bond.

"Mr. Montgomery, let me propose a toast." Nathan raised his wine ss with a grin. "Without your brilliant defense, I'd be facing my father's wrath right now. He might've actually disowned me this time."

Julian, ever mindful of his boss Vivian Lockhart, quickly deflected the praise. "Don't thank me. I'm just following Ms. Lockhart's directives. None of this would've happened without her approval."

"Exactly! A toast to Vivian!"

Julian turned to Vivian with a playful smirk. "I won't underestimate you as just some young socialite anymore. How about I call you Viv from now on?"

He began humming a tune under his breath. "Viv, my shining star... lighting up my darkest night..."

Vivian's face lit up with genuine delight, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

"That was lovely, Nathan. I had no idea you could sing like that."

"Of course!" Nathan puffed up with pride. "Back in college, I was known as the romance ballad king. Women swooned over my voice. I even wrote songs for a platinum-selling artist. Isn't that right, Ethan?"

He nudged Ethan Blackwood who sat beside him, meticulously cutting his steak with precise, elegant movements. The CEO's expression remained icy, his aristocratic features giving nothing away.

The knife clinked sharply against the plate as Ethan replied without looking up, "With that mouth, you should've been a radio host."

"Ethan, come on—" Nathan's smile faltered. "Since when did my chattiness bother you? What's got you in such a mood?"

"I'm not in a mood."

The way Ethan sawed through his steak suggested otherwise. The usually tender cut seemed particularly tough tonight.

"Clearly you are." Nathan persisted. "Jealous I'm getting along so well with Viv?"

Ethan's glacial re made Nathan instinctively lean back. The unspoken threat was clear: One more word and the steak knife might find a new target.

Vivian quickly took a sip of her sparkling water to hide her flustered expression. Could Ethan actually be jealous? No, that couldn't be...

Setting down his utensils with deliberate calm, Ethan wiped his mouth and fixed Nathan with a look. "Weren't you the one who found her insufferable? What's with the sudden change of heart?"

"That's not fair," Nathan protested. "Viv and I understand each other now. We're kindred spirits—right, Viv?"

"Absolutely." Vivian played along with an amused nod. "That coffee you bought me sealed our friendship. Consider us bonded for life."

What really mattered was Nathan's unexpected generosity—leasing her that prime 1,500 sq ft commercial space at well below market rate. In this cutthroat business world, such genuine kindness was rare indeed.
###Chapter 281

"Tch!"

Ethan's face darkened further, his lips curling in undisguised contempt.

The reason for his anger? Even he couldn't explain it.

Every time he saw Vivian getting close to another man, this inexplicable fury would bubble up inside him.

"What's with the attitude? Man, you claim you're not jealous but your face tells a different story—"

Nathan smirked. "I'll admit, I used to dislike Viv. Back then, I thought she was just some gold-digger clinging to you, a delicate flower that could only survive under the Blackwood family's protection. I believed she was holding you back from finding real happiness—"

"But now that you're divorced, I see how capable she truly is. Not only does she run Blackwood Legal and Lockhart Enterprises flawlessly, she's even acquiring land from me—probably for some ambitious project. Far from being fragile, she's more like a resilient, venomous blossom!"

Before Nathan could finish singing Vivian's praises, Julian chimed in enthusiastically. "Damn right. Our boss is brilliant, resourceful, and detail-oriented. All three partners at Blackwood Legal now follow her lead willingly. I've never seen the firm's employees so motivated before—it's like the place finally woke up from hibernation. All thanks to our boss's incredible leadership!"

Vivian flushed slightly at the compliments. She waved a dismissive hand. "It's nothing special. Just channeling my newfound freedom into work, that's all—"

Ethan zeroed in on the crucial detail amidst the praise. His brow furrowed as he demanded, "You got land from Nathan? What for?"

"That's classified information, Mr. Blackwood."

"Don't tell me you're building a manufacturing plant?"

"How perceptive. But... only half correct."

Vivian's lips curved mysteriously. "Lockhart Enterprises won't remain just a manufacturer forever. We're expanding into core business territories."

"You've lost your mind!"

Ethan looked at her like she'd grown a second head. His voice turned icy. "Do you even comprehend the challenges you'll face? The risks involved?"

The barrage of questions left Vivian momentarily speechless.

She couldn't fathom why he was so worked up. Was he afraid Lockhart Enterprises would grow powerful enough to challenge Blackwood Group's market dominance? Talk about insecurity!

Nathan couldn't resist teasing. "Bro, not your circus, not your monkeys. Need I remind you—you're divorced now. Whether she wants to start a business or date someone new, it's none of your concern. The risks? The consequences? Not your problem!"

"Right. Why should I care?"

Ethan stood abruptly, his expression unreadable. "Finished eating. Goodbye."

With that, he strode out.

The atmosphere instantly turned awkward.

Nathan offered Vivian and Julian an apologetic look. "Sorry about that. He's not usually this temperamental."

Vivian and Julian exchanged knowing glances. "No explanation needed. We're familiar with his... quirks."

Dinner continued with the trio taking turns roasting Ethan's behavior.

After the meal, they went their separate ways. Julian and Vivian headed in one direction while Nathan happened to be going the same way as Vivian, so she accepted a ride home with him.

Engrossed in lively conversation, neither noticed the dark figure watching them from a distance—or the impending storm brewing on the horizon.
###Chapter 282

The sleek black sedan pulled up to the gated entrance of Lockhart Manor.

Nathan Prescott cut the engine and whistled low. "Impressive digs, though a bit... isolated. Rumor has it the last owners fled because of ghost sightings. Doesn't spook you living alone in this mausoleum?"

Vivian Lockhart's lips curved into an amused smile. "Ghosts? Please. The living terrify me far more than the dead ever could." Her fingers clicked the seatbelt release. "And I stopped being afraid of people long ago."

As she reached for the door handle, Nathan caught her wrist. "No invitation for tea? After that harrowing drive through rush hour traffic?" His grin was all boyish charm.

Vivian turned, the afternoon light catching in her auburn hair. "Earl Grey. Imported." Her smile hit him like a physical blow - that rare, unguarded expression transforming her sharp features into something breathtaking.

Nathan suddenly found the leather steering wheel fascinating. "Well. Since you're twisting my arm..."

The manor grounds had undergone a metamorphosis under Vivian and Evelyn Whitmore's care. Where weeds once choked the pathways, orderly rows of lavender now bordered flagstone walks. The air hummed with bees drunk on nectar.

"Christ," Nathan breathed. "From the road it looks like some Gothic horror set. But this?" He gestured at the tiered rose gardens. "This belongs in a fucking fairy tale."

He flopped onto a wrought-iron bench with theatrical exhaustion. "Seriously, any spare bedrooms? I'll pay triple the Ritz-Carlton's penthouse rate." His grin turned wheedling. "Corporate litigation's eating my soul. Your gardens scream 'healing retreat.'"

Vivian rolled her eyes but moved toward the tea service. "Your shamelessness remains unparalleled."

Evelyn's absence left the manor preternaturally quiet. Yet Vivian found Nathan's presence oddly... uncomplicated. No calculating silences. No landmines in every conversation. Just easy companionship - a novelty after years navigating Nathaniel Blackwood's emotional minefields.

The tea ritual unfolded with practiced grace. Boiling water over loose leaves. Precisely three minutes' steep. The fragrant steam curled between them as Vivian poured into bone china cups.

Nathan took an appreciative sip. "Damn. You moonlight as a tea sommelier?"

"Among other things." Vivian's smile was enigmatic. She owed him this small hospitality - his below-market lease on the warehouse space had saved her fledgling operation.

Upstairs, the solarium's floor-to-ceiling windows framed the estate's crowning glory: an acre of sunflowers turning their golden faces toward the late afternoon light.

"Those are Blackwood Estate-level blooms," Nathan observed. "Nathaniel mentioned your sunflower obsession. What's the appeal? Some deep symbolic meaning?"

Vivian watched a bumblebee navigate the pollen-heavy blossoms. "They're stubborn bastards. Drought, poor soil, doesn't matter - they'll stretch toward every scrap of sunlight." Her fingertip traced the cup's gilt edge. "I respect that kind of relentless optimism."

Nathan's gaze turned speculative. "And the flower language?"

"Wouldn't you like to know." The words came out lighter than intended. The tea leaves swirled as she gave her cup a thoughtful turn. Outside, the sunflowers stood sentinel - a living wall between her present and a past she'd vowed never to revisit.
###Chapter 283

Nathan pressed further.

Vivian gave a mysterious smile, choosing to sip her tea rather than respond.

"Fine, if you won't tell me, I'll find out myself."

Nathan pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen as he searched. The answer appeared instantly. "The language of sunflowers means 'You're the only one in my heart'..." His eyes widened. "Is that how you feel about Ethan?"

Vivian turned her gaze to the golden field, letting the silence speak for her.

Ever persistent, Nathan pushed harder. "So you actually loved him that deeply? I thought you were just after his wealth and status!"

"Correction," Vivian set down her teacup with deliberate calm. "I used to love him that much. Now I've woken up from that fantasy." Her fingers traced the rim of her cup. "The ocean's vast, Nathan. My heart's an empty vessel now - ready for the right person to claim it."

"Wait a minute." Nathan caught the implication immediately. "You're saying you haven't met 'the right person' yet?"

Vivian's throat tightened. She'd slipped up. As far as Nathan knew, she should be carrying Liam's child. How could there be no "right person"?

"Don't overthink it." Nathan waved a hand, his voice surprisingly gentle. "These things happen in the moment. Completely normal." He leaned forward, suddenly serious. "Between you and me? You and Liam are pure physical chemistry. The guy's practically a child. My advice? Terminate and walk away."

"I'll... consider that." Relief flooded through her.

She'd been scrambling for explanations, but Nathan had handed her one.

"I need time to think about termination," she said carefully. "Which means you must keep this pregnancy secret. For old times' sake." Her eyes turned sharp. "Especially from Ethan."

"My lips are sealed."

Nathan fell quiet then, something unreadable flickering in his expression. After a long pause, he asked casually, "So if Ethan's in your past, and Liam was just... a mistake, does that mean your heart's truly free now?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "You could say that."

"And this empty heart of yours..." Nathan's voice dropped. "Does that mean someone new could... fill it?"

"If the right man comes along?" A wistful smile touched her lips. "I'd like to experience real love this time."

Despite love's betrayals, her hope remained unbroken. She still believed. Still waited.

"Then maybe I—"

Vivian suddenly tensed. "Nathan," she interrupted sharply. "Do you smell that?"
###Chapter 284

Nathan inhaled sharply, then shrugged. "Nothing. Just tea."

"Wrong!"

Vivian's instincts were razor-sharp. Her nose wrinkled. "That's smoke. And it's getting stronger."

"Smoke?"

Nathan sniffed again. This time, he caught the acrid scent, but brushed it off. "Relax. Probably your neighbor burning burgers."

"I'm checking."

She couldn't ignore the unease coiling in her gut. In seconds, she was out of the tea room.

Then—a gasp.

Flames licked up the first floor, devouring the staircase. Thick smoke choked the air.

"Holy hell—since when?!" Nathan barked.

The fire roared louder, walls groaning under the heat. The wooden stairs were already collapsing.

"Move. Now." Panic edged his voice. He dropped to one knee. "Get on. I'll get us down."

Vivian froze.

She hadn't expected this. In crisis, most men ran. Yet here he was—offering his back first.

A debt she wouldn't forget.

"Look at the stairs," she said evenly. "We'd be ash before we hit the third step."

"Then what? Sit here and roast? Damn it, Viv—this isn't a drill!"

Sweat slicked his temples. Every second, the fire crept closer.

She yanked him into the tea room, slamming the door. The space was large, windows wide. Their only exit.

No hysterics. Just action.

She ripped fabric, soaked it, pressed one to her face. Tossed him the other. "Windows. Now."

Nathan lunged to the ledge. The drop wasn't fatal—with care, he could make it.

"Smart." He crouched again. "But we're out of time. Get on."

"Not happening." Her jaw set. "You go. Bring help."

Carrying her would slow him. Risk them both.

"Bullshit! I don't leave pregnant women to die!" His voice cracked. "I climb cliffs for fun. Trust me."

The door blackened. Embers spat through cracks.

Vivian's hands cradled her stomach. Two heartbeats. No gambles.

She climbed onto his back, arms locking around his neck. "Don't drop us."

Nathan exhaled hard. "We're getting out. All three of us."
###Chapter 285

Nathan Prescott climbed through the shattered window with Vivian Lockhart clinging to his back.

Each movement was agonizingly slow under their combined weight. His muscles screamed with the effort of maintaining his grip.

Flames licked at their heels while thick smoke choked the air around them. The inferno roared like a living beast hunting its prey.

Sweat poured down Nathan's face in rivulets, soaking through his shirt. His entire body trembled from exertion.

Veins stood out sharply on his flushed forehead. His breathing came in ragged gasps as his strength rapidly depleted.

They were suspended between the first and second floors - fire above them, concrete below.

Without Vivian's added weight, Nathan could have leaped to safety instantly. But with her precious cargo, every movement required deliberate caution.

Trapped in limbo, their options dwindled by the second.

Vivian's voice cracked with emotion. "Nathan...if you can't hold on, just jump. Save yourself!"

"Don't be ridiculous!" Nathan growled through clenched teeth.

His arms shook violently as he scanned their surroundings. Finally spotting a potential escape route, he rasped, "Listen carefully - I'm putting you on that AC unit. You can climb down from there."

"But what about you? There's only room for one!" Vivian protested.

"Stop arguing!" Nathan snapped. "I can't hold on much longer with your weight."

With a final burst of strength, he maneuvered Vivian onto the narrow metal platform.

Vivian didn't hesitate. Every second counted now. She carefully lowered herself toward the ground.

Normally this descent would have been simple for someone of her athleticism. But protecting the lives growing inside her required extreme caution.

"I made it!" Vivian cried as her feet touched solid ground.

The open air provided some relief from the suffocating smoke. Flames still licked at the perimeter, but the immediate danger had lessened.

"Good! I'm right behind you!" Nathan called down.

As he prepared to jump, disaster struck. The weakened AC unit collapsed beneath him.

Nathan crashed to the ground with a sickening thud, the metal casing pinning his leg.

"Damn it!" he cursed through gritted teeth.

Vivian rushed to his side. "Come on, we're getting out of here!"

"Leave me!" Nathan commanded. "The fire's spreading too fast!"

"Shut up and help me!" Vivian countered fiercely.

She hauled him upright, their bodies swaying unsteadily as they stumbled forward.

Nathan's protests grew weaker with each step. "This is...humiliating...being rescued...by a woman..."

Through the thickening smoke, Vivian's slender frame seemed to radiate impossible strength. The sight stirred something deep in Nathan's chest.

"Save your breath!" Vivian panted. "I won't abandon you, just like you didn't abandon me! We're getting out of this together!"

As her determined words echoed in his ears, Nathan's vision darkened. Consciousness slipped away as the world faded to black.
###Chapter 286

Vivian hauled Nathan's unconscious body through the roaring flames, barely making it out alive.

She collapsed onto the grass, gasping for air. The cool breeze against her skin felt like a miracle.

Life had never felt so precious.

Sirens wailed in the distance as fire trucks screeched to a halt. Paramedics rushed toward them with a stretcher.

"I'm fine," Vivian rasped, pushing herself up. "Help him first. His leg—it's broken. He needs surgery now!"

Her voice cracked. "He got hurt saving me. You have to fix him. Please."

She'd checked his injuries. The right calf bone was visibly dislocated. If he never walked again...

The medic nodded firmly. "We'll do everything we can."

They loaded Nathan onto the ambulance. Vivian turned back toward the smoldering ruins of her home—and froze.

Something important was still inside.

She lunged toward the flames.

"Ma'am, stop!" A firefighter grabbed her arm. "It's suicide to go back in there!"

"My things!" Vivian fought against his grip, wild-eyed. "I have to get them!"

"Nothing's worth your life—"

"Let me go!"

Tires screeched. A black sports car skidded to a stop.

Ethan Blackwood stepped out, his icy glare cutting through the chaos.

"Enough."

That single word silenced everything.

The moment Vivian saw him, the dam broke. Tears streamed down her soot-streaked face.

"They won't let me go back in!" She slammed her fists against his chest. "My parents' things are still there!"

Ethan caught her wrists, pulling her against him. His voice dropped to a murmur. "Tell me where. I'll get them."

Vivian went still. "My bedroom. Second floor. Dad's painting and Mom's map..."

Ethan handed her off to a paramedic. Then he grabbed a wet towel and fire extinguisher.

And ran straight into hell.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Firefighters shouted after him. "The structure's unstable!"

Vivian's blood turned to ice. "Ethan, no! Forget the things—just come back!"

But he was already gone, swallowed by smoke and flames.
###Chapter 287

The painting hung just high enough to escape the flames.

Ethan Blackwood grabbed the fire extinguisher, spraying the surrounding flames before carefully retrieving the artwork.

But Vivian Lockhart's precious "map" remained trapped in the upstairs bedroom—now an inferno.

"Ethan, get back here! Don't you dare go in again!"

Vivian's voice cracked from screaming.

She couldn't stay put any longer. She'd risk the flames herself if necessary.

Then—smoke billowed as Ethan emerged, cradling her father's beloved painting.

His sculpted features were smudged with soot matching hers. His designer shirt hung in charred tatters, angry burns marking his hands.

He met her gaze, gently presenting the salvaged artwork. "The map... I couldn't reach it."

Tears streamed down Vivian's face at the sight of his battered sincerity. Words failed her.

"You reckless idiot! If you'd died in there—" Her voice broke. "I wouldn't survive losing you. Do you understand?"

Abandoning restraint, she flung her arms around his neck, clinging like he might vanish. Like she'd reclaimed something priceless.

Ethan stood frozen, the painting still in his grip.

Moments ago, he'd been burning alive. Now electricity coursed through him at her touch.

In four years of marriage, Vivian had never held him like this—never unleashed the full force of her passion. Always so careful. Always holding back.

Now her love scorched hotter than the blaze behind them.

"Stop crying," he murmured, uncharacteristically gentle. "Nathaniel Blackwood doesn't die easily. Fire and water both failed today."

Vivian suddenly realized her outburst. She jerked away, wiping tears.

"Right. You're practically unkillable—like some mutant cockroach. Wasted my tears."

Ethan's expression darkened. "This is my thanks?"

"How else should I thank you? Throw myself at you?"

"I wouldn't object."

Tension crackled between them—new and intoxicating.

Later, in Ethan's Lamborghini, Vivian studied the rescued painting with a frown.

Not a singe marred Claude Monet's "The Night Shepherd."

"My father adored this piece," she whispered. "Collectors offered fifteen million during our bankruptcy. He refused every bid." Her voice thickened. "Thank you, Ethan. I never expected such loyalty... from a friend."

"A friend?" he echoed coldly.

At a red light, Ethan yanked the parking brake. His smoldering gaze pinned her. "Earlier—did you mean it?"

Vivian's cheeks flushed. "Mean what?"

"That you couldn't live if I died."

"O-of course not!" She looked away. "Just... dramatic timing."

"Is that so?"

The light turned green. Instead of driving, Ethan's hand captured hers—

###Chapter 288

Vivian froze. Her puzzled gaze locked onto Ethan's profile, her body rigid with tension.

A visible flush spread across her porcelain cheeks.

What... What did that mean?

Ethan appeared completely unbothered. Keeping his eyes on the road, he murmured, "My mistake. Wrong gear."

His hand moved casually from her thigh to the gearshift, smoothly transitioning the car from neutral to drive.

The sleek sports car accelerated down the highway.

It moved as fast as Vivian's pounding heart!

Only after several minutes did realization dawn - had she just been... teased?

"Ethan Blackwood, was that your idea of flirting?"

She turned sharply toward the driver, her cheeks puffing in indignation like an irritated chipmunk. Adorable.

Ethan's lips quirked as he glanced at her. Instead of answering, he countered, "What do you think?"

Vivian tapped her chin thoughtfully before declaring with mock seriousness, "I think you're attempting to flirt, but your technique needs serious work!"

If he wanted to hold her hand, he should've just done it.

Wrong gear? Might as well claim he'd gone blind!

When he remained silent, she pressed on boldly. "I thought you consulted Nathan about courting women? These amateur moves suggest you're a terrible student!"

Ethan's jaw tightened. "Nathan Prescott, you're dead. Selling me out like this..."

The humiliation of seeking dating advice at his age was bad enough. But having his target informed? Unforgivable.

His expression sobered suddenly. "How is that idiot anyway? Medics said his injuries were severe."

Vivian's playful mood evaporated. "Compound fracture in his right leg from the falling unit. He pushed me out of harm's way. I owe him everything—"

"Like hell you do!"

Ethan's grip on the wheel turned white-knuckled. "Stop claiming responsibility for everything! If he demanded you in repayment, would you comply?"

"What kind of question is that? He's Nathan!"

Vivian stared at Ethan's stormy profile, baffled by his sudden anger.

Nathan had saved her life. Was gratitude so unreasonable?

Tension thickened the air like approaching thunder. Neither spoke.

Vivian didn't ask their destination. This moody man was a live wire lately.

That fleeting moment of tenderness? Clearly her imagination.

Finally, Ethan broke the silence. "Don't be naive. Favors between men and women complicate everything. If anyone repays this debt, it'll be me."

"You—"

Vivian gaped.

Streetlights strobed across Ethan's sharp features as the car sped forward - light and shadow playing across his face like his mercurial moods.

This made no sense. If male-female favors were problematic, and he settled her debt to Nathan... what did she owe Ethan then?

Turning toward the window, Vivian suddenly recognized their route. "Stop the car! I'm not going back to Blackwood Villa!"

That gilded cage had imprisoned her for four years. A place of shattered hopes and endless humiliation. She'd sworn never to return.
###Chapter 289

Ethan kept driving without hesitation. His voice was icy. "Lockhart Manor is gone. If you don't return to Blackwood Villa, where exactly do you plan to go?"

"Anywhere but Blackwood Villa!"

Vivian's response was absolute. "I'll rent or buy a place. This world is vast enough for me to find shelter."

"Unnecessary."

Ethan's tone brooked no argument. "You still own half of Blackwood Villa, which makes it your home too. In a few days, I'll transfer the remaining ownership to you. Then it'll be entirely yours to keep or sell as you wish."

Hearing this, Vivian decided against further protest.

After all, Blackwood Villa was worth over a hundred million. Ethan was essentially gifting her a fortune. Arguing would seem ungrateful.

Still, she couldn't resist muttering, "That's not what you said when you kicked me out."

"What was that?"

Ethan's sharp question made it clear he'd caught her words.

Vivian quickly shook her head. "Nothing. I said Blackwood Villa is beautiful and spacious. I like it very much."

"Better."

Ethan returned his attention to the road without pressing further.

With Cassandra Delacroix gone, Blackwood Villa had finally regained its peace.

What stunned Vivian most was the garden - where roses once dominated, sunflowers now bloomed vibrantly, mirroring those at Lockhart Manor exactly as she preferred.

The servants who'd once mistreated her now rushed to greet her return, some even weeping with relief.

"Thank heavens Mrs. Blackwood is back! I knew you'd return!"

Beatrice Thornton, the head housekeeper, exclaimed tearfully.

Vivian smirked. "How touching, Beatrice. Your welcome rivals your enthusiasm when you threw me out. How... generous."

Beatrice flushed crimson. "Please don't mock me, Mrs. Blackwood. I know I overstepped before. I'll accept any punishment if you'll forgive me!"

"Forgiveness granted. No punishment needed. But are you truly this repentant? You'd do anything for my return?"

Vivian's smile turned enigmatic.

"Absolutely! Anything!"

"Then pack your things. Someone new will take your position."

Vivian's expression hardened instantly.

"But—"

Beatrice paled, caught off guard.

She never imagined the once-gentle Vivian would strike first upon returning to the Blackwood family.

"You refuse?"

"No, it's not that—"

Beatrice scrambled behind Eleanor Whitmore. "The truth is, I serve under Madam Eleanor's orders. Dismissing me would show disrespect."

"Ah, using my former mother-in-law as leverage."

"That's not my intention—"

Beatrice thought Vivian wouldn't dare defy Eleanor.

Ethan spoke then. "From today, this villa belongs solely to Miss Lockhart. Choosing staff is her privilege. You're dismissed."
###Chapter 290

Beatrice never expected Nathaniel to be so fiercely protective of Vivian. Now, she didn’t dare utter another word. Silently, she gathered her belongings and left.

Before stepping out, she seized the moment when Nathaniel wasn’t looking to hiss at Vivian. "Don’t think you’ve won! You’re nothing but a discarded ex-wife. You showed me no mercy today? Just wait—I’ll make sure you regret it. Your peace ends here!"

Vivian smirked. "I knew you’d never change. You’d never willingly obey me. Good riddance. One more complaint, and you won’t even get your severance."

"Mark my words, Vivian Lockhart!"

Beatrice shot her a venomous glare before storming off.

The second she left Blackwood Villa, she dialed Eleanor.

"Madam, you must avenge this injustice! Vivian Lockhart is ruthless! She’s enchanted the young master and taken over the villa. Not only did she throw me out, but I’ve also heard she’s responsible for Cassandra’s death—"

For thirty minutes, Beatrice spun lies, eighty percent of them pure fabrication.

Eleanor’s rage boiled over. Her fists clenched. "I knew she was behind Briar’s death! My poor grandchild, robbed of life before taking a single breath! Vivian Lockhart, you’ll pay for this!"

After moving back into Blackwood Villa, Vivian didn’t just dismiss the housekeeper—she let go of every servant.

Now, only she and Nathaniel remained in the sprawling thousand-square-meter estate. The emptiness made their voices echo.

Nathaniel frowned. "If you fire everyone, who’ll maintain this place? Are you hiring new staff?"

Vivian shook her head. "I have hands. I can manage. Besides, I prefer the quiet."

Nathaniel nodded. "With just the two of us, it’ll certainly be quiet."

Vivian arched a brow. "Didn’t you say this villa is solely mine? If you’re staying, I’ll leave."

A man and woman living alone together—even in a mansion—was scandal fuel. She cared about her reputation, even if he didn’t.

Nathaniel hadn’t expected such wariness. His expression cooled. "I remember how eagerly you used to wait for me. You’d prepare feasts and sit on the garden swing all afternoon, just hoping I’d come home—"

"Stop!"

Mortification burned through Vivian. She wished the ground would swallow her.

Nathaniel wasn’t exaggerating. She had been that foolish once, blinded by love. Back then, shattered by family tragedy, she’d withdrawn from the world, dedicating herself to being the perfect Blackwood wife. He had been her entire universe.

She had waited on that swing countless nights. When he didn’t return, she’d stay awake, aching for him—

Now, the memory made her sick.

"Please, spare me the past. If you keep going, I might bite my tongue off."

She took a steadying breath. "Yes, I was obsessed with you. But people change. The moment you threw me out without hesitation, that love died."

"I want you gone now as fiercely as I once longed for you to stay. If you remain, I’ll leave."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

After a long pause, he nodded. "Fine. But look at me. Let me shower and change first. Then I’ll visit Oliver at the hospital. Acceptable?"

At that moment, he looked like he’d crawled out of a coal mine.
###Chapter 291

Vivian wasn't faring much better herself.

This wasn't the time for stubbornness. She took deep breaths, forcing herself to remain composed.

"Alright, let's clean up and head to the hospital together."

They retreated to separate bathrooms for quick showers.

The awkward reality hit them - neither lived here, meaning no spare clothes were available. They emerged wrapped only in towels.

Vivian stepped out first, searching for something casual to wear.

Nathaniel had the same idea.

Their paths crossed in this compromising state.

His gaze traveled boldly from her damp hair down to her bare feet.

Vivian returned the favor without shame, her fingers itching to trace those sculpted muscles.

"Been hitting the gym again, Nathaniel? Those abs could rival a professional trainer's."

Memories flooded back of caring for his "paralyzed" form during his fake quadriplegia days.

He arched an eyebrow. "You're in better shape than I remembered. Though that belly could use some work."

Vivian clenched her jaw.

Of course her stomach showed - she carried twins!

And what did he mean "better than remembered"? As if he hadn't seen every inch before!

Their clothing search was interrupted by Eleanor's sudden arrival.

Already furious, the sight of her half-naked son and ex-daughter-in-law nearly made her collapse.

"So it's true! You're getting back together!"

She positioned herself protectively before Nathaniel, jabbing a finger at Vivian. "You cursed woman! Have you no shame? My son divorced you! Why must you seduce him?"

Vivian massaged her throbbing temples.

Her former mother-in-law's shrill voice threatened to rupture eardrums.

"Mrs. Whitmore, let's clarify who's seducing whom here. At least I'm decently covered. Look at your son - that towel's hanging dangerously low."

"What did you say?"

"I said your son's indecent exposure qualifies as public indecency. He's the one soliciting at midnight!"

Vivian turned to Nathaniel with mock severity. "I'm talking to you. Adjust that towel before it drops. Who exactly are you trying to impress?"

Eleanor sputtered incoherently.

The final insult came when Nathaniel actually obeyed, hiking up the towel with a smirk. "You, obviously. Got a problem with that?"
###Chapter 292

Eleanor Whitmore could never have predicted her son Nathaniel, known for his icy demeanor, would openly flirt with Vivian Lockhart—the woman she considered a walking disaster. Witnessing this was more shocking than spotting extraterrestrials in Newport City.

"Nat, have you lost your mind? You used to ignore her existence. Why are you suddenly acting like this?" Eleanor's voice trembled with disbelief. "Tell me you're not actually trying to seduce her."

Nathaniel merely shrugged, his expression unreadable.

That silence confirmed Eleanor's worst fears.

Had Vivian been the one pursuing him, she might have understood. But seeing her son chase after his ex-wife? It stripped her of any moral superiority.

"Are you brain-damaged, or has she bewitched you? Do you realize what you're doing? Why are you chasing this walking catastrophe?"

Eleanor's temper flared. She began smacking Nathaniel's arm in frustration.

"Open your eyes!" she shrieked between hits. "For heaven's sake, open your damn eyes! Why are you chasing the woman you divorced? A stallion doesn't return to graze on dead grass! You're humiliating our family!"

Vivian watched Eleanor's outburst with mild alarm, discreetly stepping back to avoid collateral damage.

"Mrs. Whitmore," she interjected coolly, "let's clarify. Technically, I'm not the woman your son divorced—I'm the one who dumped him. And he hasn't 'grazed' anything, because I haven't allowed it."

That drunken night didn't count. In Vivian's mind, it had been mutual indulgence, not submission.

Eleanor's face burned with humiliation. Her strikes grew fiercer. "Did you hear that? She's never cared about you! Stop embarrassing yourself! Put some clothes on!"

Nathaniel remained impassive. "There aren't any."

"You—!"

Eleanor massaged her temples, convinced this situation would give her a stroke.

Meanwhile, Vivian snatched an abandoned tracksuit and slipped into it. Nathaniel rummaged through the wardrobe, retrieving old casual wear.

Finally, the scene looked less scandalous.

Then Eleanor recognized the tracksuit.

Rage reignited.

Those were Cassandra Delacroix's clothes.

"You vile creature!" Eleanor hissed, fists clenched. "Admit it—did you murder Cassandra and my unborn grandchild?"

Vivian didn't flinch. She met Nathaniel's gaze instead. "Cassandra Delacroix committed suicide. Your son knows exactly what happened."

The mention of Cassandra's death still stung.

Cassandra had been the villain, yet Nathaniel had protected her unconditionally—even faking her death. The betrayal still burned.

"Nat, explain this," Eleanor demanded.

Nathaniel stayed silent. His lack of denial confirmed everything.

"See?" Vivian's laugh was razor-sharp. "Your son answered you. Don't waste sympathy on Cassandra. A woman like her would never kill herself."

Though she'd suspected Nathaniel hid Cassandra, hearing his silent confirmation still carved a fresh wound. Disappointment settled heavily in her chest.
###Chapter 293

His unwavering defense of Cassandra Delacroix was a brutal slap to her face. Isabella Lockhart felt nothing but disgust for ever loving such a man.

"I'll leave you two to it. I have urgent matters to attend to."

She couldn't stand another second in that room. Nathan Prescott needed her now more than ever.

Turning at the doorway, she shot Nathaniel Blackwood a lethal glare. "Hide her well, Mr. Blackwood. If I find her, that death certificate might just become reality. The law can't punish me for making a ghost disappear."

The threat was empty - Isabella only wanted Cassandra kept on a tight leash. As long as the woman stayed out of trouble, she'd let sleeping dogs lie.

But her warning would backfire spectacularly...

The moment Isabella left, Eleanor Whitmore snapped out of her daze.

"Cassandra's alive?"

Nathaniel gave a terse nod, his expression stormy. That vicious threat kept replaying in his mind.

Why did Isabella harbor such hatred for Cassandra?

"Praise the heavens! My grandchild survives - the Blackwood lineage continues!" Eleanor clasped her hands in prayer, beaming with relief.

Nathaniel scowled. "I'm still very much alive!"

"And what good is that?" Eleanor scoffed. "You might as well take vows of celibacy. That Cassandra got pregnant was a miracle. If she loses this baby, our family line ends with you!"

She knew her son too well.

Ice ran through his veins. No woman had ever stirred his passions - not even during his marriage to Isabella.

Cassandra's pregnancy was a freak accident. It would never happen again.

Eleanor wasn't blind. She saw Nathaniel's indifference toward Cassandra.

But his reaction to Isabella tonight... That was a man consumed by raw, primal desire.

An audacious plan took shape.

Grabbing Nathaniel's arm, Eleanor declared, "Cassandra's too manipulative for you. Now that she's legally dead, I won't push this farce further. Pay her off after the birth and send her away."

Nathaniel's face darkened.

He'd considered the same, but his brother's dying wish held him back.

Eleanor pressed on, "I'm done with Cassandra, but the Blackwoods need a matriarch. That child deserves a mother. And there's only one suitable candidate - Isabella Lockhart!"

"Have you lost your mind?" Nathaniel gaped at her. "You spent four years convincing me to divorce her!"
###Chapter 294

"She's not perfect, but she's the best option available!"

Margaret Whitmore sighed deeply. "You're nearly thirty, yet you've barely dated anyone."

"Cassandra Delacroix is too manipulative, and Olivia Sinclair's history with your best friend is messy. After careful consideration, Vivian Lockhart is the only suitable choice. Her only flaw is her family background."

"But what truly impresses me is her competence. She quietly built her own company, leads the Tech Innovators Alliance, runs a successful law firm, and even snatched Blackwood Group's biggest clients. She's far from the shallow socialite I assumed. I admire capable women—this new version of her is wife material!"

Nathaniel Blackwood rarely heard his critical mother praise anyone, let alone Vivian. The admission stunned him.

After all, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts were timeless. If Margaret approved, maybe he and Vivian could truly start fresh?

Start fresh?

The thought jolted him.

"Mom, you're overcomplicating things. The question isn't whether she's qualified to be my wife—it's whether she'd even consider it," he said flatly.

"She wouldn't?"

Margaret's frown returned, her usual haughtiness resurfacing. "It's an act. She's playing hard to get. Do you know how many women would sacrifice anything to marry into the Blackwood family? Why else would she have stayed for four years despite everything?"

Nathaniel crushed her optimism. "If being Mrs. Blackwood meant so much, why did she sign the divorce papers without hesitation? Why rush the process?"

Margaret paused.

Her son had a point.

Recalling their earlier interaction, he was the one pursuing Vivian, who seemed utterly indifferent. If this was a game, she was overplaying it.

"Tsk. Sigh."

Margaret scrutinized Nathaniel head to toe, her expression pitying.

He stiffened. "Just say what you're thinking."

She ignored him, first admiring his chiseled features, then poking his toned arms and abs. "This makes no sense. You're even more attractive now. Why has she lost interest?"

Nathaniel: "..."

"Here's an idea," Margaret said gravely. "Change your wardrobe. Stop wearing suits every day—you look too rigid. Women over twenty-five prefer warmth, not ice princes. Try something youthful to reignite her attraction."

Nathaniel barely resisted saying, Thanks, but no thanks, Mom.

Who would've thought the woman who once demanded daily divorces would now coach him on winning Vivian back?

"And adjust your personality. Be proactive. Chat her up. Show enthusiasm." Margaret's urgency grew. "That disaster magnet has charm—half the elite bachelors are already circling her, especially Theodore Osborne's son. If you delay, it'll be too late."

Only now did Margaret realize Vivian's appeal.

Freshly divorced, yet suitors lined up—high-quality ones.

Losing such a daughter-in-law was unacceptable. She'd been blind before. But if Nathaniel acted now, there might still be hope.
###Chapter 295

Nathaniel Blackwood's expression darkened. "Weren't you the one who said a thoroughbred never looks back at eaten grass? What's with this sudden change of heart? Where's your pride?"

Eleanor Whitmore lifted her chin defiantly. "Pride be damned. I won't let a perfect match slip away."

She crossed her arms. "My objection before was because you didn't love her. I refused to watch my son suffer in a loveless marriage. But now..."

"How so?"

"Because you're finally showing interest!"

Eleanor's eyes sparkled with conviction. "In all these years, how many women have truly caught your attention? Now that you've found one, you'd be a fool to let her go."

"I'm not interested."

Nathaniel's denial came sharp and cold.

"Don't lie to me when you can't even lie to yourself."

Eleanor sighed dramatically. "I still don't particularly like her, but if she's your choice, I'll tolerate her. No more calling her bad luck. If necessary, I'll even play nice. I-"

"Stop."

Nathaniel cut her off bluntly. "It's over between us. End of discussion."

At Newport General Hospital.

Oliver Prescott's fractured leg had been set in a cast, requiring two weeks of bed rest.

When Isabella Lockhart arrived at his private room, she found Dominic Harrington already there.

"Mr. Harrington."

She acknowledged him with a polite nod.

Dominic's eyes widened in surprise. "Miss Lockhart! I was just thinking about apologizing to you."

"Apologize?"

Isabella tilted her head in confusion.

"Victoria's recovered now. As her former fiancé, I owe you an apology." Dominic spoke earnestly. "She wasn't in her right mind that day, using you like that. Please forgive her."

He bowed deeply.

His sincerity made Isabella uncomfortable. She quickly pulled him upright. "There's no need for that."

"Please don't hold it against Victoria. She's normally rational. Something must have triggered her."

"I'm not angry." Isabella's voice turned serious. "What I can't understand is why she'd frame me for attempted murder. That's not just irrational - it's malicious."

"I don't know why either..."

Dominic rubbed his neck awkwardly.

"You don't know?" Isabella's curiosity piqued. "Then how can you be sure her accusation is false? Did she confess to you?"
###Chapter 296

"Olivia didn't admit anything—"

Dominic Harrington continued, "I simply believe, knowing your character, you wouldn't stoop to such actions. First, you lack motive. Second, it's beneath you."

Vivian Lockhart scoffed. "Exactly. No motive and beneath me. Even you can see that, yet Nathaniel Blackwood remains blind."

"Nathaniel's naive. He doesn't grasp the complexities of human nature."

"Like a complete fool."

Their shared laughter spoke volumes without words.

Nathan Prescott lay immobilized on the hospital bed, one leg suspended in sterile traction. Agitation radiated from him like heat waves.

When Dominic and Vivian entered, his eyes lit up like a castaway spotting land. "Finally! Get me out of this prison. I can't take another minute."

Dominic frowned. "You fractured your femur. Calm down."

"Impossible!"

Nathan slammed his fist against the mattress. "Strangers feed me, bathe me, even help me piss. And when I tried gaming? The nurse confiscated my controller. This isn't living!"

"I'm leaving. No negotiations."

"But—"

Dominic hesitated. He knew Nathan's stubbornness firsthand. Once decided, no force could sway him.

"Don't you dare move!"

Vivian's command sliced through the tension.

The rebellious patient froze mid-gesture, blinking at her like a chastened child.

She filled a water glass with deliberate movements. "You're a grown man. If independence matters, I'll assist you."

The glass touched his lips as she ordered, "Drink. You're dehydrated."

Nathan's expression twisted with conflict. The room held its breath.

Dominic wiped his brow. These two were combustible together. Any spark could ignite warfare.

Then—miraculously—Nathan bent forward and sipped. "Thanks. I... needed that."

Vivian gazed down like royalty. "More theatrics?"

"No."

"Still leaving?"

"No."

"Good."

She nodded to the hovering nurse. "Proceed with his anti-inflammatory injection."

The same man who'd raged against treatment moments ago now submitted silently. Dominic gaped.

"How?" he whispered. "He obeys only his father. What sorcery is this?"

Vivian flicked her hair. "Charisma, darling."

Post-injection, she turned to Nathan. "Rest now. No arguments."
###Chapter 297

"But I want to—"

Nathan hesitated, his puppy-dog eyes fixed on Vivian. The look was downright pathetic.

"You want to play video games, right? Absolutely not!"

Vivian crossed her arms, channeling her inner school principal.

"Fine! Whatever!"

Defeated, Nathan yanked the blanket over his head with dramatic flair.

The contrast between his tough exterior and childish pouting was oddly endearing.

At the mention of their departure, he immediately peeked out. "Vivian, you promised to take care of me. Was that for real?"

"Obviously."

No hesitation. "You saved my life. Taking care of you is the least I could do."

"Just one warning—I'm not exactly the patient type. If you pull another stunt like today's tantrum, I can't promise I won't throttle you."

"No worries there." Nathan smirked. "With you as my nurse, I'll be the model patient."

He disappeared under the covers again.

Dominic observed the exchange with growing suspicion.

"Mr. Harrington, I'm heading to the supermarket for supplies. Care to join?"

Vivian meant every word about caring for Nathan. This was her debt to repay.

"Give me a minute. Need to have a word with Nathan first."

"Sure."

She didn't pry, simply exiting the room.

Dominic yanked the blanket down, revealing a drowsy Nathan. "What's your game here?"

Nathan blinked sleepily. "Dom? You're still here?"

Dominic's expression darkened. "Cut the act. What's really going on between you and Miss Lockhart?"

"Nothing happened."

Nathan shrugged. "Went for tea, her place caught fire. Saved her, messed up my leg—"

"That's it?"

"That's it!"

"Then why do I get the feeling you're into her?"

"Not a chance!" Nathan scoffed. "She's not my type. You know my preferences. Even if she were the last woman on earth—"

"This is about gratitude. Without her, Julian Montgomery wouldn't have taken my case. I'm just returning the favor."

When Nathan tried elaborating, Dominic cut him off. "Save it. Just remember—some lines shouldn't be crossed. Never poach a brother's girl. You know the rules."

The air turned thick with tension.

Nathan, usually respectful toward Dominic, flashed a sardonic grin. "Relax, I'm not an idiot. But speaking of rule-breakers... weren't you the one who—"

Dominic's face clouded with remorse. "Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. I won't let history repeat itself over another woman."

"Chill." Nathan waved dismissively. "Just killing time. Don't overthink it."

The door swung open abruptly—Ethan strode in mid-conversation.
###Chapter 298

Nathaniel and Dominic froze mid-conversation, guilt flashing across their faces.

"Bro, ever heard of knocking?" Oliver snapped, wincing as he adjusted his injured leg. "Rude much?"

Nathaniel's expression remained icy, his sharp features unreadable. He strode forward, rapping his knuckles against Oliver's cast with deliberate force. "Still hurts?"

Oliver yelped, face contorting in pain. "What the hell, Nate? I nearly died saving your ex-wife, and this is my reward?"

"You seem lively enough," Nathaniel remarked coolly. "If you're fine, stop milking the 'hero' act."

The unspoken tension thickened. Nathaniel despised the idea of Oliver holding that kind of leverage over Vivian. In another era, debts like these were repaid with lifelong servitude—or worse.

"Damn right," Dominic chimed in, smirking. "This idiot even demanded she wait on him hand and foot. Shameless."

"Wait on him?" Nathaniel's gaze darkened, dissecting the implications.

The door swung open. Vivian entered, balancing a steaming bowl of congee. "Oliver, sit up. I made yam and rib congee—it’ll help you heal."

She halted mid-step, spotting Nathaniel and Dominic. Her cheeks flushed. "You two… What are you doing here?"

Nathaniel eyed the bowl, lips curling. "We belong here. You, on the other hand, delivering midnight snacks? How… domestic."

Vivian rolled her eyes, sidestepping him. She perched on the edge of Oliver's bed, stirring the congee before blowing on a spoonful. "Open up. The nurse said liquids are fine now."

Oliver hesitated, hunger warring with self-preservation as Nathaniel’s glare pinned him in place.

"Problem?" Vivian frowned. "I promised to take care of you, and you agreed. Now eat."

Oliver's mouth opened slightly—a trapped man. Offending Vivian meant her wrath. Offending Nathaniel? A death wish.

But the congee smelled divine. His stomach growled. Decision made, he leaned forward—

"His leg’s broken, not his hands," Nathaniel cut in, voice razor-sharp.

Vivian bristled. "He risked his life for me. The least I can do is feed him. Where’s your humanity?"

A beat of silence. Then Nathaniel snatched the bowl from her. "Fine. I’ll do it."

He shoved a spoon at Oliver’s mouth. "Eat."

Oliver choked. "Uh… hard pass."

"So she can feed you, but I can’t?" Nathaniel’s tone dropped to lethal calm. "As your brother, I insist. From now on, I’ll handle your… needs."

Oliver recoiled. "Absolutely not!"
###Chapter 299

Nathaniel's throat worked as he swallowed hard. "The hospital staff can take care of me. You both have busy schedules. Really, there's no need—"

"I insist." Ethan's voice left no room for argument. "You saved her. This is the least I can do. No objections."

Oliver had no choice but to comply.

Before he'd finished the first spoonful of congee, Ethan was already shoving another toward his mouth. By the end, Oliver felt ready to burst.

God, what had he done to deserve this? Saved a life, broken his leg, and now caught in the middle of their marital spat. This had to be the universe's idea of a cruel joke.

Vivian produced a freshly peeled apple the moment the congee disappeared. "Fruit aids digestion," she said brightly.

"Eat it," Ethan commanded.

Oliver's internal scream was almost audible: I'd rather face another car crash than endure this torture.

The apple vanished under Ethan's watchful eye. Vivian immediately produced a slice of cake. Predictably, Ethan ensured every crumb disappeared.

"You've got something on your face—" Vivian began.

Ethan was already scrubbing Oliver's face with a towel before she could finish her sentence.

It became painfully clear—Ethan would intercept every single gesture Vivian attempted to make toward Oliver.

Dominic observed the spectacle with amusement. "Never seen Nate play nurse before. Consider yourself honored, Prescott."

Oliver's strained smile begged: Shoot me now.

When Vivian finally stepped out, Ethan followed like a shadow.

"If you're angry with me, take it out on me. Stop torturing Oliver." Vivian whirled to face him in the empty hallway.

Ethan's smirk was infuriating. "Torture? I was being exceptionally attentive to my injured friend."

"Attentive?" Vivian's laugh held no humor. "You force-fed him like a goose being fattened for foie gras. That wasn't care—that was waterboarding with congee."

"He didn't complain."

"Because you'd probably break his other leg if he did!"

Ethan's gaze turned speculative. "Why so defensive over Oliver? Planning to repay him... personally?"

Vivian's mouth fell open. "You're unbelievable. Fine. If you're so worried I'll corrupt your precious friend, consider me officially out of the picture. He's all yours."

She stormed toward the elevators without looking back.

Ethan stared after her, frustration warring with confusion. How had she twisted this into him protecting Oliver?

Couldn't she see the only person he was protecting Oliver from... was herself?
###Chapter 300

Vivian stormed out of the hospital, her anger boiling over.

"That arrogant bastard! Who does he think he is? So terrified I'll tarnish his precious friend's perfect life."

The sheer condescension made her blood boil.

She hailed a cab back to Blackwood Villa.

Evelyn was already waiting, wringing her hands nervously.

When Vivian appeared, Evelyn rushed forward. "Miss Viv, what happened? How could Lockhart Manor burn down while I was grocery shopping? Why did you tell me to meet you here?"

Seeing Evelyn's familiar face shattered Vivian's composure.

She collapsed into Evelyn's arms like a child, sobbing uncontrollably. "You took forever! Our home... it's gone! Everything's gone!"

"Hush now, Miss Viv. Don't cry!" Evelyn stroked Vivian's back soothingly. "Our home isn't gone. Home is wherever we are together. Buildings can be rebuilt. Dry those tears!"

"But the memories..." Vivian's voice broke. "We can rebuild the house, but Grandpa's fingerprints on the banister... Mom's favorite rose bushes... Dad's study... all gone to ashes."

"Memories live in here." Evelyn tapped Vivian's chest. "No fire can burn what's in our hearts. You're stronger than this, Miss Viv. The Lockhart heiress I know doesn't surrender to flames."

"You're right... I won't be defeated." Vivian wiped her tears.

Grandpa Arthur's words echoed in her mind - tears were for the weak. The strong transformed pain into power.

Self-pity was worthless. Rebuilding the Lockhart legacy mattered more.

"Evelyn, we'll rise stronger. We'll stay here while reconstructing Lockhart Manor. When we're done, all of Newport City will witness the Lockhart phoenix rising from ashes!"

Vivian's fierce declaration ignited Evelyn's spirit.

They began transforming Blackwood Villa, infusing every corner with Lockhart essence.

Morning came.

Vivian rose early and headed to the kitchen she knew intimately from four years of marriage.

Her cooking skills had gathered dust since the divorce.

Recently craving sour flavors, she decided to make lemon chicken feet.

As she finished marinating, Evelyn's tense voice interrupted.

"Miss Viv, we have... company."

"Company?"

Vivian wiped her hands and stepped out.

Eleanor Whitmore sat primly in the living room.

Not company. A harbinger of trouble.

Their last encounter had ended badly. This unexpected visit boded ill.

"To what do we owe this early pleasure, Mrs. Whitmore?"
###Chapter 301

Vivian arched an eyebrow. Her stance was anything but welcoming. She looked ready for battle.

This wasn't the timid Vivian from before. She no longer needed to tiptoe around Eleanor's feelings. If Eleanor wanted trouble today, she'd get it.

But what happened next made Vivian's eyes widen in shock.

Eleanor actually smiled at her warmly.

"Can't a mother check on her daughter-in-law? I don't need an excuse to visit family."

"What?"

Vivian's mouth fell open.

Had Eleanor lost her mind? This was the woman who'd called her a curse for years. The sudden kindness was terrifying.

Evelyn chirped excitedly, "Miss Viv! Mrs. Whitmore brought you a gift! Should we open it?"

"Wait, I—"

Before Vivian could protest, Evelyn had already torn into the velvet box.

"Oh my! A sapphire necklace! This must have cost a fortune!"

Evelyn played the enthusiastic hostess, gushing over Eleanor's generosity. She claimed the necklace was perfect for Vivian, said they looked like real mother and daughter.

Vivian shot her a glare. 'What game are you playing? You know we hate each other!'

Eleanor waved a dismissive hand. "Just a little something. Barely six figures. It reminded me of you."

Every word still dripped with aristocratic pride, but the change in her demeanor was staggering.

Instead of feeling touched, Vivian took a defensive step back. "Mrs. Whitmore, please stop this act. Call me your family's curse like usual. If you want something, just say it."

"You—!"

Eleanor's mask almost slipped, but she caught herself. "Don't be ridiculous. You're Nathaniel's wife. Of course I'd buy gifts for my daughter-in-law."

"I don't want it!"

Vivian shoved the box away and grabbed her phone. "One more weird move and I'm calling Nathaniel."

"Wait!"

Eleanor's pleasant facade cracked. "Fine. I came to discuss your marriage."

"We're divorced. Nothing left to discuss."

Vivian's scoff nearly broke Eleanor's composure again.

"I see how you two still look at each other. My son doesn't love easily. After careful consideration... I won't force him to remarry. I want you to reconcile."

Eleanor continued, "You know Cassandra's alive. Once she delivers the baby, I'll make sure she disappears. But my grandchild needs a proper mother. You'd be perfect."

Vivian burst out laughing. "You want me to play stepmom at twenty-six?"

"The child won't know the difference. You'll be its real mother in every way that matters."

Eleanor leaned in. "Agree, and the Blackwood family will treat you like royalty. Nathaniel will be eternally grateful. You might even have children of your own someday. Well?"
###Chapter 302

Vivian Lockhart watched as Margaret Whitmore lowered herself to make such a ridiculous proposal. The woman actually expected gratitude.

As if.

Not long ago, Vivian would have done anything to stay in the Blackwood family. Now? She couldn't stop laughing.

Tears streamed down her face. Who knew the proud Eleanor Whitmore had such comedic talent?

Eleanor's patience snapped. "What's so funny? Give me an answer! This is a one-time offer. Don't be ungrateful!"

Vivian wiped her eyes, her amusement fading into icy disdain. "Mrs. Whitmore, let me be clear. I have zero interest in returning to your son. Even if Nathaniel Blackwood begs on his knees, the answer remains no. And I sure as hell won't play stepmother to his mistress's child."

"You... you can't mean that."

Eleanor hadn't anticipated refusal.

Nathaniel had been right. Vivian had moved on. No lingering feelings meant no reconciliation.

Her least favorite daughter-in-law was slipping away. What would become of her son then?

Panic set in. Eleanor wished she could chain Vivian to the Blackwood estate.

"Don't be hasty. Sleep on it. You loved Nathaniel deeply—that doesn't vanish overnight. You're just angry, aren't you?"

Eleanor forced calm. "Let's talk woman to woman. Has your type changed? No longer into the cold, brooding CEO?"

"Perhaps you prefer warmth? Creativity? A wild streak? Nathaniel can adapt. I'll make him change!"

Vivian's voice turned arctic. "Save your breath. When I loved him, I loved him despite his flaws. Now? Not even his death would rekindle my heart."

"The moment he chose Cassandra Delacroix over me? That killed any love I had. Cruelty I could forgive. Infidelity? Never."

Eleanor scoffed. "Men err. Your marriage lacked love initially—his affair was understandable. What matters is he chooses you now."

"High-society marriages rarely involve love. Even when they do, it never lasts. Why cling to such ideals?"

Vivian smirked. "If elite marriages are so miserable, why would I want one? Unless Cassandra vanishes, reconciliation is impossible."

This wasn't about hatred. It was a reminder—Nathaniel's betrayal must never be forgotten.

"So it's her or you?"

Eleanor finally grasped the condition. She inhaled sharply. "Very well. Nathaniel and I will... handle Cassandra."

Vivian almost explained, then stopped. Let them misinterpret. "Believe what you want. She's why my love died."

Evelyn Whitmore grew anxious watching the tension. She genuinely hoped for reconciliation. The late Arthur Lockhart had orchestrated this marriage for a reason.

"Don't rush, Mrs. Whitmore. Any betrayed woman would react this way. If she didn't, it'd mean she never loved him."

Evelyn whispered, "Let me persuade Miss Lockhart. But Mr. Blackwood mustn't disappoint her again."

Eleanor nodded approvingly. "Good instincts for a servant. You'll be rewarded."

She pulled Evelyn closer, whispering strategies to change Vivian's mind.

Their intense scheming left Vivian speechless.
###Chapter 303

Vivian Lockhart never thought the day would come when her former mother-in-law and her nanny would join forces, plotting to reunite her with that despicable ex-husband of hers.

The absurdity of it all made her stomach churn.

She stormed into the kitchen and pulled out the marinated lemon chicken feet she’d been craving all morning.

The moment the dish hit the table, the tangy aroma filled the air. Even Eleanor Whitmore, with her refined sensibilities, couldn’t ignore it.

“That smells incredible. Did you make this yourself?”

Eleanor’s curiosity got the better of her. She drifted toward the dining table, her nose twitching at the scent.

“Want one?”

Vivian had already slipped on her gloves, ready to dig in. Pregnancy cravings had been relentless lately, and sour foods were her current obsession.

Eleanor hesitated, but her hand moved on its own, plucking a chicken foot from the plate.

One bite was all it took. Her eyes widened in shock.

“You—you actually made this? It’s divine!”

All pretense of high-society decorum vanished. She reached for another before she’d even finished the first.

She’d dined at the finest restaurants, tasted delicacies from around the world, but Vivian’s lemon chicken feet? They were in a league of their own.

“If I’d known you could cook like this, I never would have let Nathaniel divorce you. Why didn’t you tell me you had this talent?”

Eleanor was already mentally calculating how many more she could eat before it became impolite.

Vivian hadn’t expected her notoriously difficult ex-mother-in-law to be won over by something as simple as chicken feet.

Too bad it was far too late for that now.

“Do you have any more? I’d love to take some home for Nathaniel.”

Eleanor’s tone was uncharacteristically earnest.

“There’s a little left. I’ll pack it for you.”

Vivian didn’t mind sharing. It felt oddly satisfying to have Eleanor finally appreciate something she’d made—especially after all those years of trying (and failing) to impress her.

Eleanor left with her precious takeout box, practically glowing with satisfaction.

But her good mood evaporated the second she spotted the man stepping off the bus outside.

Tall, striking, and radiating an aura that screamed trouble.

Her instincts flared.

“Who are you looking for?”

She blocked his path, her tone dripping with disdain.

Julian Blackthorn studied her for a moment before flashing a lazy smile.

“Vivian Lockhart. I heard she’s staying here.”

“You’re here for Vivian?”

Eleanor’s spine stiffened. Her voice turned razor-sharp.

“What’s your relationship with my daughter-in-law?”
###Chapter 304

"Your daughter-in-law?"

A dangerous smirk played on Julian Blackthorn's striking features.

So this elegantly dressed woman was Eleanor Whitmore, Vivian's former mother-in-law.

"To my knowledge, Miss Lockhart is currently unattached. It's rather presumptuous of you to claim such a title."

"What would you know?"

Eleanor lifted her chin defiantly. "One day as my daughter-in-law means forever my daughter-in-law. Until she remarries, no one can strip me of that position."

Julian slid his hands into his tailored pockets with an amused chuckle. "Then I'm afraid you'll be sorely disappointed. I'm actually here to escort Miss Lockhart to meet my family. Should things proceed smoothly, she'll soon have a new mother-in-law."

Eleanor's sense of impending crisis spiked. "Who exactly are you? Who are your parents? What's your relationship with Vivian?"

Before he could respond, she barreled on confidently, "Do you have any idea how deeply Vivian loves my son? How desperately she longs to become Mrs. Blackwood again? Their reconciliation is inevitable. She'd never entertain meeting your parents."

"Is that so?"

Julian's smirk widened as he arched an eyebrow. "Shall we ask her together how much she 'loves' your son and 'yearns' to reclaim that title?"

Ahem.

Eleanor's composure faltered slightly. "That won't be necessary. Time will tell."

If confronted directly, her fabricated claims would crumble instantly. She'd never subject herself to such humiliation!

"Mark my words—her ex-husband is Nathaniel Blackwood. A woman of her caliber would never settle for some nobody!"

Unfazed, Julian replied cheerfully, "As you said—we'll let time decide."

Eleanor stormed into Blackwood Group's headquarters like a hurricane. Employees ducked behind monitors, recognizing the storm warning in her stiletto clicks.

"Where's my son? I demand to see him immediately!"

She marched straight to the executive floor and slammed both palms on the secretary's desk.

"Madam Whitmore, the CEO is in a board meeting. Perhaps you'd like to wait in—"

"No delays! This is critical!"

She barged into the conference room without knocking. "Nathaniel! Drop this nonsense meeting—you're about to lose your wife!"

Gasps.

Dozens of executives' professional façades cracked as gossip-hungry ears perked up. Blackwood Group housed the most devoted "Vivian-Nathaniel" shippers in the corporate world.

Nathaniel massaged his temples, wishing the marble floor would swallow him whole.

Through gritted teeth, he stood. "My office. Now."

Eleanor nodded approvingly. "Finally, some urgency!"

The moment the door closed behind them, the boardroom erupted.

"Told you our CEO still loves her! The reconciliation arc begins!"

"$100K says Vivian takes him back!"

"$500K against it—that woman never looks backward!"

"$100K on romantic redemption!"
###Chapter 305

"200,000 dors says it's over!"

The fate of Ethan and Vivian's relationship became the hottest betting pool in Blackwood Group. From executives to janitors, everyone placed their wagers. Payday couldn't come soon enough!

CEO's Office.

"What happened?"

Ethan's composed facade shattered the moment the door closed. He turned to Margaret, urgency lacing his voice. "Who's Vivian running off with?"

Margaret studied her son's reaction. The ice-cold CEO was finally in love—for real this time. She wasn't sure whether to celebrate or despair.

"No clue who he is. Tall, handsome, rugged. Nothing like you. If Vivian's type has changed, you're in trouble..."

She delivered the brutal truth.

Ethan's jaw tightened, but he forced a careless shrug. "So what? We're divorced. She can date whoever she wants. Not my business."

"Stop lying to me, you stubborn brat!"

Margaret resisted the urge to kick him. Her son had inherited her pride instead of her emotional intelligence.

"If you truly don't care, then let her go. Just don't come crying to me later."

She crossed her arms. "That handsome stranger mentioned meeting his parents. He seemed serious. If you've got any guts left, go stop her now."

Ethan's chest constricted. "Was it Liam Osborne?"

"No!"

Margaret scoffed. "If it were Liam, I wouldn't be here. Those two were just playing games. This one's different—he carries himself like royalty. Probably your equal in status."

That unsettling thought had sent her rushing to Ethan's office.

His expression darkened.

Impressive, Isabella Lockhart. Three months post-divorce, and suitors are lining up at your door. Must be getting crowded.

Margaret pressed on. "But don't back down. You shared four years together. No one else has that history."

She leaned in. "I tested the waters today. She's not over you. Briar's the real problem. Vivian won't tolerate her. She made that crystal clear—it's either her or Briar. You need to choose."

Ethan's eyes turned glacial. "She actually said that?"

"Word for word. She despises Briar."

Margaret sighed. "Can't blame her. If I loved someone, I wouldn't share either. So? Which one will you discard?"

"I won't abandon Briar."

His resolve was unshakable.

Margaret frowned. "Explain this nonsense. You don't even like Briar. Why protect her at Vivian's expense?"

"Life isn't just about love. There's duty. Honor." His fists clenched. "If she can't accept Briar, then we were never meant to be."

Margaret threw up her hands. "Then what's your move? Will you really let Vivian meet his parents? Are you seriously okay with that?"
###Chapter 306

Ethan's face remained impassive. "She's free to do as she pleases. We're divorced now. It's not like I can chain her to the house."

Margaret glared at her son, frustration simmering beneath her carefully maintained composure. The woman had raised one of Newport City's most powerful CEOs, yet he couldn't even keep hold of his own wife.

"Keep pretending you don't care," she snapped. "See if that brings her back."

Truthfully, Margaret hadn't been Vivian's biggest fan initially. She'd only warmed to the girl because Ethan had been so obviously smitten.

Then there were those divine lemon chicken feet. One bite had been enough to change Margaret's entire perspective. Now the thought of losing her future daughter-in-law—and those heavenly snacks—was unbearable.

Anger transformed into appetite. Margaret popped open the takeout container, the tangy aroma of citrus and spice immediately filling Ethan's sterile office.

Ethan watched, bewildered, as his usually poised mother devoured chicken feet with uncharacteristic gusto. "Mother, what are you doing?"

"Eating," came the muffled reply around a mouthful of gelatinous delight.

The flavors exploded on her tongue—perfectly balanced between spicy, sour, and sweet. Vivian's culinary skills alone made reconciliation worth pursuing.

Ethan's nose wrinkled. "You know I don't eat street food."

"Try one," Margaret insisted, thrusting a glistening piece toward him. "You might surprise yourself."

Midday hunger won over prejudice. Ethan took a cautious bite. Then another. And another.

"Well?" Margaret arched an eyebrow.

"It's... exceptional," he admitted grudgingly.

Margaret seized her opportunity. "Vivian made these. Specifically for you. Did she ever cook for you during your marriage?"

Ethan froze. The realization hit like a physical blow. He vaguely recalled similar dishes at family dinners—meals he'd ignored in favor of more "sophisticated" fare.

"I see this is new for you too." Margaret sighed. "I misjudged Vivian. There are depths to her we never bothered to explore."

Ethan's expression darkened. "What's the point? She's made her choice."

"You're Nathaniel Blackwood," Margaret snapped. "Since when do you accept defeat?"

The empty container between them seemed to mock his hesitation. That single taste had revealed more about his ex-wife than four years of marriage. Now the real question remained—was it too late to change the ending?
###Chapter 307

Margaret Whitmore gave Nathaniel Blackwood an encouraging pat on the shoulder. "If you're willing to fight for it, what you've lost will return to you stronger than before."

Without another word, she left Blackwood Group.

Standing alone in his expansive office, Nathaniel stared at the lemon chicken feet in the takeout box. He could almost picture Isabella Lockhart bustling around the kitchen, and the thought warmed his chest.

At Blackwood Villa.

Isabella and Evelyn Whitmore had prepared a feast for Julian Blackthorn, who had dropped by unexpectedly.

"Julian, we owe you so much for saving Evelyn. I've been meaning to invite you over as thanks, but things kept getting in the way." Isabella raised a glass of juice. "Consider this a toast!"

Evelyn stood as well, filling her own glass with wine. "Mr. Blackthorn, thank you for everything. Cheers!"

Julian chuckled, his gaze lingering on Isabella. "You're welcome, Evelyn. But Miss Lockhart... I recall you promised me more than just a meal."

Isabella rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly. "That was just heat-of-the-moment talk. Doesn't count."

"So you do remember our little agreement." His smile widened. "Relax—it's just a favor for a friend. Meeting parents doesn't mean marriage."

Isabella nodded. "True. These days, even marriage doesn’t guarantee forever."

If playing pretend for Julian solved his problem, why not? She hated owing people. Once this was done, she could face him without that weight.

"Wait—meet whose parents?" Evelyn looked between them, alarmed. "Don’t be reckless. That’s serious business!"

She turned to Isabella. "And you’re supposed to be reconciling with Mr. Blackwood. What if he finds out?"

Isabella scoffed. "Who said I’m reconciling? That arrogant man still thinks I’m a murderer. He’d probably throw a party if I ruined someone else’s life instead."

Anger flared. She shot Julian a determined look. "When are we doing this? I’m free anytime. Let’s show him how popular I am."

Julian’s eyebrows lifted. "No time like the present. We’ll go after lunch."

"Deal."

They left shortly after.

"This is madness!" Evelyn called after them, but it was no use.

Just as panic set in, Nathaniel arrived.

Evelyn rushed to him like he was salvation itself. "Mr. Blackwood! Miss Lockhart just ran off with another man! They can’t be far—hurry!"
###Chapter 308

Ethan's chiseled features turned to ice. "That damn woman actually ran away!"

Evelyn Whitmore leaned in with urgent information. "I overheard them saying they're headed to Edinburgh. They're on their way to the airport now. If you leave immediately, you might still intercept them—"

"Edinburgh?"

His fists clenched, knuckles white, eyes burning with fury. "She better hope I don't catch her, or I'll snap her legs myself!"

Without another word, he slammed the accelerator of his sleek sports car, tearing through Newport City toward the largest airport.

The moment he stormed into the terminal, his gaze locked onto Vivian and Julian Blackthorn, who had just arrived.

"You."

Ethan's voice dripped with venom as he took in Julian standing beside Vivian.

"What the hell are you doing here?"

Vivian stiffened, guilt flashing across her face as if she'd been caught in an affair. Instinctively, she stepped back.

Julian, however, remained unshaken. He extended a hand, lips curving into a calm smile. "Mr. Blackwood, it's been a while. Business trip?"

Ethan ignored the gesture, his contempt fixed on Vivian. "So this is the incredible man you were in such a hurry to meet? Just a hacker who slinks around in the shadows like a rat."

Vivian's temper flared. "Insult me all you want, but don't you dare disrespect hackers. They're not rats—they're brilliant minds who choose discretion. Think you're untouchable? Cross them, and they'll expose every skeleton in your closet."

Ethan had no idea Vivian was Scarlet Phoenix. Her passionate defense only fueled his rage, twisting into something darker. "Pathetic. Has he told you about the deal he made behind your back?"

To him, her naivety was staggering.

If she knew this so-called genius had taken his money to lock away evidence that could have cleared her nanny's name—would she still defend him?

Vivian smirked. "Whatever deal Julian made with you, the fact remains—you needed him. He profited from his skills. However you spin it, you lost. So why are you still acting superior?"

Ethan's jaw tightened. Her sharp words were a match to gasoline.

He turned to Julian, voice dangerously low. "Nothing to confess?"

Julian shrugged, hands in his pockets. "Ah, you mean when you paid me to reinforce the hospital's cloud security—to keep Miss Lockhart from proving her nanny's innocence."

Ethan hadn't expected such blunt honesty. "At least you admit it."

Julian's smile widened. "Of course. I told Miss Lockhart everything weeks ago. Even split the ten million with her as an apology. She accepted graciously—even treated me to dinner."

Vivian nodded, amusement dancing in her eyes. "Ten million, Ethan. Had I known you were so generous, I'd have become a hacker myself. Blackwood Group's systems are riddled with vulnerabilities. I could make a fortune just fixing your mistakes."

Ethan's face burned with fury.

So he was the fool? They'd played him—just like that auction where she'd conspired with Liam Osborne to swindle him out of millions for a damn ring.

Vivian Lockhart, you really do love making a fool out of me.
###Chapter 309

Ethan Blackwood clenched his fists, struggling to contain the fury boiling inside him. His piercing gaze locked onto Vivian Lockhart. "You knew exactly what kind of man he is," he bit out. "So why get close to him? Are you out of your damn mind?"

Vivian met his glare head-on, a mocking smirk playing on her lips. "What kind of man? A hacker, sure. People pay him for his skills. What’s unreasonable about that?"

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "You’d go to any lengths to protect your little hacker boyfriend, wouldn’t you? Even destroying evidence behind my back. If anyone’s shady here, it’s you. Maybe I should be the one staying away."

Silence.

Vivian had a point.

In terms of deception, Ethan had done far worse than Julian Blackthorn. What right did he have to judge?

Julian checked his watch, lips curling into a smug smile. "Apologies, Mr. Blackwood, but our flight is boarding. Move aside. This is Vivian’s first meeting with my parents. We wouldn’t want to be late."

A deliberate twist of the knife.

Ethan’s control snapped.

Jealousy and rage surged through him. He seized Vivian’s wrist, yanking her toward him. "She’s not going anywhere with you."

Vivian recoiled, struggling against his grip. "Let go of me!"

Ethan only tightened his hold, pulling her flush against his chest. "No. You’re not leaving with him."

"Who the hell do you think you are?"

Was he insane?

Her life was none of his business anymore.

Vivian snarled, "We’re divorced. I’m single. You have no right!"

Ethan’s voice turned icy. "Divorced, yes. But I made a promise to your grandfather—to keep you safe for life. That hacker has no power, no wealth. He can’t give you what you deserve. I won’t let you throw yourself away."

Vivian blinked.

Her grandfather had never said any such thing.

Ethan’s arrogance was staggering. "I’ll consider stepping back if you find a man who measures up to me. Until then? You’re not going anywhere."

Vivian gaped.

The audacity.

Did he really believe no one could match him?

"Ethan, you’re delusional," she spat. "Hackers aren’t penniless. For all you know, Julian’s worth could eclipse yours. And he’s just as capable."

Ethan scoffed, pride stung. Like a petulant child, he couldn’t resist the challenge. "Then let’s compare. Right here, right now."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "That’s unfair. Your fortune was built by generations. His? He earned it himself."
###Chapter 310

The dramatic display sent shockwaves through the airport crowd.

Nathaniel Blackwood and Isabella Lockhart exchanged bewildered glances, completely thrown by the unexpected spectacle.

Julian Blackthorn's expression darkened as he stared at the elderly man kneeling before him. Displeasure radiated from his tense posture.

"Alfred, didn't I explicitly say I'd return to Edinburgh on my own terms?" His voice carried sharp irritation. "This public spectacle is unnecessary!"

The silver-haired butler remained bowed but spoke with quiet determination. "Master Julian, the entire Baldwin family awaits your return with bated breath."

"They fear you might disappear again. I've been instructed to ensure your safe passage." He gestured toward a private jet on the tarmac. "The aircraft stands ready. Please don't make this difficult."

"Ensure my passage?" Julian scoffed, rolling his eyes dramatically. "You mean babysit me. After all these years, Grandfather still insists on controlling everything. Is it any wonder I left?"

His expression softened as he glanced at Isabella. "But this time, you needn't worry. I'm bringing Grandfather's future granddaughter-in-law home with me. I wouldn't dream of running now."

Alfred's eyes brightened instantly as they landed on Isabella. "Ah! This must be the young mistress Julian speaks of." He bowed deeply. "Your grace and beauty perfectly suit our family's heir. You embody everything Old Master Frederick - no, the entire Baldwin clan - desires in his successor's bride!"

Isabella's cheeks burned. She shot Julian an incredulous look, her eyes flashing with silent accusation. When had he informed his entire dynasty about her? The ambush left her no graceful exit.

"The Baldwins?" Nathaniel's gaze sharpened like honed steel as he reassessed the hacker. This carefree tech genius concealed far more than he'd revealed.

"Indeed, Mr. Blackwood." Julian's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Frederick Baldwin, overlord of Edinburgh, happens to be my grandfather."

He straightened, shedding his casual demeanor like a discarded coat. "To be precise, I'm Julian Baldwin - sole heir to the Baldwin fortune. The hacker persona? Merely a diversion to alleviate boredom."

Recognition flashed in Nathaniel's eyes. The Blackwoods of Harborview and Baldwins of Edinburgh stood as rival titans, each dominating their respective coasts while maintaining an uneasy truce.

He'd long sought to meet his counterpart, but the elusive Baldwin heir famously avoided family obligations. That their first encounter should occur through Isabella struck him as bitterly ironic.

"Surprised?" Julian shoved his hands in his pockets, the picture of relaxed confidence. Where Nathaniel exuded icy authority, Julian radiated boyish charm - a stark contrast to their shared elite status.

"I assumed you'd investigated me thoroughly, given our families'... complicated history." His grin turned wolfish. "I've certainly kept tabs on you, Mr. Blackwood. Been living in your shadow since childhood."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Meaning you targeted her deliberately."

"Not entirely." Julian's gaze flicked to Isabella. "Years ago, General Arthur intended to entrust Isabella to my care. I foolishly declined that honor."

His smile turned triumphant. "Now that she's free again, I'm merely claiming what should have been mine all along. Surely her ex-husband won't deny us his blessing?"
###Chapter 311

Julian Blackwood reached for Vivian Lockhart's wrist with unwavering confidence.

Ethan Blackwood's grip tightened instantly. His eyes narrowed into dangerous slits. "Is that so?" His voice dripped with icy challenge. "Let's see you try."

Vivian stood trapped between them, her arms nearly wrenched from their sockets.

Enough was enough.

"Stop!" She wrenched free with a violent twist, delivering sharp kicks to both men's shins. "What the hell is wrong with you two? Do I look like some damn tug-of-war rope?" Her chest heaved with fury as she crossed her arms. "Has it occurred to either of you to ask what I want?"

The men broke their death glare to stare at her.

Ethan's voice turned arctic. "If you had half a brain, you'd realize he's using you. Figure it out."

Julian merely shrugged. "Guilty as charged." A rakish grin spread across his face. "My motive? I'm madly in love with you. The Blackwoods and Lockharts are equals. I can give you everything he ever did - and more."

Vivian's gaze flickered between them.

Decision made, she strode to Julian's side. "One broke my heart," she said coldly. "The other might actually cherish it. The choice is obvious."

She linked arms with Julian, head held high as they walked toward the gate. For the first time in years, she breathed freely.

To Ethan, she'd been disposable. To Julian, she was priceless.

Ethan watched them go, his chest caving in. The realization hit like a sledgehammer - he'd just lost something irreplaceable.

Onboard the private jet, Vivian's posture remained rigid. Not a single tremor betrayed the storm inside.

Nathan Prescott's words echoed in her mind: Never let them see you bleed.

True to Dominic Harrington's promise, the Blackwoods had chartered the entire plane. Vivian sank into the plush first-class seat, watching Newport City shrink beneath the clouds.

Julian appeared with an armful of desserts. "Sugar helps everything." He offered a chocolate torte. "Even heartbreak."

Vivian snatched it immediately. "Exactly. Can't cry on an empty stomach." She devoured the cake while staring mournfully out the window.

Julian chuckled. Only this woman could simultaneously radiate devastation while inhaling pastries.

He studied her profile - the delicate slope of her nose, the sorrow darkening her amber eyes. His pulse stuttered.

"So..." He cleared his throat. "Did you mean what you said back there?"
###Chapter 312

Vivian turned to Julian, her breath catching as she met his intense gaze. For a moment, she couldn't speak.

Then she arched an eyebrow. "And you? Were you serious about what you said?"

Julian's pulse jumped erratically. 'Why am I reacting like this?' He barely recognized himself.

He forced a smirk. "Dead serious. The moment I discovered you're Scarlet Phoenix, I regretted not marrying you four years ago."

Vivian laughed lightly. "The Blackwoods are quite prestigious. Would they accept a divorcee like me?"

Julian's expression darkened. "What's wrong with being divorced?" His voice turned sharp. "Any man who let you go was a fool. Marrying a divorcee like you would be any man's greatest fortune."

"But your family—"

"Won't object." Julian cut her off. "I guarantee they'll welcome you with open arms."

He leaned closer. "My grandfather worshipped yours. When he learns you're Arthur Lockhart's granddaughter, he'll have our wedding planned before sunset. The Blackwoods might not have valued you, but the Baldwins will treasure you."

Some tension left Vivian's shoulders. "Alright. I'll consider it."

Julian's grin turned boyish. "That's as good as a yes!"

The three-hour flight from Edinburgh to Newport City passed quickly. After chatting, Vivian dozed off, only waking when the plane touched down.

Julian suddenly looked uneasy. "Don't freak out, but my family can be... intense." He hesitated.

Vivian removed her sleep mask, blinking drowsily. "Hmm?"

He rubbed his neck. "Just... don't let it overwhelm you."

Vivian waved him off, following him off the plane without concern.

Then she froze.

"A little intense" was the understatement of the century.

Hundreds of drones filled the sky, forming the words "WELCOME LADY VIVIAN!"

Worse, the entire airport parking lot had been cleared for an army of soldiers who shouted in unison: "Welcome to the Baldwin family, Lady Vivian!"

Vivian shrieked, grabbing Julian's arm for dear life.

The soldiers began marching in formation, spears glinting, looking ready for war.

"What the hell?" Vivian gasped, clinging to Julian like a lifeline.
###Chapter 313

Vivian's pulse raced as panic gripped her. "Are they declaring war? Am I about to die?"

Nathaniel chuckled, ruffling her hair with an apologetic grin. "Just the Blackwoods' dramatic way of welcoming guests. I did try to warn you."

She shot him a glare. "Not hard enough."

Taking a deep breath, Vivian finally exhaled her tension. "I nearly had a heart attack! For a second there, I thought they were assassins!"

"Relax, you're our honored guest." Nathaniel winked playfully before grabbing her hand. "Remember, we're selling this act. Grandpa will spot any fakeness immediately."

Vivian squeezed his fingers and nodded. "Don't worry, I've got this."

Hand in hand, they approached the military formation.

At the center stood an elderly officer dripping with medals, flanked by a distinguished couple as they emerged from an armored vehicle.

"Grandfather! Father! Mother!" Nathaniel's voice cracked with emotion as he waved enthusiastically. After so long away, the sight of family overwhelmed him. He released Vivian's hand, arms outstretched for an embrace.

Instead, Frederick Blackwood shoved him aside with a sharp smack. "Out of the way, boy!"

The patriarch immediately turned his attention to Vivian, beaming. "You must be Isabella! Arthur Lockhart's granddaughter?"

Caught off guard by the intensity, Vivian nodded stiffly. "Yes, that's me."

Frederick's eyes grew misty. "I've waited twenty years for this moment. Arthur saved my life, but my foolish pride destroyed our friendship. I never got to see him one last time."

"You have his eyes," Frederick observed warmly. "And that same regal bearing - a natural leader."

William Blackwood and Eleanor Kingsley exchanged approving glances. "Miss Lockhart, you're absolutely breathtaking," Eleanor gushed, patting Vivian's hand. "What a treasure the Hunts let slip away!"

"Hardly surprising," William added with amusement. "Your mother was Newport City's most sought-after beauty in her day. You've clearly inherited her charms."

Overwhelmed by their fervor, Vivian could only offer a strained smile, shooting Nathaniel a desperate look.

Taking the hint, Nathaniel immediately pulled her behind him. "Easy everyone - you're terrifying my girlfriend!"

Frederick chuckled. "No need for nerves, dear. You're the future lady of Blackwood Manor." His eyes twinkled. "To show our sincerity, we've prepared a very special gift..."
###Chapter 314

"Gift?" Isabella immediately recoiled, shaking her head. "Mr. Baldwin, that's very kind of you..."

Her voice trailed off as she took another step back. "But I can't accept anything. I didn't bring you a gift either. This is too much."

The warmth in Frederick Baldwin's gesture made her chest tighten. After the Lockhart family's downfall and her marriage into the Blackwood family, all she'd known was cold judgment and resentment.

This unexpected kindness stung with guilt. The entire charade weighed heavier on her conscience now.

Nathaniel's grandfather frowned, his expression turning serious. "Nonsense. I don't give gifts lightly. As the future lady of the Baldwin estate, you deserve nothing less than a proper dowry."

"A dowry?" Isabella's stomach twisted. She shot a desperate look at Julian, who deliberately avoided her gaze.

"Grandfather," Julian interjected smoothly, "the Blackwoods gave her a billion-dollar mansion. Surely we can do better than that?"

"Money?" Frederick scoffed, his lip curling at the mention of Harborview City's elite family. "Only nouveau riche like the Blackwoods would measure worth in currency."

With a proud gesture, he indicated the assembled soldiers. "You're Arthur Lockhart's granddaughter - born to lead. It's a shame your father abandoned his military legacy for business and failed spectacularly."

His piercing gaze locked onto Isabella. "That's why I'm giving you Shadow Legion."

Isabella's breath caught. "An... entire legion?"

She'd expected jewels, property, perhaps even stocks. Never this.

"My personal elite force," Frederick confirmed, removing a medal from his uniform. "Each soldier handpicked for exceptional skill. They answer only to the bearer of this insignia."

As the weighty metal touched her palm, Frederick turned to the troops. "From this moment, your allegiance belongs to General Lockhart!"

Five hundred voices roared in unison: "For General Lockhart!"

The protest died on Isabella's lips. Something primal stirred in her blood as she met their disciplined gazes.

Childhood memories surfaced - her grandfather's war stories, her secret dreams of military glory, of restoring the Lockhart name through battlefield honor rather than boardrooms.

Fingers closing around the medal, Isabella raised it high. Her voice carried across the field with unexpected command: "For honor! For victory!"

The answering cheer shook the ground beneath her feet.
###Chapter 315

Anyone witnessing this spectacle would have been stunned, but Vivian thrived in it. The battlefield seemed to pulse through her veins as she roared her battle cry with unshakable conviction.

"Magnificent—absolutely magnificent!" Frederick's voice trembled with pride, his eyes glistening. "Arthur, can you see this? Your granddaughter is every bit the warrior you were. A born leader!"

William and Eleanor clasped hands, overcome with emotion. "Our son chose well. She's the daughter-in-law we always dreamed of!"

Meanwhile, Julian Blackwood's stomach twisted with dread. Damn, is Grandfather serious? He just handed Vivian an entire battalion. If he ever learns the truth, I'm finished.

The entourage piled into their cars, heading toward an upscale restaurant in Edinburgh.

Eleanor had already embraced Vivian as family. She hadn't let go of her hand the entire ride, eagerly pointing out landmarks. "See that luxury mall? Ours. That skyscraper? Also ours. Even the broadcasting tower in the distance—we own five local stations."

Vivian was impressed. The Blackwoods' influence rivaled the Lockhart dynasty. But while the Lockharts ruled Newport City—a bustling hub driving national commerce—Edinburgh was a quieter stronghold, its resources controlled by a select few.

Both families were titans, yet historical grudges had made them adversaries. Thankfully, their territories never overlapped… until now. Vivian might just become the spark that ignited war.

Frederick raised his glass at the head of the table. "You've endured too much. I heard how the Blackwoods mistreated you—even cast you out. You may forgive, but I won't tolerate such disrespect." His voice hardened. "I declare war on the Blackwoods. Your honor will be avenged!" He downed the wine in one gulp.

Vivian's blood ran cold. "Your support means everything, but please—this isn't necessary. My choices were my own. Now that I've divorced Nathaniel, That chapter is closed!"

Frederick shook his head. "Your kindness is your weakness. I owe Arthur this. The Blackwoods will pay."

Vivian's pulse raced. Is he serious? What exactly is he planning?

Before she could protest, a waiter entered, stammering, "F-forgive the interruption, but... there's a guest requesting to join you. Shall I permit them?"
###Chapter 316

"Who has the audacity to make such a demand?" Frederick slammed his fist on the table, glaring at the waiter. "Fine, let them in. It's been too long since someone dared challenge the Blackwoods in Edinburgh!"

Vivian's gaze flicked to the entrance, intrigued by this bold stranger. The Blackwoods ruled Edinburgh with an iron fist—who would be reckless enough to provoke them?

The banquet hall doors swung open. A woman in a silk gown that cost more than most cars glided in, a limited-edition Hermès Birkin dangling from her wrist.

"Uncle Baldwin," she purred, placing her designer bag on the table like a declaration of war. "I flew all the way from Newport City just to see you. Won't you indulge me with dinner?"

Gasps rippled through the room. This was Eleanor Whitmore—Vivian's former mother-in-law.

Vivian's grip tightened around her wineglass. "Mrs. Whitmore," she said carefully, "this is Edinburgh." The unspoken warning hung heavy: You're in enemy territory.

Eleanor's eyes lit up with faux surprise. "Vivian, darling! What a delightful coincidence!" She clasped her hands dramatically. "Did I hear you call me 'Mom' earlier? Do say it again!"

Vivian barely suppressed an eye-roll. They'd literally had lunch yesterday.

Across the table, Eleanor Kingsley shot to her feet. "Enough!" she snarled, pointing at the door. "That divorce was public. Vivian is marrying into the Blackwood family. Get out!"

Eleanor Whitmore merely poured herself a glass of Bordeaux, swirling the crimson liquid with a smirk. "So hostile, Eleanor. Weren't we inseparable as girls? We even shared tastes in... everything." Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "Including men."

The wine bottle trembled in Eleanor Kingsley's grip. "Shut your mouth!"

"Oh, but it's such a nostalgic story!" Eleanor Whitmore continued, blissfully oblivious to the murderous glares. "Remember how we both loved Nathaniel's father? I nearly let you have him—until he begged to marry me instead." She sighed wistfully. "Twenty years, and you're still bitter?"

"You disgraceful—"

"Mom." Vivian cut in sharply before blood could be shed.

Eleanor Whitmore clinked her glass against Vivian's with a wink. "See, darling? Our generation's love stories put yours to shame."
###Chapter 317

Vivian forced an awkward smile, uncertain how to react. She'd always known Margaret had a superiority complex, but this level of audacity was unexpected.

Had Margaret really come just to flaunt her connections?

"Insolence!" William slammed his fist on the table, his expression thunderous. "Do you forget this isn't Newport City? You're standing on Baldwin territory. One more word upsetting my wife, and I won't hesitate to teach you a lesson."

Margaret rolled her eyes dramatically. "Oh, how terrifying. William, we were childhood sweethearts. Your wife and I used to be inseparable. Is this how you treat old friends?"

"You—" William's knuckles turned white as he raised his fist.

Vivian immediately stepped between them. "Uncle William, she's not worth your anger. Miss Whitmore has the emotional intelligence of a toddler. Arguing with her is pointless."

Years in the Blackwood household had taught Vivian patience. Margaret wasn't evil—just insufferably blunt with a talent for provocation.

Ironically, Margaret was Harborview City's most generous philanthropist, donating millions annually. That's why Vivian never truly resented her, despite the constant bullying.

"Listen to Vivian," Eleanor sneered, placing a restraining hand on her husband's arm. "Don't lower yourself to a madwoman's level."

Vivian turned to Margaret. "This is a private family gathering. As an outsider, you should leave."

Her harsh tone concealed genuine concern. The Baldwins ruled Edinburgh like royalty, with military power backing their influence. Even the Blackwood name wouldn't protect Margaret here.

"Private?" Margaret's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "You're not family either, yet you're sitting pretty."

Vivian exhaled sharply. Some people just couldn't be saved.

Coddled her entire life, Margaret had zero survival instincts.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Margaret, any blood ties between Whitmores and Blackwoods ended with your marriage. State your business or suffer the consequences."
###Chapter 318

Margaret Whitmore arched a perfectly sculpted brow, setting down her wineglass with deliberate slowness. "In that case, I'll be blunt. I came to Edinburgh for one purpose—to take my daughter-in-law home."

The air in the room thickened instantly. Every Baldwin at the table stiffened, their expressions darkening like storm clouds.

"Vivian grew up in Newport City," Margaret continued, her voice dripping with condescension. "A thriving metropolis with endless opportunities. Edinburgh, on the other hand, is a backwater with crumbling infrastructure and third-world transportation. I won't stand by while she wastes her life here."

The Blackwoods' collective glare could have melted steel. Silence stretched taut between them, charged with unspoken threats.

Vivian's fingers tightened around Margaret's sleeve. "Mrs. Whitmore, please stop," she hissed. "You're insulting their home."

Margaret scoffed. "Facts aren't insults. Check any global wealth ranking—Newport dominates while Edinburgh scrapes the bottom. Should I pretend otherwise?" She seized Vivian's wrist and stood. "Enough history. Nathaniel still loves you. Come home, and you can rebuild your future together!"

"I said no." Vivian wrenched free, her voice sharp as shattered glass. "Didn't Nathaniel tell you? At the airport, I chose Julian. That's why I returned to Edinburgh with him. It's over. Stop harassing me."

"Lies!" Margaret's shrill protest echoed through the dining hall. "You adored Nathaniel for years! This is just petty revenge because the Blackwoods mistreated you. But the Baldwins?" Her laugh was brittle. "They're wolves in silk suits. Marry into this family, and you'll regret it forever."

Eleanor Kingsley slammed her palms on the table. "Enough!" She snapped her fingers toward the door. "This lunatic just slandered the Blackwood name in our own home. Confinement room. Now."

Two armed guards materialized, seizing Margaret's arms.

Vivian lunged forward. "Wait! There's no need for—"

Eleanor's smile was venomous. "Darling, don't interfere. Our rules apply to everyone in Edinburgh. Letting her go would make the Blackwoods appear weak."

Vivian's gaze darted to Frederick and William, who sipped wine with detached amusement. The puppeteers letting Eleanor play executioner.

Just like the rumors said—the Blackwoods ruled Edinburgh like monarchs, their power more absolute than she'd ever imagined.

Julian's hand settled on her shoulder. "Relax. She needs this humbling. No permanent harm done."

"Precisely." Frederick dabbed his lips with a napkin. "Consider it dinner theater. Don't let it spoil your appetite."

Vivian forced herself to finish the meal, each bite ash in her mouth.

She'd walked into the lion's den willingly.

Now the claws were out.
###Chapter 319

The moon hung high when they reached Pinecrest Manor. The estate was a sprawling Elizabethan masterpiece, its four courtyards arranged in perfect symmetry—north, south, east, and west. Each quadrant boasted intricate pavilions, gilded railings, and marble accents that shimmered under the lantern light.

Vivian's quarters were in the East Wing, adjacent to Julian's.

"Listen carefully, Julian," Eleanor Kingsley said sternly before retiring for the night. "Make sure Vivian feels at home here. I want her to imagine this as her future."

Julian sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Relax, Mother. I'll take care of my girlfriend."

Eleanor arched a brow. "If she's your girlfriend, why are you putting her in a separate room? That's hardly convincing."

"Because she's not comfortable with that yet," Julian countered, gently steering his mother toward the door. "We're not married. Give her space."

A knowing gleam lit Eleanor's eyes. Good. Let them have their privacy. "Don't disappoint me, Julian."

Finally, the room fell silent, leaving only Vivian and Julian.

She crossed her arms, her expression tight. "Julian, be honest—was this a setup?"

His lips curved faintly. "Why would you think that?"

"You asked me to pretend to be your girlfriend. You didn’t mention your family would roll out the red carpet like I’m some royal bride." Her fists clenched. "They gave me a private guard detail. If I back out now, it’ll look like I scammed the Blackwoods."

Guilt gnawed at her. The Blackwoods' generosity made her deception feel vile. Worse, their influence was terrifying—crossing them wasn’t an option.

Julian closed the distance, his smirk deepening. "There’s an easy solution." His voice dropped to a murmur. "Stop pretending. Marry me for real. I meant what I said—I want you as the lady of Pinecrest Manor."

She shoved against his chest. "Stop joking! I don’t want to be some trophy wife. I just want a quiet life."

He caged her against the wall, his breath warm on her lips. "Scarlet," he murmured, tilting her chin up. "Even if you don’t want the title… don’t you want me?"
###Chapter 320

Julian Blackwood was undeniably handsome, but Vivian Lockhart barely knew him. His sudden closeness made her skin crawl.

She ducked under his arm and slammed him against the wall, twisting his wrist behind his back with practiced ease.

A pained grunt escaped Julian as his face pressed into the cold stone.

"Try that again," Vivian hissed, her breath hot against his ear, "and I'll break every bone in your pretty little hand."

"Damn—Vivian, let go!" Julian yelped, shocked by her strength. His shout echoed through the courtyard.

Eleanor Kingsley smirked from her hiding spot. "Perfect. He's playing his part well."

Inside the room, Vivian finally released him after a final warning squeeze.

"Scarlet Phoenix," Julian groaned, rubbing his sore wrist as he backed away. "Hacker, fighter, and absolute menace. What man would dare marry you?"

Her glare sharpened. "Keep talking. See what happens."

"Alright, alright!" He threw his hands up. "But you can't expect me to be silent all the time, can you?"

"I absolutely can." She folded her arms. "Now—what's your plan for Eleanor Whitmore?"

Julian's playful expression darkened. "Teach her some manners. Make sure she never forgets her place."

"Are you insane?" Vivian's pulse spiked. "She's Nathaniel's mother. The Blackwoods won't let this slide. Your little army might be impressive, but theirs isn't just for show. This won't end well for either family."

Julian scoffed. "There's always a winner and a loser. We've been dancing around each other for years. Time to stop pretending."

The Blackwoods had been itching for a fight. Eleanor had just handed them the perfect excuse.

"But—"

"Stay out of it, Scarlet." Julian straightened his jacket. "The Lockharts have no stake in this. Just sit back and enjoy the show."

He left before she could argue.

Vivian clenched her fists. She couldn't just wait around. If Julian made his move, this would spark a full-blown war.

There was only one solution: find where they were holding Eleanor and sneak her back to Newport City.

But the Blackwood estate was massive, and every inch was under surveillance. Where would they keep her?

"No time to waste." She yanked open her closet.
###Chapter 321

Vivian's breath caught when she opened the wardrobe. Every shelf overflowed with designer garments, each piece tailored to her exact measurements. The Blackwoods had practically raided every luxury boutique in Newport City for her.

Guilt twisted her stomach. Their generosity was overwhelming. After helping Margaret escape, she'd come clean and beg for their forgiveness.

She selected a black blouse and white slacks, then expertly altered them to mimic the Blackwood staff uniform. At the vanity, she applied aging makeup and pulled her hair into a severe bun.

"Perfect," Vivian murmured, admiring her disguise in the mirror. She looked every inch the Blackwood housemaid.

Moonlight bathed the estate grounds.

A cluster of servants huddled near the east fountain, whispering furiously.

"Did you see how Master Nathaniel dotes on that woman? Old Mr. Blackwood treats her like royalty!"

"Rumor says she's barren. That's why her first marriage failed. Can you imagine? Our perfect Master Blackwood with a divorced woman?"

"Disgraceful! The family's standards are slipping."

Vivian's nails bit into her palms as she eavesdropped from behind a marble column. "Exactly," she hissed, stepping into view. "The Blackwoods deserve better than some used goods."

The servants jumped. "Who are you?"

Vivian bowed her head. "New staff. Please guide me."

Their posture immediately shifted to superiority. "The Blackwoods only hire the elite. You look... common. What's your assignment?"

"I'm guarding some prisoner," Vivian said, scratching her head with feigned confusion. "A woman who insulted the family? But I can't find the confession room..."

Understanding dawned on their faces. Not one questioned her story.

"Follow me," the head maid sniffed.

Vivian trailed behind, amazed at how easily they'd swallowed her lies.

Then the maid froze. She turned slowly, eyes narrowing. "Wait... your uniform. The stitching is wrong."
###Chapter 322

Vivian's pulse raced, but she maintained her composure. "Really? I don't see any difference. It's the same design, just different fabric."

"Same design, different fabric?" The maid ran her fingers over Vivian's sleeve and sneered. "This is genuine silk. No servant's uniform would ever be made from something this expensive!"

Sharp eyes. Even a Baldwin household maid is this perceptive. Vivian was impressed but unfazed.

She straightened her shoulders. "Perhaps it's an improvement. The Baldwins are one of the most influential families in the world—it makes sense they'd want their staff dressed well. Are you questioning their judgment?"

"No! That's not what I meant!" The maid paled. "The Baldwin family is beyond reproach. I'm simply being thorough."

"Should we ask Lady Eleanor to confirm whether she authorized this?"

"No need!" The maid wouldn't dare disturb the matriarch over something so trivial. She waved dismissively. "Enough chatter. Let's go."

They walked through the dim estate grounds until reaching a secluded courtyard. Hidden behind dense trees stood a weathered hut, its door marked with a sign: Confession Chamber.

"Your orders are simple—guard this place with your life. No matter what she says or does, don't open that door. Don't give her anything. Wait for further instructions," the maid commanded.

"She's in there?" Vivian eyed the crude structure skeptically. She'd expected something more imposing for a punishment chamber.

"What, were you hoping for a dungeon?" The maid smirked. "Lord Alfred says the worst punishment isn't physical—it's isolation. Locked in there, she'll lose all sense of time and connection to the world. Eventually, she'll beg for death."

"That makes sense, but how exactly does it work?"

"The walls are soundproof. No light, no sound—just four white walls and air. Half an hour in there feels like eternity. Three days? She'll be shattered."

A chill ran down Vivian's spine. That's horrifying.

She imagined the suffocating silence, the crushing weight of solitude.

Margaret is impatient and hot-tempered. She won't last three hours. Vivian clenched her fists. She had to act fast.

"Remember—betray the Baldwins, and you'll be next," the maid warned.

"Of course. My loyalty is absolute," Vivian lied smoothly, urging the maid to leave.

The moment the maid disappeared, Vivian rushed to the hut. Time was running out.
###Chapter 323

The maid finally left after studying Vivian's expression, convinced the young woman wouldn't attempt anything reckless.

The moment the door clicked shut, Vivian sprinted toward the isolated hut.

Its exterior appeared dilapidated, but the construction materials were cutting-edge. The frosted steel walls allowed one-way visibility.

Inside, Margaret Whitmore's every movement was visible - her furious screams, violent door pounding, angry stomping. Vivian even caught the undignified sight of Margaret picking her nose.

Yet Margaret remained completely blind to the outside world, seeing nothing beyond her white prison walls.

"Pathetic." Vivian pressed against the transparent wall, watching Margaret's meltdown with dark amusement. "This is what happens when you provoke the Blackwoods, you foolish woman."

Though she'd witnessed Margaret in humiliating situations before, this took the cake. There was something deliciously ironic about the proud socialite reduced to this state.

Vivian leisurely recorded Margaret's breakdown before turning her attention to the high-tech lock. The biometric security system would stump most people.

Not a world-class hacker like Scarlet Phoenix.

Her phone and Bluetooth device synced instantly. A holographic keyboard materialized in the air. Fingers flying, she bypassed firewall after firewall until the lock emitted a triumphant beep.

The door slid open silently.

Margaret whirled around, disbelief morphing into tearful relief. "Isabella! My precious daughter-in-law! You came for me!" She lunged forward, clutching Vivian like a lifeline. "I was dying of boredom in here! And I desperately need the ladies' room!"

Vivian barely suppressed an eye roll as Margaret babbled about her ordeal.

"Keep screaming," Vivian hissed. "Let's wake the entire Blackwood security team. That'll help our escape."

Margaret paled but stubbornly lifted her chin. "I'm not afraid of them!" Yet she bolted through the door the second Vivian stepped aside.

Vivian calmly reset the security system before joining Margaret outside. She pointed to a narrow drainage tunnel. "Guards patrol the main gate. This is our only exit. Move now while it's dark."

"No!" Margaret crossed her arms. "I won't leave without you. That viper Eleanor can't have you!"

Vivian blinked. Since when had Margaret developed maternal instincts toward her?

"Stop being childish," Vivian snapped. "The Blackwoods have been itching for war with the Lockharts. Your little stunt gave them the perfect excuse. We dominate business, but their military resources? We can't compete." She gripped Margaret's shoulders. "This is your one chance. Stay, and you'll destroy everything Nathaniel's built. Is that what you want?"
###Chapter 324

Margaret's words made Vivian pause. She exhaled sharply. "You're right. As much as I care about you, my son comes first. I can't risk causing problems for him."

"Finally, you're making sense!" Vivian's shoulders relaxed as she gestured toward the gap in the wall. "Go. Now."

Margaret gripped Vivian's hand, her expression serious. "Come with me. I won't leave you behind to face danger alone."

"I'm fine here," Vivian said with a dry laugh. "Honestly, it's better than being trapped in the Blackwood estate. They won't hurt me, but if I run with you? That's a different story."

Guilt flickered in Margaret's eyes. "The Blackwoods treated you horribly before... and for that, I'm sorry. I wasn't cruel to you because I hated you. I just thought you and Nathaniel were miserable together—two people forcing something that wasn't there. I wanted you to walk away." She swallowed hard. "I'm not a monster."

Her voice trembled. "I promise I'll never pressure you about children again. I'll never call you cursed. Just... think about coming back to Nathaniel. The Blackwoods will treat you better than the Baldwins ever could. I'll stand by you, no matter what." Tears glistened in her eyes.

Vivian's chest tightened. Margaret—proud, stubborn Margaret—was humbling herself.

For the first time, Vivian considered letting go of old grudges. She'd never truly hated Margaret. Now, seeing her like this, something shifted. A smirk tugged at her lips. "Honestly? 'Cursed' has a nice ring to it."

Margaret groaned. "Must you always be so difficult? I apologized! Can't you just forgive me?" She pouted like a scolded child.

Vivian arched a brow. "Maybe. I'll think about it. Go home and wait for my answer."

"Really?" Margaret's face lit up. "Nathaniel will be thrilled. That man's pride wouldn't let him beg, so I had to step in."

I was joking, Vivian thought wryly. She just needed Margaret to leave. Deep down, she knew—her time with Nathaniel was over. No second chances.

With a reluctant nod, Margaret crawled through the gap. Before disappearing, she muttered, "This is the most undignified thing I've ever done. If it weren't for you all, I'd have fought my way out."

Vivian bit back a laugh. "Oh, absolutely. You look very majestic crawling through a hole in the wall."

Once Margaret was gone, Vivian scooped dirt to conceal the gap. "Done." She dusted her hands off, turning—

And froze.

Julian stood there, arms crossed.

Vivian stumbled back. "How—how long have you been there?"

Dressed in black athletic wear, a headband holding back his sweat-dampened hair, Julian looked unfairly attractive. "Just got here. Out for a midnight run?"

"Run?" she echoed cautiously.

"Yeah. What else would I be doing?" His gaze dropped to the freshly covered hole. "And you? What's so interesting about this spot?"

"Nothing!"
###Chapter 325

Vivian hesitated before answering. "Your estate is stunning, so I wanted to explore."

She bit her lip. "But during my walk...nature called." The lie burned her tongue, but she had to maintain Julian's trust.

"Is that so?" Julian's lips curled into that infuriating smirk. "I should've joined you earlier."

"You're impossible!" Heat flooded Vivian's cheeks. The guilt made her lash out. "One more word and I'm leaving tomorrow. This arrangement ends."

"My apologies." Julian held up his hands in surrender. His gaze traveled over her maid's uniform. "Though I must ask...why the disguise? And that makeup..."

Vivian's hand flew to her bare face. "This is my natural look. Are you calling me ugly?" She plucked at the borrowed blouse. "And I found this in the closet. It's comfortable. What, do I look like staff to you?"

"That's not—" Julian faltered.

"Save it. I'm exhausted." Vivian spun on her heel before he could see through her lies.

As she stormed away, she felt Julian's amused gaze burning into her back.

The audacity of that man! She'd turned the tables beautifully, yet her pulse still raced with guilt.

Back in her guest suite, Vivian scrubbed off the theatrical makeup and changed into silk pajamas. The four-poster bed beckoned like a cloud.

Sleep claimed her instantly.

Then the nightmares began.

Nathaniel stood over her, a riding crop in hand. "Brave little wife," he purred, securing her wrists to the chair. "Marrying another man? You'll pay for this betrayal."

The crop cracked against marble. Then came the hiss of heated metal nearing her skin—

"No! I'll come home!" Vivian thrashed, limbs tangling in satin sheets.

"Shhh, it's alright." Cool fingers brushed her damp forehead. Eleanor's soothing voice pierced the terror. "You're safe here, darling."

Vivian blinked awake to find Eleanor perched on her bedside. In her groggy state, the older woman's kind eyes reminded her of long-lost maternal comfort.

"Mother..." Vivian clung to Eleanor's robe. "Stay with me. Please."

The facade of the unshakable heiress crumbled. At twenty-three, beneath the boardroom armor, she remained as fragile as hothouse orchids—only showing vulnerability to trusted souls.

"Such terrible dreams." Eleanor smoothed Vivian's hair. "The Blackwoods protect our own. No one will harm you here."

Reality crashed back. Vivian sat bolt upright. "Aunt Eleanor, forgive me."

Their quiet conversation lasted until a ringing phone shattered the moment.
###Chapter 326

Vivian's gut screamed it was Ethan calling when Newport City flashed on her screen. She considered ignoring it, but the relentless ringing forced her hand.

Sophia gave her an encouraging nod. Not wanting to raise suspicion, Vivian feigned calmness and answered.

"So you finally picked up." Ethan's glacial tone sent shivers down her spine.

Memories of her nightmare resurfaced, but she played dumb. "Insurance? Sorry, not interested." She hung up before he could finish.

"Damn telemarketers," Vivian lied smoothly while blocking the number. "They've been blowing up my phone lately."

But new numbers kept calling. Block after block, the calls persisted until she excused herself to the restroom.

"Have you lost your mind, Ethan?" she hissed into the phone. "You're my ex-husband. You shouldn't even have this number!"

A chilling pause. Then: "I didn't call to chat. Tell me - did my mother visit you? Is she safe?"

"She left Edinburgh hours ago!" Vivian's pulse quickened. Newport wasn't far - Margaret should've arrived by now. "Something must've happened."

"So she did come." Ethan's voice turned deadly. "I'm heading to the Blackwood estate now. If anything's happened to her, neither you nor the Blackwoods will survive this."

"You can't just—" The line went dead.

A knock interrupted her panic. "Everything alright in there?" Sophia called.

"Just checking in with my housekeeper," Vivian lied, emerging with forced calm.

Her mind raced. Ethan's arrival would ignite a war between families. She had to intercept him before—

"Come," Sophia beamed. "The Blackwoods are waiting to breakfast with you."

Vivian blinked at the midday sun. "They're still waiting?" Guilt twisted her stomach. She'd overslept, yet three generations of Blackwood men sat rigidly at the antique table, untouched European breakfasts before them, their military bearing unmistakable.
###Chapter 327

"Now that everyone's present and Vivian's rested, let's begin our meal." Eleanor gestured for Vivian to take her seat, her voice brimming with warmth.

"Good morning, Grandfather Frederick, Uncle William, and Julian." Vivian offered them a polite smile, her manners impeccable.

"Did you sleep well?" Frederick studied Vivian with growing admiration. Each glance only deepened his fondness for her.

"Very well, thank you for asking." Vivian nodded gracefully. Years navigating the Blackwood family had honed her survival instincts—masks were her armor.

"Really?" Julian barely suppressed a smirk. "Because I distinctly recall seeing you wandering the gardens at midnight. Even patched up a hole in the wall. Hardly the behavior of someone who slept soundly."

Vivian shot him a glare that could melt steel. Ungrateful brat. He knows exactly why I did it.

"A hole?" Frederick's expression turned glacial, reminiscent of a battlefield commander.

Vivian quickly explained, "The moonlight was breathtaking, so I took a stroll. Noticed some structural damage and fixed it. Insomnia and all."

Frederick gave a curt nod. "While you may rest today, remember—the Blackwoods adhere to military discipline. Routine strengthens the mind."

Vivian blinked. What?

"You're military stock, Isabella. Arthur would approve," Frederick added, referencing her late grandfather.

Vivian gulped. Arthur had drilled her in combat tactics, bomb disposal, even troop training—but spoiled her rotten otherwise.

"Enough, Grandfather," Julian interjected. "We're not even officially together yet. Don't scare her off."

"Ignore him," Julian continued, waving a hand. "As my wife, you'll keep whatever hours you please. Discipline is overrated."

Eleanor beamed in agreement. "Exactly! Happiness matters most—we won't impose rules."

Frederick's jaw tightened, but before he could argue, a maid burst in, frantic. "Eleanor's vanished!"

"Vanished?" Frederick's fork clattered against his plate. "Explain."

"The room was empty this morning. No signs of forced entry—like she evaporated!"

"Preposterous," Frederick snapped.

William frowned. "Unless someone released her, how does a person disappear?"

The maid gasped. "The new maid! It must've been her!"
###Chapter 328

"Stop this nonsense! Speak clearly!" Eleanor snapped.

The maid inhaled sharply before explaining. "Last night, a new maid arrived—wearing a uniform finer than ours. She claimed she'd been sent to watch Margaret. I led her to the room and left her there alone... But now, both she and Margaret are gone! She must be the one who helped her escape!"

"How dare she?!" Frederick's face darkened with fury, his family's authority blatantly challenged. "Who is this reckless fool? Sneaking into Pinecrest Manor right under my nose? She'll learn the hard way—no one crosses the Baldwins! Launch an investigation immediately. When you find her, break every bone in her body!"

William gave a sharp nod, turning to the head guard. "Why are you standing there? Seal the estate! Search every inch until you drag that traitor out!"

Isabella kept her face buried in her arms, barely breathing. If the maid recognized her now, she was done for.

Watching the guards storm off in armored vehicles, her throat tightened. Are they serious? Would they really cripple me if they found out?

But then again, it made sense. The Baldwins ruled Edinburgh—and all of Vienna—with an iron fist. Brutality was their language.

"Let's eat. We won't let this ruin Isabella's breakfast," Eleanor interjected smoothly.

The family rose, voices booming as they sang the national anthem in unison.

Isabella barely suppressed an eye-roll. No wonder Julian fled to become a hacker. I'd run too if I were stuck in this circus.

She'd planned to confess after breakfast, beg for mercy, then bolt from this gilded prison. The sooner, the better.

But then—

The maid, who'd been standing meekly, suddenly lifted her head. Her eyes locked onto Isabella, widening in recognition. "It's her! She's the impostor! The one who freed Margaret!"

The entire Baldwin family turned as one.

The maid jabbed a finger at her. "She disguised herself well, but I'd recognize those eyes anywhere. And that mole beneath her left eye—it's identical!"

Isabella's stomach dropped. Damn it. I forgot to cover the mole.

Of course, even their maids had sniper-like observation skills.

"Isabella," Eleanor said gently, resting a hand on her shoulder. "Tell us the truth. If it was you, confess—we won't punish you. But if this maid is lying..." Her voice turned icy. "...she'll regret it."

Isabella opened her mouth—

Then Julian, silent until now, cut in. "Enough. No need for theatrics. I let her go."
###Chapter 329

"What kind of nonsense is this?" Eleanor glared at him. Given Frederick's temper, he never hesitated to punish anyone who disobeyed him. Was Julian Blackwood trying to get himself killed?

Julian shrugged casually. "I'm telling the truth—I was the one who let her go. Think about it. The password is so complex that only a Baldwin would know it. Vivian is just an ordinary woman. Even if she wanted to escape, she’d never crack it." He shot Vivian a knowing smirk.

"Ha!" Vivian avoided his gaze and forced an awkward laugh. She was grateful he took the blame, but his smugness made her want to smack him.

Julian turned to his family. "Look, we’ve already taken Ethan Blackwood’s wife. Locking up his mother too would be excessive. The Blackwoods are powerful—money means they can hire assassins from Berlin or Vienna if pushed too far. Let’s not escalate this. We need room to maneuver later."

"Well said!" Vivian couldn’t help but stand and clap. It was like Julian had voiced her exact thoughts.

The Baldwins were too arrogant, but Julian had traveled the world. He understood diplomacy.

Frederick’s expression darkened. "You’re undermining our family’s reputation to flatter our enemies. If we back down now, we look weak!"

"The Baldwins and Blackwoods are destined for war. I held back before because Vivian was with them. But now? There’s nothing stopping us."

Vivian wanted to bang her head on the table. Frederick was a warmonger. The three brothers had split years ago over this exact issue—their principles clashed, and the fallout had been brutal.

Compared to him, her grandfather and Alfred Blackwood had been pragmatic. They avoided unnecessary fights, which was why they’d left the military for business.

She knew Frederick wasn’t evil—just ruthless. Order came first, no matter the cost.

Beneath his grandfatherly smile was a man who’d crush anyone who crossed him. Dealing with him was like handling a live grenade.

Vivian treaded carefully. Provoking him meant disaster. Letting Ethan meet him? Even worse.

Neither option worked. So she chose a third.

"Let’s fight! We have to fight!" she declared suddenly, raising her fist with dramatic fervor.
###Chapter 330

Vivian's unexpected outburst left the entire room in shock, particularly Julian. This reaction was the last thing he'd anticipated from her.

"You're seriously suggesting we declare war between our families?" His eyebrows arched in amusement as he posed the question.

"Absolutely!" Vivian's eyes sparkled with fervor. "My grandfather always dreamed I'd command troops like he did. If the Blackwoods and Lockharts are destined to clash - whether in boardrooms or battlefields - I demand to lead the charge! Besides..." Her voice turned icy. "I've got unfinished business with the Blackwoods. That bastard Nathaniel... I'd relish facing him in mortal combat."

"Magnificent!" Frederick clapped his hands, his laughter booming through the study. "Now this is the Lockhart spirit! Arthur's granddaughter through and through - bold, decisive, everything my cowardly grandson isn't." He shot Julian a disapproving glare. "When will you grow a spine, boy? At this rate, she'll be protecting you instead!"

Eleanor's lips pressed into a thin line as she stared daggers at her son.

Julian tugged Vivian aside, hissing through clenched teeth, "Have you lost your mind? I just smoothed things over! This was supposed to be a joke between my grandfather and father. Are you actually considering -"

Vivian cut him off with a laugh. "You're the one who blackmailed me into this, remember? Threatening to expose Scarlet Phoenix to Nathaniel unless I joined your little crusade. Now you're getting cold feet?"

"This was just a test to see where your loyalties lie with the Blackwoods." Julian pulled her close in a mock embrace, whispering urgently against her temple. "But this act of yours... it reeks of deception. Are you trying to sabotage us from within? Because if my grandfather discovers your schemes, not even I can save you."

Vivian responded with a dazzling smile, playing the doting fiancée to perfection.

Frederick beamed at William and Eleanor. "I retract my earlier statement - the boy's done well for himself. This woman will bring glory to our family name! With her at our side, the Blackwood legacy will reach new heights."

"Grandfather Blackwood," Vivian interjected suddenly, "as my grandfather's closest comrade, you must remember his pre-battle ritual?"

Frederick frowned. "What ritual?"

"Before every major campaign, he'd make offerings to heaven, earth... and the War Deity."

"The War Deity?" Frederick's confusion deepened. "I witnessed the celestial rites, but never any war god worship."

"Because it was his secret weapon." Vivian lowered her voice dramatically. "At the southernmost tip of the Coral Sea stands an ancient statue of the War Deity. Grandfather's childhood patron. Before every decisive battle, he'd journey there to receive divine blessing - ensuring his victory."

Frederick stroked his beard thoughtfully. "I don't recall Arthur ever mentioning this..."

"It was a Lockhart family secret." Vivian's expression turned solemn. "Now that I'm leading the Blackwood forces against Nathaniel's family, we must honor this tradition. I propose we depart immediately for the Coral Sea to seek the War Deity's favor!"
###Chapter 331

Nathaniel's eyes blazed with fervor. "Exactly! We must pay homage to the God of War."

His voice carried the weight of a solemn vow. "Consider this our unwavering pledge. To the helicopters—we depart immediately!"

"Yes! Let's move now!" Vivian cheered, her arms raised in excitement.

Internally, she exhaled in relief. Just as she'd predicted, Frederick Baldwin was impulsive to the point of arrogance. He'd swallowed her story about worshipping the God of War without question.

This way, the Baldwins and Ethan would never cross paths. Later, she could fabricate some excuse to prevent their confrontation. Perfect.

A smug smile curved Vivian's lips. She truly was a master of improvisation.

Just then, the butler hurried in, his expression tense. "General Baldwin, forgive the interruption, but... there's someone outside demanding to see you. Someone... significant."

Frederick scoffed. "Stop trembling. Who is this so-called 'big shot'?"

Before the butler could reply, the doors burst open.

A towering figure strode in, effortlessly bypassing the armed guards.

Ethan Blackwood, clad in an immaculate black suit, moved with lethal grace. His sharp features could've belonged to a Hollywood leading man, but the danger in his gaze was unmistakable.

Despite being outnumbered, his presence alone paralyzed the guards. They stood frozen, weapons useless in their trembling hands.

Vivian's blood ran cold. "How did he get here so fast? Does he have a teleportation device?"

Harborview City and Edinburgh were continents apart. Even by private jet, the trip took hours. Only one explanation existed—he'd arrived in Edinburgh before her.

Her plan had failed spectacularly. The worst-case scenario was unfolding before her eyes.

She wanted to shake him. Ethan, are you insane? You walked straight into the lion's den! You're Margaret's son through and through.

Vivian suppressed a groan. She'd just sent Margaret away, and now an even bigger problem stood before her. At this rate, she'd have to leave Edinburgh permanently to escape these relentless people.

The Baldwins scrutinized Ethan with hostile curiosity.

Ethan met their gazes head-on, his expression turning glacial. The air crackled with impending violence.

Vivian stepped between them, grabbing Ethan's arm with forced cheer. "Everyone, meet my stone-hearted ex-husband, Ethan Blackwood. Let's be honest—we have unfinished business, which explains his... eagerness to track me down. My apologies for his rudeness!"

She discreetly pinched his wrist, begging him with her eyes to play along.

A ghost of amusement flickered across Ethan's stoic face. "Indeed. Our matters remain... unresolved."

Julian Blackwood's eyes narrowed. "And what exactly would those matters be?"
###Chapter 332

Ethan Blackwood stood before the crowd, his voice steady and resolute. "I'm here to finalize our remarriage, naturally."

He closed the distance between them in three strides, pulling Vivian Lockhart into a possessive embrace. His lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Sweetheart, you've been very naughty. Running off with another man isn't how wives should behave."

"Sweetheart?" Vivian's eyes widened in shock.

'This act is going too far,' she thought, her pulse quickening. The memory of last night's nightmare flashed through her mind - Ethan's hands around her throat, his eyes cold with murderous intent.

The Baldwins watched Ethan like predators circling fresh prey, but none dared make a move. The sheer intensity of his presence kept them at bay.

Frederick Baldwin slammed his revolver onto the table with a thunderous crack. "The Blackwood heir has impressive nerve - coming alone to steal what's ours. Tell me, boy, how do you think your grandfather Alfred would react if his last remaining heir died here today?"

Ethan's gaze flickered to the weapon, his smirk never faltering. He tightened his grip around Vivian's waist. "You misunderstand, Frederick. 'Stealing' implies taking what isn't yours. But Vivian is my lawfully wedded wife. I'm merely reclaiming what's rightfully mine."

"Insolent brat!" Frederick cocked the revolver with practiced ease, aiming directly between Ethan's eyes. "Semantics won't save you. My bullets never miss their mark - your grandfather should have warned you about that."

Vivian threw herself between them, arms spread wide. "Grandfather Baldwin! That revolver was a gift from my grandfather - not a tool for bullying!"

The room collectively held its breath.

Eleanor Kingsley paled, mouthing silent warnings. She knew better than anyone how quickly Frederick's temper could turn deadly - even toward family.

"What did you say?" Frederick's face darkened, his rage shifting focus to Vivian.

Vivian swallowed hard but stood her ground. "Since my husband has come for me, I won't resist any longer. There's something I must confess—"

"Vivian!" Julian Blackwood's warning came too late.

She'd already made her choice - self-sacrifice was the only way to prevent bloodshed.

With dramatic flair, Vivian covered her face, shoulders shaking with fabricated sobs. "We were deeply in love, but he betrayed me with another woman! In my anger, I divorced him and used Julian to make him jealous! But seeing him risk his life to come here... I'm moved beyond words. Despite knowing the Baldwins would kill him, he came anyway. How can I stay angry? I want to go home with my husband!"

Her performance stunned the room into silence. Even the sharp-minded Ethan found himself momentarily convinced, his arms tightening around her reflexively.
###Chapter 333

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he sank into deep contemplation. His piercing gaze, sharp as a wolf's, locked onto Vivian. "Let me get this straight—you've been manipulating Julian and our entire family from the start? This was all an elaborate scheme to deceive the Blackwoods?"

Vivian drew a shaky breath before nodding. "I... I'm truly sorry. I was wrong."

"Don't—!" Julian tried to intervene but it was too late. He slammed his fist against the table in frustration. "Damn it, Vivian! You're throwing everything away for that bastard!"

His knuckles turned white. Julian knew Frederick better than anyone—the old patriarch despised deception with a passion. When provoked, he became dangerously unpredictable. How would this end?

"Well, isn't this just perfect?" Frederick's voice dripped with venom as he leveled his revolver at Vivian. "I admired you. Respected you as Arthur's granddaughter. I would've given you everything. But betrayal?" His finger hovered over the trigger. "The Blackwood code is clear—traitors die."

Julian moved like lightning, shielding Vivian with his body. "That's our family law, old man. She's not one of us. If you're going to shoot, aim at me!"

"You think I won't?" Frederick sneered.

"Of course you will." Julian flashed a reckless grin. "The great Frederick Blackwood, putting bullets in his own flesh and blood. How very dramatic."

Eleanor shot to her feet. "Enough! Must you make this worse?"

William stepped forward, voice trembling. "Father, please. They're young and impulsive. Shouldn't we guide them rather than punish?"

The words gave the volatile patriarch pause. Slowly, he lowered the weapon. "Listen carefully, girl. You've got talent—more than your grandfather even. It'd be a waste to kill you." His eyes hardened. "Renounce Ethan. Marry Julian. Do this, and I'll spare his life."

Vivian's breath hitched. "You'd... let Ethan go?"

"I make no promises about the Blackwoods. But for you?" Frederick's mouth twisted into something resembling mercy. "Consider it a wedding gift."

Her nails dug into her palms.

'Perfect. Now I'm some bargaining chip in their war.'

But the alternative was death—for both of them.

Swallowing her pride, Vivian stepped forward. "I choose—"
###Chapter 334

Vivian's words were cut short as Ethan's fingers closed around her wrist like steel bands. "She won't be choosing anything—she's leaving with me."

Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel, dragging Vivian behind him.

"You insolent bastard!" Frederick Baldwin's patience snapped. His revolver clicked as he aimed it directly at Ethan's temple. "I should put a bullet through your skull right now!"

The surrounding guards raised their weapons in unison. One command from the old man, and both of them would be riddled with bullets.

Vivian's pulse spiked. She twisted against Ethan's grip. "Let go of me! There's no shame in retreating when you're outmatched. You might have a death wish, but I don't!"

Ethan's laugh was ice. "I don't need a woman to save my life, Vivian. That's not how this works."

She nearly choked on her frustration. This infuriating man! How many times have I pulled his ass out of the fire? And now he wants to play the hero?

Ethan turned back to Frederick, lips curling in a taunting smirk. "Go ahead, pull that trigger. But the second you do, every Baldwin training facility on this planet will be reduced to rubble. Are you really willing to gamble your entire legacy?"

Frederick's face darkened. "Nonsense! The Shadow Legion is untouchable. You're bluffing."

"Am I?" Ethan's voice remained eerily calm. "My grandfather anticipated your recklessness years ago. Explosives are buried beneath every one of your training centers. One signal, and your so-called invincible army vanishes in a blink. Test me if you don't believe it."

The blood drained from Frederick's face. The Shadow Legion comprised sixteen elite divisions stationed across the globe—their locations were top secret. How had the Blackwoods infiltrated them?

Those forces were the backbone of Baldwin power. Without them, the family's influence would crumble overnight.

Damn that Alfred Blackwood! Always ten steps ahead.

Ethan's smile turned razor-sharp. "My grandfather isn't cunning—he's prepared. Unlike you, he prefers peace. But cross him, and he'll burn your world to the ground."

Before Vivian could protest, Ethan hauled her past the stunned guards and out of the mansion.

They didn't stop until they reached The Grand Marquis. The penthouse suite doors locked behind them, and Vivian finally exhaled.

Free. Finally free from that gilded prison. The Baldwin estate had felt like stepping into a medieval dungeon. Another day there, and she'd have lost her mind.

Then she looked up.

Ethan's gaze pinned her in place, dark and predatory. The air between them crackled with something far more dangerous than anything they'd faced tonight.

Vivian swallowed.

Out of the frying pan... straight into the fire.

She edged toward the door. "If we're done here, I should go."
###Chapter 335

Vivian straightened her clothes hastily, eager to leave. "Oh, I forgot to mention. I released Miss Whitmore last night, so she should be safe now. Maybe you should check on her?"

"Unnecessary." Nathaniel's usual icy demeanor had melted away. He casually tossed his jacket onto the sofa, revealing his toned physique beneath the crisp white shirt.

Vivian's pulse quickened. She swallowed hard without realizing it.

He removed his platinum watch and set it on the table. Leaning against the edge with one arm, he said casually, "My mother arrived in Newport City last night. She's probably having tea with friends right now."

"Last night?" Vivian frowned. "Then why were you at the Baldwin estate this morning?"

Nathaniel lifted his gaze, lips curling into a knowing smirk. "What do you think?"

"I..." She bit her lip, heart pounding. His intense stare burned through her. Shaking her head violently, she snapped, "I don't care what game you're playing, but this is the last favor I'll do for the Blackwood family. Did you even consider the consequences of dragging me away like that? I'm probably on the Baldwins' blacklist now!"

Though the Baldwin family had strict rules, they'd always treated her kindly. They'd cherished her like precious treasure. Now they must be furious she'd left with their enemy without hesitation!

"This whole mess between the Baldwins and me wouldn't exist if you hadn't interfered. You've really screwed me over this time!"

"Is that so?" His gaze turned frosty, sharp as a blade. The man was fire and ice combined. "Are you blaming me for ruining your cozy relationship with Julian? Destroying your plans to become the next Mrs. Baldwin?"

Vivian stared in disbelief. This jealousy was so unlike him!

Tilting her chin up defiantly, she retorted, "Do you really think so little of me? That I'd be interested in any man who talks to me? You're being ridiculous!"

Like a proud swan, she smoothed her clothes and continued, "I've made myself clear, Nathaniel. Vivian Lockhart is her own person. I'm not some trophy for you and the Baldwins to fight over. Keep me out of your battles. I have things to do - goodbye!"

As she turned to leave, Nathaniel's quiet question stopped her. "If you truly didn't care... why did you shield me from that gun at the Baldwin estate? Isn't that contradictory?"

Vivian froze, speechless.

He was right. No matter how harsh her words, her instincts had betrayed her true feelings.

How could she not care? Watch him die? That wasn't who she was!

Nathaniel closed the distance, expression solemn. "I meant every word about remarrying you. Think about it."
###Chapter 336

Ethan's fingers twitched, aching to brush against Vivian's cheek, but he restrained himself.

The man who rarely spoke more than necessary was suddenly laying his heart bare. "It's true. Think it over carefully. I'll come for your answer at dawn."

Vivian's fists clenched briefly before she surprised him with a quiet nod. "Alright."

For the twins growing inside her, she would consider it—if he truly meant to start anew.

Once he left, she stood before the towering French windows, gazing down at the city lights. Her future stretched before her, demanding a choice.

Should I rebuild my family's legacy alone? Or return to the shelter of the Blackwood name?

Neither path came without sacrifice.

Her phone shattered the silence. An unknown number—not from Newport or Edinburgh, but Nordhaven.

The female voice on the line turned her blood to ice. Jaw clenched, she endured the pleasantries before snapping, "Fine. I'm coming."

Within the hour, Vivian arrived at Pinecrest Manor—Cassandra's gilded cage.

The mountain retreat was one of Blackwood Group's exclusive properties, its pristine forests and luxury facilities reserved for elite guests. Mist curled between ancient pines as the white European castle loomed ahead, a monument to obscene wealth.

Stepping from the car, Vivian was assaulted by the scent of roses. Acres of crimson blooms stained the horizon, framing Cassandra where she lounged in the garden.

Dressed in white, the woman hummed while trimming flowers—a picture of leisure.

Vivian's lips curled. "How cozy. Forgotten by the world, yet living like royalty."

Cassandra turned with a feline smile. "Troubles fade in places like this."

"You're not staying. You're hiding." The barb hit its mark.

Unfazed, Cassandra inhaled a rose's fragrance. "Jealousy doesn't suit you. Nathaniel never adored you like this, did he? His lawful wife?"

Vivian crossed her arms. "Do enlighten me. How exactly did he adore you?"

She'd play along—for now. The viper's performance was almost entertaining.
###Chapter 337

"Don't you see? Even though Nathaniel made me leave Blackwood Villa, he gave me this enormous castle instead."

Cassandra twirled the rose between her fingers, smirking at Vivian. "He tore out my rose garden at the villa, only to replace it with one ten times grander."

Her eyes gleamed with triumph as she gestured to the sprawling garden. "Every single seedling here was flown in from Vienna. Each one costs a fortune. This entire garden? Priceless. It's proof of Nathaniel's undying love for me!"

Vivian surveyed the sea of roses. The sight was undeniably breathtaking. "The Blackwoods certainly don't skimp on their displays of wealth."

Internally, her chest tightened. 'Of course this stings. How could it not? He never lifted a finger for me during our marriage, yet he showers her with extravagance? Losing to anyone would hurt, but Cassandra? That scheming viper? Unacceptable.'

"The Blackwoods are wealthy, but Nathaniel isn't reckless with his affections." Cassandra tilted her head, studying Vivian with mock pity. "I'm special to him. That's why he spoils me this way. But you..." She let out a theatrical sigh. "Four years as his wife, and not a single shred of his love. How pathetic."

"Enough!" Vivian's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Did you summon me here just to gloat? You think this proves he loves you? If he did, he wouldn't have hidden you away like dirty laundry. Face it—you're just an incubator for his heir. The moment that child is born, you'll be discarded."

"You're lying!" Cassandra's composure cracked. "He promised to care for us forever! This is temporary—just until the scandal dies down. Then he'll bring me home, restore my status, and marry me properly!"

Vivian stepped closer, her smile venomous. "Naive little fool. The Blackwoods would never accept a venomous snake like you. Without that baby, you're nothing. Even Eleanor Whitmore, your greatest ally, begs me daily to remarry her son. Face reality—you're already obsolete."

Each word struck like a whip. It was the brutal truth. Eleanor's sudden warmth toward her, Nathaniel's unexpected proposal—they'd all chosen the more valuable pawn.

The true tragedy was those who waited to be chosen. For a fleeting moment, Vivian almost pithered.

Then Cassandra snapped.

"Liar!" She lunged, fingers digging into Vivian's arms. "Eleanor despises you! There's no way she'd—"

Vivian shoved her away. "Get off me!"

Cassandra crumpled to the ground. A sharp cry tore from her lips. "My stomach—it hurts!"

Crimson bloomed across the soil beneath her.
###Chapter 338

"My stomach... it's tearing me apart!" Cassandra collapsed onto the marble floor, crimson pooling beneath her. Her trembling fingers clutched her swollen abdomen while the other hand reached desperately toward Vivian.

Vivian recoiled, her breath hitching. "This is an act. I barely touched you!"

She'd only meant to brush Cassandra's hand away. The way the woman crumpled like paper made Vivian's pulse spike. Had she really pushed that hard?

"Ms. Lockhart," Cassandra gasped, her face draining of color. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she curled inward. "I don't care about your intentions anymore. Just call an ambulance—save my baby!"

Vivian fumbled for her phone, fingers slick with panic.

Then a force slammed into her shoulder. Her phone skittered across the tiles as Nathaniel Blackwood stormed past.

His usual composure had shattered. The CEO cradled Cassandra against his chest, hands shaking visibly. "Stay with me," he ordered hoarsely, ignoring the blood soaking his tailored shirt. "Look at me, Cassandra. Breathe."

She clawed at his lapel, leaving scarlet streaks. "Nathaniel! She pushed me—your wife wanted us dead!"

Vivian rushed forward. "It was an accident, I swear—"

"Move." The single word carried such venom that Vivian stumbled back.

Four years of marriage, and she'd never seen those steel-gray eyes so murderous. The icy hatred in his gaze pinned her in place as he carried Cassandra toward the elevators, leaving bloody footprints in his wake.

Vivian stood paralyzed until the elevator doors closed. Only then did the first tear fall.

Nathaniel burst through the hospital doors, Cassandra limp in his arms. "Emergency! Now!"

Medical staff swarmed them, transferring Cassandra onto a gurney. The scent of copper filled his nostrils—too much blood, far too much. His vision swam as the hemophobia took hold.

"Sir? Sir!"

Darkness swallowed him whole.

Consciousness returned with the sterile sting of antiseptic. Nathaniel jerked upright, IV lines pulling taut. "The baby?" he demanded of the nearest doctor.

The physician hesitated. "Mr. Blackwood, we need to discuss—"

"Save them." Nathaniel's fist connected with the mattress. "Whatever it takes. That child is all I have left of my brother."

His vow hung in the air—a silent oath to the dead. Failure wasn't an option. Not when Tristan's last words had been, "Keep them safe for me."
###Chapter 339

Ethan Blackwood felt himself plunging into endless darkness.

Death's cold fingers brushed against his skin.

He struggled to climb out, but the void offered no handholds.

"Hold me!" His delirious whisper echoed in the emptiness.

Then warmth.

Small fingers intertwined with his, pulling him toward the light.

The voice came next - soft yet insistent. "Ethan, I'm here. You need to wake up now..."

His eyelids fluttered open.

Vivian Lockhart's worried face filled his vision.

"You're awake!" Her relieved exhale warmed his cheek.

Three days.

That's how long he'd been unconscious from his hemophobia episode.

Doctors had warned his organs were failing.

Only Vivian's stubborn voice had dragged him back from the brink.

His first words were ice. "Where's Cassandra? The baby?"

The flinch in Vivian's fingers betrayed her before she spoke.

"Cassandra remains in ICU under observation."

"The child?" His grip tightened on her wrist.

Vivian's gaze dropped.

"Tell me!" He shook her, desperation cracking his composure.

"You're hurting me!"

"Hurting you?" Ethan's laugh held no humor. "If that baby dies, pain will be the least of your worries."

The words left her lips like shrapnel. "Then prepare your revenge. The baby didn't survive."

Silence.

Ethan's face drained of color.

Vivian saw the exact moment hope shattered behind his eyes.

Part of her wanted to take it back. To comfort him.

Instead, she bared her throat. "Go ahead. Kill me. Isn't that what murderers deserve?"

A test. A terrible, twisted test.

Ethan's fingers closed around her neck.

The cold fury in his eyes was something new. Something deadly.

"Don't tempt me."

His whisper held the weight of a death sentence.
###Chapter 340

Ethan's fingers dug into Vivian's throat as rage consumed him. In that moment, he lost all control.

He needed an outlet for his guilt and fury. Rational thought had abandoned him.

Vivian couldn't speak through the pain. Her tear-filled eyes met his with eerie calm. She could fight back—but chose not to.

Cassandra had lost her child because of Vivian's mistake. If Ethan wanted her life as payment, she'd give it. Hers and the twins'. Better to die by his hand than drown in guilt forever.

Her vision darkened. Eyelids fluttering, she surrendered to the pain—

Then Ethan shoved her away, his last shred of control snapping the chain of his rage.

Vivian gasped, coughing violently. "You almost did it. Why stop?" Her voice scraped raw. "Don't you want justice for your dead child?" The desperate smile twisting her lips begged for punishment.

"Shut up!" Ethan's fists clenched. He hated her cruelty—but hated his own weakness more. He'd failed to protect his brother's last legacy. Failed to avenge an innocent life.

Pathetic.

"From today," he bit out, "we're strangers. I never want to see you again."

Vivian's heart shattered. She straightened, masking agony with icy pride. "Fine by me. Let's keep that promise."

She turned to leave—then paused at the door. "You had one chance to take revenge, Ethan. You won't get another."

"Get out," he snarled.

Neither imagined those angry words would echo for years—

Days later, Cassandra stabilized, moving from ICU to a regular ward. Ethan attended her meticulously, drowning guilt in duty.

Her body healed. Her mind didn't.

She refused food. Water. Sleep. When Ethan left, she'd scream—or reach for anything sharp.
###Chapter 341

The sedative had worn off.

Cassandra Delacroix spiraled into madness again.

"Let me die! Just let me die!"

She threw herself against the wall, her forehead already swollen and bruised. "My baby is gone!" she screamed, voice raw with agony. "There's no reason for me to live anymore!"

The nurses panicked. They called Nathaniel Blackwood immediately.

He dropped everything and rushed to the hospital.

Cassandra was hysterical. Nathaniel grabbed her, holding her tight. "Shh," he murmured. "It's going to be okay."

She collapsed against him, sobbing. "Nathaniel... Sebastian's child is gone. The last piece of him... gone."

Her voice broke. "They said my womb is damaged. I can never have children again. My life is over!"

Nathaniel gently guided her back to the bed. He pressed a warm towel to her bruised forehead. "Your life isn't over," he said quietly. "The Blackwood family will stand by you."

Cassandra's tears kept falling. "Do you know what Isabella Lockhart said to me? She told me the Blackwoods only see me as a breeding tool. That once I gave them an heir, I'd be discarded."

She clutched his arm. "She said Eleanor Whitmore prefers her because she's more valuable. That Eleanor wants her to marry you again. I just—I grabbed her hand, begged her to explain. And then she pushed me!"

Her voice cracked. "She killed Sebastian's baby, Nathaniel. She took everything from me. And now I can never have another child. How can you let her walk away?"

Nathaniel stayed silent.

Cassandra's grip tightened. "I'm not asking for revenge. Just an apology. Just for her to admit what she did!"

She sobbed. "She wanted me to kneel and apologize in public before. But now she's a murderer, and she gets to go free? Sebastian would never have let this stand!"

Nathaniel exhaled. He picked up the untouched meal tray. "You need to eat. You need to recover."

"Stop avoiding this!" Cassandra screamed. Tears streamed down her face. "Your brother's child is dead! He was a perfect little boy, and Isabella destroyed him! All I want is justice!"

She gasped for breath. "If you won't give me that, then let me die. Let me be with Sebastian and our baby!"

Nathaniel closed his eyes. This scene repeated nearly every day. The only way to calm her was another sedative.

The nurses entered, restraining Cassandra as the injection took effect.

Her body went limp. But her eyes—filled with pain and betrayal—locked onto Nathaniel's.

Guilt twisted in his chest. He couldn't run from this any longer.

"Fine," he said quietly. "When you're better, I'll make her apologize. She'll admit what she did."
###Chapter 342

The dim glow of the computer screen cast eerie shadows across the darkened study.

Nathaniel Blackwood's fingers hovered over the keyboard as he replayed the surveillance footage from Pinecrest Manor for the seventh time. His jaw clenched tighter with each repetition.

He needed to confirm Cassandra Delacroix's accusation. That Isabella's pride had caused the tragedy.

The video advanced frame by frame under his command. Each click of the mouse revealed Isabella's cruel taunts, her merciless shove, her cold indifference as Cassandra lay bleeding.

Nathaniel's knuckles turned white gripping the desk. The veins in his temples pulsed visibly. A guttural curse tore from his throat. "Goddamn it!"

He'd never considered Isabella evil before. Stubborn, yes. Strong-willed, absolutely. But this footage showed a side of her that turned his stomach.

How could she harm an innocent child? His child.

With trembling hands, Nathaniel snatched his phone and dialed Ethan Young. "Bring Isabella to Edinburgh immediately," he commanded, voice like ice. "She will apologize to Cassandra and explain herself to my family."

Even through the phone, Ethan could feel the storm of Nathaniel's rage.

But duty compelled honesty. "Mr. Blackwood... Miss Lockhart is gone."

"Gone?" Nathaniel's voice dropped dangerously low. "Where? Where would she go?"

"Unknown, sir." Ethan hesitated. "She came to me a week ago. Said her goodbyes. Mentioned she might never return to Harborview City. Prepared gifts for Blackwood Group staff. Left a message for you—"

Nathaniel's chest constricted. Was she running from guilt? Escaping without facing consequences?

Yet he vaguely recalled her mentioning departure plans before. He'd thought it empty threats. Now he realized—she'd been planning this all along.

"What message?" Nathaniel ground out, phone creaking in his grip.

"She apologized. Said she hopes your feud ends here. That she never wants to see you again." Ethan sighed. "The staff had bets on you reconciling. Looks like everyone loses."

Nathaniel scoffed. "Distraught? Don't be absurd."

A tempest of emotions raged within him—anger, betrayal, something disturbingly close to panic. One certainty remained: he wouldn't let her disappear.

Not like this.

"Find her," Nathaniel ordered. "Track every exit from the city. I want her brought to me."

For the first time in his life, Nathaniel Blackwood felt control slipping through his fingers.

Moonlight silhouetted his rigid frame against the floor-to-ceiling windows. A predator poised to strike.

"I tried, sir." Ethan's voice turned cautious. "Closed all city exits when you separated. But Miss Lockhart... she vanished. No trace. No leads."

"You're joking." Nathaniel's voice held deadly calm.

"No, sir. It's like she disappeared into thin air."
###Chapter 343

Ethan Blackwood's rage burned white-hot, his fingers twitching with the urge to wrap around Elijah Young's throat. His eyes narrowed to slits as he spat, "How the hell does someone just vanish? That's impossible!"

Elijah sighed, rubbing his temples. "We've turned this city inside out. No trace of Miss Lockhart. And her nanny, Evelyn Whitmore—gone too."

Ethan didn't wait. Within hours, his private jet touched down in Newport City.

He refused to believe Vivian Lockhart could disappear without a trace. She's still here. Hiding. His jaw clenched. He'd tear this city apart if he had to.

Every resource at his disposal was mobilized. His men scoured every district. Nathan Prescott and Dominic Harrington were summoned, their networks activated.

Nathan, freshly discharged from the hospital, met Dominic at Blackwood Villa.

Ethan stormed in, his voice razor-sharp. "Anything?"

The two exchanged glances before shaking their heads.

Nathan frowned. "Ethan, what the hell happened? Why'd she leave again?" Guilt gnawed at him—Vivian had saved his life, and now she was gone before he could even thank her.

Ethan's patience snapped. "Not now. Just find her."

Dominic stepped forward, calm but firm. "We need context. If we don't know why she ran, we're just spinning our wheels."

Nathan crossed his arms. "He's right. You're acting like a man possessed. If you screwed up, apologize. What's the point of this wild goose chase?"

Ethan's grip on the chair tightened. His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Because I nearly killed her. I told her never to show her face again."

Silence.

Nathan recoiled. "What?"

Dominic's expression darkened. "Ethan. That's domestic violence. No wonder she ran—you could've murdered her."

Nathan's fist clenched, fury boiling over. Vivian was fierce, brilliant, alive—and Ethan had choked her? He lunged—

Ethan's next words froze him mid-swing.

"Because she pushed Cassandra Delacroix down the stairs. She killed my brother's child."

Nathan staggered back. "Cassandra? Your brother's—what the actual fuck is going on?"
###Chapter 344

"I meant every word," Ethan stated flatly, his breathing even.

At this point, the baby and Vivian were gone. Whether the secret stayed hidden or came out no longer mattered.

"W-what?" Nathan stammered, stunned.

Dominic reacted similarly. It took him nearly ten minutes to process everything.

Finally, he exhaled sharply. "Nathaniel, you're an idiot. This must be eating you alive."

Ethan's voice was icy. "I'm fine. My brother saved my life. I owe it to him to fulfill his last wish—but I failed."

His fist slammed onto the table. His eyes burned with guilt over Sebastian.

"Of course you're fine. It's your wife who suffered!"

Nathan couldn't stay silent. "If you want to carry the guilt for Sebastian's death, fine. But why punish Vivian? You did everything for Cassandra and her child—what about Vivian? She was married to you for four years, and the moment she slipped up, you threw her out. You—"

"Enough!" Dominic snapped, cutting him off.

"Weren't you the one pushing Nathaniel to divorce her? Why the sudden change of heart? Do you want to make this worse? Hasn't he suffered enough?"

"That's not what I meant. I just feel for Vivian. What did she do wrong? She's—"

"I get Nathaniel."

Dominic's gaze softened as he took in Ethan's grim expression. "He wanted to give Cassandra legitimacy so her child could have a stable life. Besides, he didn't love Vivian then, and she didn't seem to love him either. A loveless marriage was doomed from the start. Her leaving was inevitable. Cassandra and the baby just sped it up."

Nathan rubbed his jaw. "Fair point. Everyone here is a victim. But I disagree about Vivian's feelings. Anyone could see she was in love with Nathaniel before!"

"Let's not dwell on the past. Focus on fixing the present."

Dominic turned to Ethan, who had been silent. "Nathaniel, have you thought this through? The baby's gone. You won't marry Cassandra now. Will you remarry Vivian?"

"Never." The answer came instantly. He'd rather stay alone forever than wed the woman who killed his brother's only child. Doing so would haunt him for life.

"Then why search for her? There's too much bad blood between you. Maybe it's best to let go and never see her again."

Dominic sighed. "No wonder she disappeared. I'd have done the same."

Nathan nodded. "Ethan, maybe you should stop looking. There's no future for you two. Dragging this out will only hurt you more."

Ethan seemed deaf to their words. His cold eyes lifted. "Did I go too far?"

Nathan blinked. "Huh?"
###Chapter 345

"I nearly strangled her. Was that too extreme?" Ethan demanded.

"Depends on how you look at it."

Nathan, the neutral observer, weighed in. "Given your track record, strangulation isn't the worst I've seen from you. But hurting Vivian? That crossed a line."

In all their years of friendship, Nathan had never witnessed the usually composed Ethan so unraveled. Though frustrated by his actions, the raw anguish in Ethan's eyes made him soften his tone.

"She had it coming!" Ethan's calm shattered like thin ice, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "A life for a life—that's justice."

Nathan recoiled, exchanging a glance with Dominic before sighing. "Fine, it's fair. So we're wasting resources tracking her down just so you can finish the job?"

Ethan's glare could've frozen lava. "We'll discuss her punishment once she's back where she belongs."

The two men shared another knowing look. They understood Ethan better than anyone.

Beneath that icy exterior was a man who felt too deeply—and hated himself for it.

"Enough delays. Let's find her."

Dominic pulled up a holographic map, tracing Vivian's last known movements. "According to the data, she was at Lockhart Manor, West Hill Cemetery, Lockhart Enterprises headquarters, Blackwood Group HQ... and finally, Blackwood Villa."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "So she vanished from our home?"

"Fifty-one hours ago, yes." Dominic projected the timeline onto the screen.

Nathan cracked his knuckles. "Two days is manageable. We'll find her—she can't have gone far."

A sudden thought struck him. "What if she's still there? Vivian's clever enough to hide right under our noses, waiting for us to drop our guard."

Dominic nodded. "Plausible. We should sweep the villa again with more manpower."

Ethan studied the glowing trail of Vivian's whereabouts, his expression unreadable. "Do it."

The thought of her slipping through his fingers was unacceptable.

Blackwood Villa sprawled across acres of land. The trio split up—Ethan took the interior while Nathan and Dominic combed the grounds.

Ethan stormed upstairs to Vivian's bedroom. The moment he opened the door, her signature gardenia scent enveloped him.

He didn't know when he'd first noticed that fragrance. They said love had a smell—this was hers.

Whether he loved her or not didn't matter. That scent was his anchor, the only thing that ever calmed the storm inside him.

The empty room mocked him. His fingers curled into fists. "Vivian," he growled to the silence, "where the hell are you hiding?"
###Chapter 346

Ethan Blackwood knew deep down that Vivian Lockhart couldn't possibly be staying at Blackwood Villa.

Yet a stubborn part of him clung to the irrational hope that maybe, just maybe, she was.

It was almost laughable.

The man who once made decisions with cold precision now found himself hesitating over something so simple.

What had happened to his logic? His control?

Ethan stepped into the bedroom, his fingers trailing over the silk duvet as if tracing the memory of her.

The way her hair spilled over the pillows. The soft curve of her cheek. The warmth of her skin beneath his touch.

Every thought led back to her.

Vivian smiling at him. Vivian furious, her eyes flashing. Vivian yelling, her voice sharp with defiance. Vivian turning away—walking out of his life without a single glance back.

The emptiness inside him was a black hole, devouring everything in its path.

"Damn it."

He exhaled sharply, forcing himself to snap out of it.

His life shouldn’t unravel just because one woman left.

Especially not her.

Not the woman who had played him for a fool.

Gritting his teeth, he turned to leave—to escape this room that reeked of memories.

Then he saw it.

A notebook on the shelf, bound in soft vellum, its cover embossed with delicate patterns.

A small lock secured its secrets.

A diary?

Vivian’s diary?

His pulse quickened.

Without thinking, he grabbed it, fingers working the lock.

Wrong code.

Again.

Still wrong.

Frustration flared.

With a sharp twist, he broke it open.

For a second, guilt flickered.

Diaries were private. Sacred.

But he was past reason.

He flipped it open.

Not a diary.

A manuscript.

Their story.

The one he’d stumbled upon online—the one that vanished before he could finish it.

He’d searched for weeks, never finding it again.

And now here it was, in her handwriting.

Neat. Precise. Unmistakably hers.

He remembered the first chapter—their first meeting.

The second was titled Falling.
###Chapter 347

"I never believed in love at first sight until it happened to me."

Our meeting was like something out of a fairy tale—beautiful, magical, destined. But what followed was nothing short of a nightmare.

He didn’t love me.

I knew that.

Yet, he married me anyway.

That’s why I understood the coldness, the distance, the way he barely looked at me.

He had dreams, ambitions, a whole life planned—one that didn’t include me.

Still, when we stood before the priest, exchanging vows, sliding rings onto each other’s fingers, I cried.

Happy tears.

Foolish tears.

I dreamed of carving out even the tiniest space in his heart, no matter how long it took.

He froze when he saw me sobbing.

Disgust flickered in his eyes, but he wiped my tears away anyway.

Cold hands.

Gentle touch.

That was the moment I fell.

I imagined married life would be different.

Lazy evenings curled up on the couch, watching trashy TV.

Building ridiculous Lego castles together.

Gaming side by side, laughing when we lost.

Feeding stray kittens in the alley behind our apartment.

Him actually eating the meals I cooked.

Then falling asleep in each other’s arms, fingers tangled together.

But reality?

"Wait."

That was his favorite word.

Wait for him to come home.

Wait for him to have dinner.

Wait for him to be free.

Most nights, I fell asleep alone.

Days turned into weeks, then months.

My love for him faded like a dying ember—until he’d smile at me, just once, and it would flare back to life.

A single glance.

A murmured "good morning."

That was all it took to undo me.

Pathetic.

I loved him too much.

chapter Four, Five, Six...

Ethan Blackwood didn’t move as he read.

His grip on the pages tightened.

Every word was a knife twisting deeper.

He never knew Vivian could write like this—raw, honest, devastating.

Their marriage, laid bare in ink.

Her love.

His cruelty.

Her pain.

His indifference.

"Bullshit."

The curse tore from his lips before he could stop it.

No wonder this novel was a bestseller.

Readers probably screamed at the pages, demanding justice for the heroine.

Because it hurt.

Even knowing he was the villain, even hating himself for it, he couldn’t stop reading.

Then—the twist.

A night changed everything.

A baby.

A slow, reluctant thawing of his heart.

"I bumped into him in the kitchen. His cheeks were flushed, breath warm with alcohol. Before I could speak, he cradled my face and kissed me like he meant it."

Ethan’s throat went dry.

The scene burned in his mind, vivid as memory.

He flipped the page, hungry for more—

Only to hit the end.

"Damn it."

He searched frantically, as if she’d hidden the rest somewhere.

But no.

That was it.

The notebook slipped from his fingers.

Four seasons of emotion in a single read.

He never realized how much she loved him.

Or how badly he’d failed her.

Love doesn’t fade overnight.

But now he understood why she walked away.

"Ethan!"

Nathan Prescott burst in, eyes alight. "You’re not going to believe this!"
###Chapter 348

Nathaniel Blackwood's icy gaze locked onto Nathan Prescott. His eyes blazed with sudden intensity.

"Are you certain?"

"My team just confirmed it. They spotted your wife at Harbor Market's antique district. Here—" Nathan fumbled with his phone, enlarging a grainy photo. "Look."

The side-profile shot was unmistakable.

That elegant nose, those sharp cheekbones—identical to Vivian Lockhart's.

Even the white dress matched one she'd worn before.

The blurry image was enough to ignite Nathaniel's pulse. He didn't hesitate.

"Let's go."

Dominic Harrington stayed behind at Blackwood Villa as backup.

Nathan noticed Nathaniel clutching a notebook like a lifeline.

"Is that classified intel?" Nathan prodded. "Why death-grip it?"

"No." Nathaniel stared out the car window, jaw tight.

Nathan smirked. "Then what? A secret admirer's love letters?" He reached—only to freeze at Nathaniel's warning glare.

"Wait—that's a girl's notebook. With a lock. But you picked it..." Nathan's eyes widened. "Holy hell. Is this her diary? Nathaniel Blackwood, you absolute creep! Since when do upstanding CEOs violate privacy laws?"

"Shut. Up." Nathaniel's knuckles whitened around the notebook.

"Come on, share the scandal! I'll be your accomplice. When we find Vivian, my lips are sealed—"

"It's not a diary." Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Half the internet's seen it."

"Then what?" Nathan leaned in. "If it's not secrets or sappy confessions—"

"You really want to know?" Nathaniel's voice dropped.

"Obviously."

"Promise me one thing first."

"What?"

"You'll find out after reading it."

Nathan snatched the notebook.

His eyebrows shot up.

"What kind of toxic hero is this? Someone drown him already—"

"Wait, they have a baby? Adorable."

"—AND THEY KISSED! FINALLY!"

Nathan devoured the pages, cycling through outrage, delight, and the giddy excitement of a teenager.
###Chapter 349

Nathaniel's emotions burned just as fiercely as Ethan's. "Seriously? That's where it ends?"

Nathaniel flipped through the notebook violently, pounding his chest in frustration.

"It was just getting good! Who wrote this garbage? They deserve to be flogged in the town square!"

Ethan subtly inched away, wary of Nathaniel's flailing arms. After multiple re-reads, realization struck.

"Ethan...are these characters supposed to be you and your ex-wife?"

Ethan rolled his eyes. "Who else would they be?"

"Did Vivian write this? Is any of it true?"

"About fifty percent," Ethan admitted.

Though some details were embellished, the emotional core mirrored their real-life marriage with unsettling accuracy. Nathaniel's grip on the notebook tightened like it was sacred scripture.

"I never knew Vivian could write like this! I nearly cried reading it."

Ethan's chest puffed up with misplaced pride. "Told you. She's a genius—excels in both arts and sciences."

"Incredible! Color me impressed!" Nathaniel exhaled sharply.

"Ethan, divorcing her was a mistake. Letting her go is like waving prime rib before starving wolves. There's a line of men waiting for her!"

Ethan smirked. "Not just anyone can handle her. You think she's easy prey?"

"From your tone, you wouldn't care if another man succeeded?"

Ethan shrugged. "Why should I?"

"What if that man is me?" Nathaniel's teasing grin didn't reach his eyes.

Ethan's gaze turned arctic. "Since when is she your type?"

"She's always been. I've got a thing for brilliant, icy women."

Nathaniel's voice dropped. "She saved my life once. The only way I can repay that debt is by devoting myself to her."

Ethan's jaw clenched. The temperature in the room plummeted.

"Just say the word, Ethan. If you're truly over her, I'll pursue her properly. But if you still have feelings—or plans to reconcile—I'll walk away right now."

Nathaniel's expression was dead serious. This wasn't banter between friends anymore.

Ethan's face darkened, murderous intent barely concealed beneath a veneer of indifference.

"Go ahead. You have my blessing."

"Say that again—I'm recording it!" Nathaniel whipped out his phone.

Ethan smacked it away. "Enough jokes. This isn't funny."

Nathaniel's laughter died. "I've never been more serious."

Years of friendship hung in the balance. Nathaniel had always idolized Ethan, but neither man would back down now. The air between them crackled with tension...
###Chapter 350

The tension was palpable as they pulled up to Harbor Market.

Nathaniel Blackwood smirked at Oliver Prescott with an unreadable expression.

"Oliver, how about a little wager? If you find her first, I'll accept she's yours and never pursue her again." His voice dropped lower. "But if I find her first...all bets are off."

"Whatever." Nathaniel shrugged indifferently.

"You're the most generous man in Newport City!"

Oliver practically leaped from the car, immediately scanning the crowds for any sign of Vivian.

Nathaniel exited with deliberate calm, straightening the cuffs of his tailored suit. His sharp gaze swept across the chaotic marketplace like a predator assessing its territory.

Harbor Market was the largest underground antique hub on the East Coast.

Situated at the crossroads of international smuggling routes, it attracted treasure hunters and criminals alike. Many had made fortunes here overnight.

But wealth brought danger. The market teemed with rival gangs and shady dealers.

Nathaniel moved through the throngs like a tourist. He paused at a weathered stall where an elderly vendor with a long white beard sat surrounded by artifacts.

Dusty relics covered the frayed cloth - bronze coins, cracked jade carvings, and pottery shards that reeked of freshly disturbed earth.

"Looking for treasures, sir?" The old man chuckled, stroking his beard. "My wares are genuine tomb finds. Pick anything - you won't be disappointed."

"I'm not here to shop."

The vendor's eyes gleamed knowingly. "Ah, searching for someone then. A man of your stature slumming here? Must be quite the woman."

Nathaniel neither confirmed nor denied.

"You've been here long enough to know everything that happens in these alleys."

The old man produced a bamboo cylinder filled with carved sticks. "For fifty dollars, the spirits will guide you. Ask your question and shake - the fallen stick holds your answer."

Just as Nathaniel reached for it, Oliver came barreling through the crowd.

"Are you sightseeing? I could've found her by now!" Oliver panted, glaring.

Nathaniel smirked. "Why rush? You'd only embarrass yourself."

"Is that a challenge?" Oliver bristled. "Who taught you how to chase women anyway?"

"Do you really think cheap tricks work on someone like her?" Nathaniel's voice was ice.

Oliver opened his mouth - then closed it. The truth stung. Vivian Lockhart wasn't some naive girl to be won over with flowers and sweet talk.

The old man watched their exchange with amusement. "Young love," he muttered, shaking his head. The bamboo sticks rattled ominously in their container.
###Chapter 351

Nathaniel Blackwood instantly felt exposed.

Vivian Lockhart wasn't like other women. Her sharp intellect cut through his facades effortlessly. This wasn't going to be as simple as he'd imagined.

After hours scouring the Harbor Market docks, Nathaniel still hadn't located Vivian. Frustrated, he finally sought out Ethan Blackwood for answers.

Trying to mask his discomfort, Nathaniel changed the subject abruptly.

"Ethan, what's with the bamboo tube? Some kind of magic act?"

Ethan ignored him, focusing intently on shaking the carved bamboo cylinder. After several vigorous shakes, a single stick clattered to the ground.

The elderly fortune-teller picked it up, his expression shifting as he read the inscription.

"What do you seek, young man?"

"I need to know if there's still a chance between us," Ethan stated coldly.

The old man exhaled slowly.

"The wind comes and goes; fate begins and ends in the heart."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

"Explain."

"Your connection remains unresolved. For four years, your paths may not cross. After that... it depends on you both. If the longing remains, reconciliation is possible. If either lets go, that thread severs forever."

The fortune-teller's words hung heavily in the air.

Ethan fell silent, absorbing this.

Nathaniel scoffed beside him.

"Typical fortune-teller nonsense. Covering all possibilities so you're never wrong."

He clapped Ethan's shoulder.

"Don't listen to this charlatan. My men have the entire Harbor Market locked down. We'll find Vivian tonight - no four-year wait required."

The old man simply stroked his beard.

"Young man, if you doubt my words, try your own fortune."

Nathaniel grabbed the bamboo tube, shaking it with theatrical flair. A stick tumbled out.

"The phoenix rises from ashes! Romance lies within reach!" Nathaniel read aloud, grinning.

The fortune-teller chuckled.

"A most auspicious draw. It predicts you'll meet your soulmate tonight."

The two men reacted polar opposites - Ethan's expression turned glacial while Nathaniel beamed.

"My soulmate? It has to be Vivian!"

Nathaniel's phone rang abruptly. His subordinate reported Vivian's location - the underground casino beneath Harbor Market - with complications.

"Ethan, she's at the casino and likely in trouble. Let's settle this fairly - first one to rescue her wins her heart. Agreed?"
###Chapter 352

Nathaniel Blackwood watched as Oliver Prescott dashed away in the same dramatic fashion as before.

"Such juvenile behavior!"

Rubbing his temples, Nathaniel exhaled sharply. Still, concern gnawed at him—what if something happened to Isabella? He pushed back his chair, ready to leave.

The elderly shopkeeper blocked his path.

"Young man, that is your friend's destiny. No need to interfere. Stay awhile. Browse my treasures. Perhaps one will lead you to your soulmate."

Oddly enough, Nathaniel believed him.

While others might dismiss the old man as a fraud, Nathaniel stayed. His gaze swept over the displayed items until a silk artifact caught his eye—or rather, the intricate embroidery on it.

"How much?"

"Fate brought us together. A single dor will suffice. Consider it payment for your bamboo drawing."

The shopkeeper carefully placed the silk in an ornate box and handed it to Nathaniel.

"You have excellent taste. This piece is fortunate to have found you."

"Thank you."

Nathaniel accepted it, though questions swirled in his mind. But Isabella's situation couldn't wait. He hurried toward the underground casino beneath Harbor Market.

That place was lawless.

A den of violence where only strength ruled.

Dark. Bloody. Brutal.

Countless lives had been lost there.

Why would Isabella go to such a hellhole? She was always courting danger.

The casino reeked of tobacco and desperation.

Anything could be bought or sold in that lawless pit.

Gamblers crowded around tables, eyes burning with greed.

Fortunes were made and lost in seconds.

Nathaniel's nose wrinkled at the stench as he entered.

His stomach churned when he spotted a still-beating heart on a nearby table.

A dealer in a tight leather outfit and bunny ears gestured at it.

"Fresh cow's heart! Eat it raw for stamina and longevity! Place your bets!"

The crowd erupted as a sweaty man won and bit into the dripping organ.

Nathaniel looked away, nauseated.

That could've been human.

Everywhere he turned, depravity unfolded.

This wasn't the human world—it was hell.

He'd heard rumors about Harbor Market's underground casino, but nothing prepared him for this.

His claustrophobia flared. Breathing grew difficult. His head pounded.

Gritting his teeth, he forced himself forward. Isabella was here somewhere. He had to find her.
###Chapter 353

Nathaniel Blackwood clenched his jaw, muttering under his breath. "Vivian... damn you, Vivian. You're going to regret this when I find you."

The casino stretched endlessly before him.

Every corner buzzed with activity, but one spot drew the largest crowd.

A packed circle of gamblers surrounded a round table, their shouts growing louder with each passing second.

Nathaniel's instincts flared. He moved swiftly toward the commotion.

There, bound atop the table, lay a trembling young woman.

Her barely-there white silk dress clung to her skin, the feathered mask obscuring half her face.

Curled into herself, she shivered violently in the corner.

Nathaniel's chest tightened. His fists curled at his sides, ready to strike.

Even with the mask, her features were unmistakable—the sharp nose, the soft pink lips, the delicate collarbones. A perfect replica of Vivian.

A towering man yanked the rope around her, grinning.

"Prime merchandise! Win her, and she's yours—use her, share her, whatever you like. Worth every penny. Who's next?"

He jerked the rope hard, forcing a pained whimper from the woman.

The sound ignited the crowd. Men shoved forward, throwing down bets without hesitation.

Nathaniel froze. His expression darkened as he watched, calculating.

Then, Oliver Prescott's voice cut through the noise.

"Three seconds. Hand her over, or this ends badly for you."

The rope-holder smirked. He dealt with threats like this daily.

"Want her? Place your bet. Win, and she's yours. Lose, and you walk away empty-handed."

Oliver wasn't in the mood for games.

"Three. Two—"

Casino security raised their weapons.

Oliver didn't flinch.

This place had power, but nothing compared to the Blackwood name.

Before the guards could react, Oliver's men had already sealed every exit.

Guns now pointed at Oliver, the rope-holder lunged.

"Stupid bastard!"

His fist flew toward Oliver's face—only to meet air.

Oliver dodged and delivered a brutal kick, sending the man crashing back.

The chain flew from his grip.

Vivian's double lurched forward, nearly toppling off the table—until Oliver caught her.

She weighed nothing.

Lighter than he remembered.

Oliver's pulse spiked. His grip stiffened, voice uncharacteristically nervous.

"Vivian... you okay? I've got you."

Nathaniel lingered at the crowd's edge, detached. Like this was someone else's problem.

Meanwhile, the humiliated man scrambled up, snarling.

"Open fire! Tear them apart!"
###Chapter 354

"Get back!"

Ethan's voice cut through the chaos from the sidelines.

This wasn't their territory to control.

Nathan's reckless actions were drawing too much attention, putting them all in jeopardy.

"So you brought backup!"

The man spotted Ethan and immediately barked orders to his security team.

"Take him down! Shoot on sight!"

"How dare you?"

Nathan, who had remained composed until now, snapped. He carefully set Vivian down before turning with icy fury.

"You can insult me, but threatening Ethan Blackwood? That's a death wish."

The man blinked in disbelief. He'd encountered bold men before, but none this suicidal.

Nathan was literally playing with fire.

What gave him the audacity? Without warning, Nathan delivered a brutal kick to the man's gut.

"On your knees! Apologize to Mr. Blackwood!"

Ethan sighed internally.

'An apology won't fix this mess.'

He kept the thought to himself. Though just an observer, Nathan had dragged him into the center of this storm. Bullets would fly because of his friend's temper.

Grateful wasn't the word.

Security guards now had weapons trained on both men, yet hesitated under their intimidating presence.

No one wanted to pull the trigger first.

"Release them and fetch your manager. I'll handle the consequences."

Ethan kept his hands in his pockets, staring down at the groaning man.

"Ethan, take Vivian and go. I specialize in situations like this," Nathan said.

Nearly ninety percent of Newport City's entertainment empire belonged to the Prescott family - most operating in legal gray zones.

This was Nathan's playground.

"Do I look dead to you?"

Nathan ground his heel into the man's skull, face twisted with rage.

"Shoot already, you cowards! Think this is funny?"

The guards finally stirred, fingers tightening on triggers.

Just as violence erupted, a new voice shouted.

"Stand down! All of you!"

The man started to protest until he saw who'd spoken. His face drained of color.

Simultaneously, every armed guard lowered their weapons in fear.

"V-Victor!"

Their manager had arrived.

Victor Holloway looked every inch the refined businessman in his forties. He pushed through the crowd directly toward Ethan and Nathan.

"Mr. Prescott, my deepest apologies. Had I known you were visiting with Mr. Blackwood... My men's ignorance is unforgivable..."

He punctuated this by kicking his subordinate repeatedly, then pressed a gun to the man's head.

"Worthless trash! Do you know this casino exists only because the Prescott family allowed it? You bite the hand that feeds you. I should execute you now!"

Nathan raised an eyebrow as the gun cocked.

"Enough. Ethan dislikes bloodshed. We're done here. But remember this lesson."
###Chapter 355

"Yes!"

Nathaniel Blackwood gave a firm nod.

The man cowering on the floor looked like he was about to wet himself.

"Thank you for sparing me... thank you," he stammered, voice trembling.

His fear wasn't unwarranted.

The Prescott family was untouchable.

They might play dirty in the shadows, but crossing the Prescotts meant signing their own death warrant.

Truthfully, Oliver Prescott had only dared to act so boldly because he'd sent word ahead to Victor Holloway.

"This place reeks of blood. I can't stand another second here."

Oliver wrinkled his nose in disgust.

Victor shrugged. "That's the nature of the business, Mr. Prescott. The messier it is, the more people flock here. This is where fortunes are made—and lost. Anything can be won here, things money can't buy anywhere else."

Victor wasn't the owner, just the face of the operation.

Under his management, the casino had grown into an infamous empire.

Oliver scoffed.

"Anything, huh? Including Isabella Lockhart? You've got some nerve."

Victor paled.

"Wait... you mean Isabella Lockhart of the Blackwood Group?"

"Exactly." Oliver cut him off sharply.

Victor's blood ran cold.

The Blackwoods led the Elite Eight of Newport City.

They were even more powerful than the Prescotts.

Whoever had taken Isabella and put her up as a prize had a death wish.

Victor kicked the man on the ground again.

"Are you insane? You kidnapped Mrs. Blackwood? Do you have a death wish? I told you—no one from the Elite Eight is to be touched! You've doomed us all!"

The man cowered, trying to defend himself.

"I-I didn't kidnap her! She came to us! She sold herself!"

All eyes turned to the woman in the white dress and feathered mask, her mouth still taped shut.

Oliver looked ready to kill him on the spot.

"Liar. Isabella Lockhart is worth millions. Why would she sell herself for pennies?"

The man sobbed.

"It's true! She asked for 150 grand. I transferred the money, and she said I could do whatever I wanted with her. Ask her yourself!"

Oliver hesitated.

Isabella owned a tech empire and a law firm. She'd gotten a fortune from Nathaniel.

There was no way she'd sell herself for pocket change.

He moved toward her, reaching for her mask—then stopped.

"Nathaniel, you should do it. You found her first. She's yours."

Despite his attraction to Isabella, Oliver knew better than to overstep.

To his surprise, Nathaniel just shrugged.

"Didn't the old man say this was your fate? It's got nothing to do with me. Hurry up. She's waiting for you to save her."
###Chapter 356

Ethan turned on his heel and walked away without sparing Vivian another glance.

"Wait, Ethan! You're leaving already?"

Nathan's laughter died in his throat as he realized his joke had crossed a line.

"Come on, man, it was just a joke. She's still yours. Even if I saved her, I wouldn't touch her. You know I wouldn't."

"Do whatever you want."

Ethan gave a dismissive wave before striding out of the tense room.

Nathan stood frozen, stunned by the cold dismissal.

Was Ethan seriously just handing his wife over like this?

He turned back to Vivian, still bound and helpless, looking like some forbidden prize wrapped in silk.

For the first time, Nathan felt a flicker of shame.

"Don't worry, Vivian. He's just jealous. Now that he's gone... I'll take care of you."

His voice was softer than usual, almost gentle. But the politeness only made the situation more awkward.

Her dress clung to her, sheer enough to leave little to the imagination.

Any man would struggle to keep his thoughts pure.

"Mmmph!"

The tape over her mouth muffled her protests as she shook her head violently, eyes wide with panic.

"Easy, I'll get you out of this."

Nathan worked at the thick ropes coiled around her body.

Each brush of her skin against his sent a jolt through him. The scent of her hair—light, floral—made his pulse quicken.

"Almost... there..."

He gritted his teeth, forcing himself to focus.

Damn.

This was harder than he'd expected.

Who knew the woman he'd once found so irritating could be this intoxicating?

Finally, the last knot gave way.

Nathan was sweating, but not from exertion.

Vivian stretched her limbs gingerly, the angry red marks from the ropes stark against her pale skin.

"I'll take off the mask too. You look... different like this. Softer. Not like the sharp-tongued woman I know."

His fingers brushed her cheek as he peeled the mask away.

Then—

Nathan recoiled like he'd been burned.

"Y-You're—"

His breath caught.

This wasn't Vivian.

The woman staring back at him had the same striking eyes—clear as a summer sky, with that same undercurrent of steel.

Her features were nearly identical.

A perfect doppelgänger.

No wonder he'd been fooled.

She ripped the tape from her mouth, tears welling in those familiar eyes.

"Thank you for saving me. If you hadn't come... I'd be at the mercy of monsters now. You gave me my life back. I'm yours now."

"What the hell?"

Nathan could only stare, his mind reeling.
###Chapter 357

Nathan Prescott swallowed hard. His mind reeled from the woman's shocking confession.

"I sold myself to the casino. They own me now—body and soul. I'd lost all hope because no matter which man claimed me, my fate would be the same. Then...God sent you to me."

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she instinctively moved closer to Nathan.

"Hold on—stay back!"

The six-foot-tall man recoiled as if she were venomous. He put deliberate distance between them, his expression wary.

The woman flinched at his rejection, freezing in place.

"Do I disgust you? Are you afraid I'll cling to you?"

"No! That's not—"

Nathan waved his hands frantically.

"I mean you're a human being, not some commodity. No one should control your life like this."

Her lips trembled. "But the contract's signed. If you refuse me, they'll take me back. I can't bear being auctioned off like livestock again while men fight over me."

"That's illegal."

Nathan's glare swung toward Victor Holloway. The casino manager paled, immediately thrusting a document at his subordinate.

"H-Here! We purchased her for 150k dors. She's yours now!"

With shaking hands, the lackey produced the signed contract bearing the woman's fingerprint. Nathan scanned it, pausing at the name.

"Cassandra Whitmore?"

Recognition flashed across his face.

"You're the dancer from Ethan's club that night. I knew you looked familiar."

"You finally remember." A fragile smile touched her lips. "Among all those men, you stood out."

Tears shimmered in Cassandra's eyes as she gazed at him.

That fateful night, two men had caught her attention—Ethan with his brooding intensity, and Nathan with his infectious charisma.

Initially, she'd been mesmerized by Ethan's dark magnetism. But later, she realized his type wasn't for her.

Nathan's warmth lingered in her memories.

And now, when he'd rescued her from hell, something inside her reignited. She'd been ready to die.

Now, she wanted to live—for him.

"Take me with you. I'll earn my keep—cooking, cleaning, whatever you need. I graduated from Stanford with—"

"Fine. You can come."

Nathan guided her out of the casino's suffocating gloom into crisp daylight. The contrast was jarring.

Checking his watch, he tore the contract to shreds.

"You're free. Go live your life."

Cassandra stared at the fluttering paper scraps.

"You're rejecting me. I understand. But I pay my debts. I'll return every cent of that 150k. Goodbye."

Nathan opened his mouth—then closed it. Some questions were better left unasked.

"Goodbye."

Their paths diverged.

Cassandra had taken three steps when her legs buckled. She crumpled to the pavement without a sound.
###Chapter 358

A shrill cry pierced the air.

"Someone's collapsed!"

Nathan Prescott had just slid into his car. He had no intention of involving himself with a woman who meant nothing to him. But the crowd thickened, and among them lurked men with dark intentions.

His jaw tightened. Against his better judgment, he strode forward.

"Move!"

His commanding voice cut through the chaos. The crowd parted instantly—his presence screamed wealth and power.

Except for one man.

A scarred brute sneered, hoisting the unconscious woman over his shoulder. "Back off. I found her first."

Nathan's eyes turned to ice. "Put. Her. Down."

The man scoffed. "Or what? She's fair game here."

Harbor Market had its own twisted rules. An unconscious woman was considered public property—first come, first served.

Nathan's hand shot out, gripping the man's wrist. "She's mine."

He yanked out the crumpled contract from his pocket. "Victor Holloway just handed this to me. Want to explain to him why you're stealing his property?"

The name hit like a hammer.

Victor wasn't a man you crossed.

The brute paled, shoving the woman into Nathan's arms. "Take her! Skinny thing anyway—not worth the trouble."

Nathan cradled her carefully. She was alarmingly light—barely ninety pounds, her frame drowning in worn clothes.

Her face, though…

It stopped him cold.

Delicate features, porcelain skin, lashes casting shadows on hollow cheeks. A near mirror of Vivian Lockhart—but softer, frailer.

A pained whimper escaped her lips.

Without thinking, he brushed his thumb between her furrowed brows.

Her eyes fluttered open.

Weak but aware, she smiled up at him—a ghost of warmth in her exhaustion.

Nathan stiffened. "There was a... bug. On your face."

Lame.

He'd charmed heiresses and socialites without breaking a sweat. Yet here he was, fumbling like a teenager.

Her whisper was barely audible. "I heard you... earlier."
###Chapter 359

Nathaniel's grip tightened around the steering wheel.

"Wait... What exactly did you hear?" he asked, voice strained.

Cassandra's lips curved into a fragile smile. "You said I belonged to you. Does that mean you've finally accepted me?"

His jaw clenched. "Don't misunderstand. It was just the heat of the moment. I had to—"

"Thank you."

Tears shimmered in her eyes despite her smile.

"Hearing those words... I have no regrets now. At least I won't be a lost soul when I'm gone."

Nathaniel's chest constricted. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.

"What the hell are you talking about? Gone where?"

She swayed, her fingers digging into his arm. "One last favor... please?"

The desperation in her voice made his resistance crumble.

"Name it."

"After I die... put my ashes in a small box. Bury me by the old well in the village. No ceremonies. Just... someone to light incense for me once a year."

Her breath came in shallow gasps.

Nathaniel's blood ran cold. "What aren't you telling me?"

"I'm fine, I just—"

A violent cough wracked her body. Blood sprayed across her trembling hands before she collapsed.

Nathaniel caught her just in time.

"Stay with me!" He lifted her into the car, heart hammering. "I'm getting you to a hospital. Don't you dare give up!"

Tires screeched as he tore through traffic.

This was the moment fate sealed them together—just as the old fortune teller's bamboo stick had foretold.

Cassandra was Nathaniel's destined trial. His curse to overcome.

Meanwhile, Julian returned to Blackwood Villa alone after scouring Harbor Market.

Midnight shadows stretched across the empty mansion. Still no trace of Isabella.

It was as if she'd vanished into thin air.

"Sir, we'll expand the search overseas," Dominic said. "I've contacted international agencies. It's only a matter of time—"

"Call it off."

Dominic blinked. "You're giving up?"

"Some gaps can't be bridged." Nathaniel's voice was hollow. "Even if I found her, we'd only destroy each other. Maybe... we were never meant to be."

The old man's words echoed in his mind—four years of separation. Four years to unravel the truth.

Time would either heal them or prove their love was never real.

Upstairs, Nathaniel spread the silk artifact from the market beside the charred fragment salvaged from Lockhart Manor.

The patterns aligned perfectly—a phoenix and spider lily forming an intricate map.

His breath hitched.

"These markings..."

Fingers tracing the delicate lines, he suddenly froze.

A revelation struck like lightning.

"This isn't just a map. It's—"
###Chapter 360

Ethan Blackwood's fingers trembled as he studied the map.

The terrain matched perfectly with the entrance to the Blackwood family's ancestral tomb on Pinecrest Peak in Nordhaven.

The Blackwoods traced their lineage back to the Thame Dynasty.

Generals. Ministers. Power brokers. Their name carried weight through centuries.

Nordhaven had always been their stronghold. Their ancestors rested in Pinecrest Peak's sacred grounds—protected, secluded, blessed with the finest Fengshui.

Only during his great-grandfather's era had the family migrated south, establishing their empire in Harborview City.

Now, they rarely returned to Nordhaven except for solemn rituals.

"Why is the map to our ancestral tomb sewn into Vivian's bedsheet?" Ethan muttered.

Was there some ancient connection between the Blackwoods and the Lockharts? He'd have to ask his grandfather when the time was right.

Carefully, he stored both the sheet and the silk artifact in a lacquered box.

Then he grabbed Vivian's notebook and dialed Nathan Prescott.

——

Nathan sat on a cold hospital bench, eyes fixed on the ER doors.

He'd lost his damn mind.

Since when did he play Good Samaritan? He was the guy who stepped over trouble, not carried it to the emergency room. Yet here he was, skipping dinner for a stranger.

His phone buzzed. "Ethan. Talk."

Even as he answered, his attention stayed on the blinking ER light.

Each pulse meant they were still working on Cassandra Whitmore.

He barely knew her. So why did his chest tighten at the thought of that bright spirit snuffed out too soon?

"You saw the notebook in my car earlier," Ethan said. "Remember your promise?"

Nathan groaned. "Do I get a choice?"

This reeked of one of Ethan's traps. Like handing a shovel to a man and saying, You wanted to dig your own grave? Here, I'll hold your coat.

"Relax. It's mutually beneficial," Ethan said smoothly.

"Bullshit. If it's so profitable, do it yourself."

Nathan knew better. He, Ethan, and Dominic had been inseparable since childhood.

When Ethan called, trouble followed.

The smart move? Decline immediately.

"Since when does the Prescott heir turn down easy money?" Ethan's tone turned dangerous.

"Maybe it's time the Prescott Group faced some... financial turbulence."

"Jesus, just spit it out." Nathan surrendered.

If Nathan was a predator, Ethan was the apex hunter who'd always outmaneuvered him. Resistance was futile.

"What did you think of the novel's content?" Ethan asked abruptly.

"Genius. Best thing I've ever read." Nathan slapped his knee for emphasis.

Maybe he meant it. Maybe he just wanted to piss Ethan off.

"The male lead," Ethan said through gritted teeth, "is a walking disaster. A monster. The king of all scumbags."

Nathan smirked.

Ethan's frown deepened. Was Nathan mocking him? Hard to tell—because honestly, the protagonist was a dumpster fire of a human being.
###Chapter 361

"I want this novel adapted into a movie within three months."

Nathaniel Blackwood's voice was sharp, leaving no room for negotiation.

"Money isn't an issue. Spare no expense. I want it to be the biggest blockbuster in the world."

The Blackwood family owned Universal Entertainment, a powerhouse in the global film industry.

Their roster included A-list celebrities, and their productions dominated box offices worldwide.

Nathaniel trusted Oliver Prescott with this task.

"You didn’t even need to ask. I had the same thought after reading it." Oliver's eyes gleamed with excitement.

"The real-life adaptation, the depth of the characters, the intense conflicts—it’s perfect for the screen. But..." He hesitated.

"The plot is a bit predictable. It might work better as a high-budget drama series. Turning it into an award-winning film? That won’t be easy."

"If it were easy, I wouldn’t have come to you." Nathaniel’s tone was final.

"I want this film to premiere globally in three months. Make it happen."

Oliver wanted to scream.

"Nathaniel, you can’t just snap your fingers and expect miracles. The story isn’t even finished yet. Casting? Rights? Have you considered any of that?"

"I don’t care." Nathaniel’s voice was ice.

"Three months. Or you’ll regret it."

"Nathaniel, be reasonable—"

Click.

The line went dead.

Oliver stood frozen, resisting the urge to tear his hair out.

Making a movie was one thing.

Making a global phenomenon in three months? Impossible.

Just then, the emergency light above the operating room flickered off.

The doctor stepped out, wiping his brow.

"She’s stable."

Oliver rushed forward. "How is she?"

"Lucky doesn’t even begin to cover it. Half a bottle of ToxiClean should have killed her instantly. But she fought like hell to survive."

The doctor exhaled heavily.

"Most suicide cases don’t have that kind of willpower. Hers was the strongest I’ve ever seen. She wanted to live."

Oliver’s stomach twisted.

"So she really drank half a bottle?"

Cassandra Whitmore hadn’t just sold herself to Victor Holloway’s men out of desperation.

She had done it knowing she wouldn’t survive.

She had traded her body, her dignity—for what? A measly 150 grand?

What kind of hell had she been through to resort to that?

Oliver’s curiosity burned.

And that was dangerous.

"ToxiClean is lethal in drops, let alone half a bottle. We pumped her stomach, but the damage is done." The doctor shook his head.

"Whoever she is, she’s got a spine of steel."

Oliver nodded absently.

"Diet restrictions?"

"No spicy food. No alcohol. And definitely no stress."

"Understood."

The doctor left, and Oliver approached Cassandra’s room.

His hand hovered over the doorknob.

Then he stopped.

This wasn’t his problem. He’d done enough.

Any more, and he’d be playing with fire.

Walk away, Oliver.

Before it’s too late.
###Chapter 362

Three months later, on a private island in Southeast Paris.

Vivian Lockhart lounged on a white hammock, savoring a slice of chilled watermelon while scrolling through short videos on her phone.

Her due date was two months away, and her belly had grown noticeably rounder.

Since leaving Newport City, she had settled on this secluded paradise. Every day, she strolled in the ocean breeze, indulged in gourmet meals, sipped tropical drinks, and lost herself in novels. She also managed Lockhart Enterprises and her law firm remotely.

Life was blissfully peaceful.

As she often joked—getting involved with men only brought trouble. Ever since she cut ties with Ethan Blackwood for good, her days had been nothing but joy. No alarms, no obligations. She slept in, ate well, and even put on a few happy pounds.

This island had been her secret dream for years. She purchased it with scholarship money, patent earnings, and childhood savings. Every detail was designed to her exact vision—a holiday retreat where she could bring her family.

Fate, however, had other plans.

Shortly after its completion, her family fell apart. Then came her marriage into the Blackwood dynasty, trapping her in a gilded cage.

For years, Liam Osborne had quietly maintained the island. Not only was it preserved, but its amenities had only grown more luxurious. It even had its own satellite station, ensuring secure, untraceable communication.

No exaggeration—this was a self-sufficient paradise.

Vivian could live here forever, hidden from the world.

She named it Coral Haven.

Sunflowers bloomed across the land, a symbol of her wish—that her children, like those golden blooms, would always seek the light, stand strong, and embrace life’s brightness.

Her nanny, Evelyn Whitmore, stayed with her. A master of ancestral medicine, Evelyn dedicated herself to Vivian’s prenatal care, crafting nutrient-rich meals daily.

Both women eagerly awaited the baby’s arrival, a new heartbeat for the island.

Bzzzz…

The hum of a speedboat engine echoed from the pier.

Evelyn glanced toward the dock, then turned to Vivian with a grin.

"Vivian! Look who’s here!"

Still absorbed in her phone, Vivian didn’t bother lifting her head.

"Who else would it be? Liam, the man allergic to a nine-to-five?"

"Not just him—Sophia’s here too!"

"What? Sophia?"

Vivian’s eyes lit up. She grabbed the hammock’s support rope and carefully stood, ready to greet them.

Sophia Osborne was already sprinting toward her in a breezy tank top and cutoff shorts.

"Viv! I’ve missed you so much!"

She threw her arms around Vivian in a tight embrace.

Liam, trailing behind, frowned in alarm.

"Sophia, I told you to be gentle! She’s seven months pregnant—one wrong move and you’ll regret it!"

He wedged himself between them, forcibly separating the pair.

Dressed in a crisp white shirt and casual shorts, Liam looked like he’d stepped off a magazine cover—sunglasses, tousled hair, effortless charm.

Countless women would swoon over him.

But right now, he was in full overprotective mode, radiating the energy of a very handsome, very naggy guardian.
###Chapter 363

"Enough already! You've been mother-henning me nonstop for nine hours straight. Anyone would think you're the one about to pop!"

Sophia rolled her eyes at Liam before pulling Vivian into another careful embrace.

Her hands lingered over Vivian's swollen belly, eyes widening in awe.

"Viv, you're huge! I still can't believe there are two little humans in there."

Vivian smiled, realizing Liam must have spilled everything. No point in secrets now.

"Twins. Due in eight weeks."

Life had taken on a surreal quality since coming to Bali. Time moved differently here—slower, sweeter. She'd spend hours talking to her babies, singing lullabies, feeling their tiny kicks in response.

"Twins?!" Sophia shrieked.

"Damn, girl! Last I checked, you and that bastard Nathaniel barely touched. Unless..." She waggled her eyebrows. "You two were going at it like rabbits?"

Vivian pressed a hand to her forehead. Leave it to Sophia to make things awkward.

"But the Blackwoods don't have twin genes..." Sophia's face lit up. "Wait—could they be Liam's? Our family has twins! Oh my God, I'm gonna be an aunt!"

Vivian's laughter caught in her throat. If only.

Liam visited every few days—bringing Azure Group updates, ridiculous gifts, and terrible jokes that never failed to make her smile. He'd risked his life for her, always put her first.

Why couldn't she love him?

Some attractions defied logic. Like her disastrous obsession with Nathaniel. Or his inexplicable need to destroy her.

"Remember your promise? No interrogations!" Liam flicked Sophia's forehead. "I only brought you because you cried for days thinking Viv was dead."

He sighed. His twin was incorrigible.

"Father doesn't matter. These babies belong to Vivian—that's all you need to know."

"Fine." Sophia squeezed Vivian's hands. "They're yours, so I'll love them unconditionally."

Their chatter flowed until Sophia gasped, scrambling for her phone.

"Viv! You'll never guess what just happened!"
###Chapter 364

"What's this?"

Vivian's curiosity was instantly piqued. She leaned in closer.

Sophia pulled up a video—a recording from what appeared to be a movie premiere.

A group of actors stood in front of a massive screen, introducing their film.

"This is..."

Vivian's jaw dropped when she recognized one of them. It felt like she was staring at an alien.

"Ha! Didn’t see that coming, did you?" Sophia grinned. "This is the premiere of Chasing My Lockhart—the movie adaptation of your story with Nathaniel. I watched it. It’s incredible! I cried so much!"

She clutched her chest dramatically, already itching to rewatch it.

"I get why they made the movie, but can someone explain why the male lead… is Nathaniel?!"

Vivian rubbed her eyes, convinced she was hallucinating.

Since when did Nathaniel Blackwood, a ruthless business tycoon who made millions in minutes, star in a romance film?

Was he that bored? Or had the producers blackmailed him into it?

"Exactly!" Sophia nodded eagerly. "The whole project was kept under wraps until the last minute. When the cast was revealed, the entire entertainment industry, business world, and even social media exploded. Rumor has it Nathaniel took the role because he wrote the script—under a pen name, as a tribute to you."

"That’s bullshit!"

Vivian shot to her feet, furious.

"Who started that lie? Is he that shameless? Plagiarizing someone else’s work? Use your brain—how could an emotionless robot like him write something so heartfelt?"

"Vivian, calm down," Sophia urged, pulling her back onto the couch. "Think of the babies."

"I know he didn’t write it," Sophia admitted. "But the original author hasn’t spoken up. That’s why people believe it’s him. Plus, the web novel never got an ending, but the movie wraps everything up perfectly. The second half is even more emotional than the first. You’ll understand when you watch it!"

Vivian clenched her fists.

She couldn’t admit the truth—that she was the author. The first half of the novel was embarrassingly romantic, painting her as a naive, lovestruck girl. She’d never claim it.

"It’s just PR," Liam cut in, arms crossed. "After the divorce, Nathaniel and Blackwood Group took a hit. Now, this movie makes him look like some devoted romantic hero. Pathetic."

"Exactly!" Sophia agreed. "The timing is too convenient. The premiere hasn’t even gone public yet, but it’s already boosting Blackwood Group’s stocks. Nathaniel’s gained a legion of female fans overnight."

Vivian’s eyes narrowed.

That explained the sudden stock surge. Blackwood Group hadn’t launched any new projects recently. This was their play all along.

"I also heard Nathaniel took the role to pursue the female lead," Vivian muttered. "But she’s already involved with the film’s producer—Oliver Prescott from Universal Entertainment."
###Chapter 365

Sophia had always been drawn to juicy gossip, which gave her insider knowledge from multiple sources. She tapped the actress's image on the screen with her manicured nail.

"Don't you think she resembles you? There's something eerily familiar about her." Vivian's brows knitted slightly.

"I can't shake this feeling I've seen her before."

"You've got the memory of a goldfish." Sophia rolled her eyes dramatically. "This is the woman Nathaniel left the club with that night. The carbon copy of you!"

"Oh."

Recognition flashed across Vivian's face, followed by a bitter taste in her mouth. She'd assumed Nathaniel would remain drowning in remorse, never moving on.

Yet here he was, already with someone new.

Typical man.

Heartless to the core. "What's his game? Why pour so much money into chasing this lookalike?" Sophia studied Vivian's reaction while glancing at Cassandra's photo.

The resemblance was uncanny.

"Maybe he's still hung up on you? Found himself a replacement to fill the void?" Sophia ventured.

"Stop inventing fantasies." Vivian's gaze remained steady, her voice ice-cold.

"His feelings for me died long ago. Only hatred remains. I destroyed his child. Because of me, the woman he loved lost everything. He's merciful just letting me breathe..."

"Does he know about the twins? If he found out, maybe—"

"Enough!" Vivian cut her off sharply.

"If you're truly my friend, never mention him again. These children are mine alone. They belong to no one else. Push this nonsense again, and you'll regret it."

"My bad, Viv." Sophia raised her hands in surrender. "I wasn't thinking. I get it. No more talk about that bastard. Cross my heart."

She made an exaggerated vow gesture.

Though Sophia had watched Chasing My Lockhart, the storyline still unsettled her.

In this day and age, keeping the kids and ditching the man might be the ultimate power move.

As Vivian's ride-or-die, she'd back her play no matter what. Vivian turned toward Liam without another word.

"Study. Now. We need to talk privately."

They retreated to the beachfront study at Skyview Retreat.

Liam produced a flash drive, delivering a thorough update on Lockhart Enterprises' recent developments.

The bombshell? Plans for an in-house research facility were advancing rapidly.

Liam had opposed this from day one.

Even now, he couldn't resist one final attempt before contracts were signed.

"This venture is high-risk. The capital outlay alone is staggering. Worst of all? We lack the research talent. This could bankrupt us and leave us drowning in debt. We'll be laughingstocks!"

He leaned forward intently. "Downstream firms like ours focus on production and distribution. Research centers? Unnecessary. Take Blackwood Group—no in-house facility, just strategic partnerships. Yet they dominate through sheer manufacturing and sales prowess."

"Is that so?"

Vivian rested her chin on interlaced fingers, eyes gleaming with determination.

"Execute my orders. Leadership status is inevitable—it's just a matter of timing."
###Chapter 366

The night had deepened by the time Vivian bid farewell to Sophia and Liam.

Waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, restoring the beach house to its usual tranquil state. The sweet scent of night-blooming jasmine lingered in the air.

Vivian's fingers brushed absently over various objects—a vase, a book, the edge of the coffee table—as if searching for distraction. She even devoted thirty minutes to pampering Marmalade with fresh catnip, using the playful interaction to avoid confronting her restless thoughts.

Yet her eyes kept drifting toward the sleek laptop on the desk. Her fingers twitched with suppressed curiosity.

Finally, she surrendered. The laptop screen flickered to life beneath her touch.

With practiced keystrokes, she bypassed security protocols and accessed the film distributor's database. Moments later, she'd downloaded "Chasing My Lockhart," Ethan Blackwood's highly anticipated directorial debut.

She had to see for herself whether the rave reviews were justified.

The film ran for two hours. Vivian dimmed the lights in her private screening room, prepared popcorn and sparkling water, then settled into the plush sofa.

From the opening scene, the craftsmanship was undeniable. Every frame held purpose, every detail meticulously curated.

Then came the rain-soaked meeting between the leads—a scene that mirrored Vivian's own memories with painful accuracy.

Her throat tightened. This wasn't just a movie; it was a reflection of her past with Ethan, condensed into 120 minutes of bittersweet nostalgia.

The second half took creative liberties, depicting an idyllic domestic life that never was—raising children together, sharing quiet mornings. Until one fateful argument shattered the illusion.

The male lead's subsequent journey across continents, sending postcards from every stop, filled an entire suitcase with unsent letters. The film's ambiguous ending—"You're back," whispered in a dream—left Vivian clutching a wad of tissues.

"Damn you, Ethan," she muttered, wiping her cheeks. The man had turned their history into award-worthy cinema while casting himself as the tragic romantic hero.

The screening room lights brightened abruptly.

Evelyn Whitmore appeared in the doorway, concern etching her features. "Miss Lockhart? What's wrong?"

"Nothing, I just—"

Vivian couldn't admit she'd been emotionally wrecked by her ex-husband's cinematic masterpiece.

"Did Marmalade bother you?" Evelyn scolded the orange tabby now curled on Vivian's lap. "I've told you, Miss Lockhart is carrying twins! No jumping on her stomach!"

Marmalade flicked his tail indignantly and leapt down, settling before the still-glowing screen as if contemplating the film's artistic merits himself.
###Chapter 367

Vivian's eyes widened in shock when she recognized the male lead in the movie was none other than Nathaniel Blackwood.

"Seriously? That arrogant bastard is acting now?" She scoffed, crossing her arms. "Is the Blackwood Group going under? Since when does a CEO moonlight as an actor?"

Evelyn chuckled mischievously. "Rumor has it he's trying to impress the leading lady."

"Typical!" Vivian spat, her disgust evident. After learning how Nathaniel had nearly killed her for Cassandra's sake, her contempt for him had reached new heights.

The thought of him chasing another woman made her blood boil. "You made the right choice leaving him, Miss Lockhart. At least your children won't grow up witnessing their father's infidelity."

Vivian offered a faint smile but remained silent. Under different circumstances, she would have joined Evelyn in condemning Nathaniel.

But having seen the film changed everything. The man who wrote such a poignant, heartfelt ending couldn't be entirely heartless. His attention to detail revealed depths she hadn't expected.

"For your babies' sake, I'll refrain from criticizing him further," Evelyn conceded, taking measured breaths to calm herself.

She proceeded with Vivian's routine checkup, monitoring her pulse and blood sugar levels. "Everything looks perfect. Your little ones are thriving."

"When Mr. Osborne heard you wanted a water birth, he secretly commissioned designers to create a specialized birthing suite weeks ago." Evelyn's eyes sparkled with excitement. "It's an underwater chamber with glass walls extending into the ocean depths. You'll be able to watch marine life swim by during labor - very therapeutic."

"An underwater birthing room?" Vivian's voice trembled with disbelief. She'd mentioned the idea casually, never imagining Liam would remember, let alone make it happen.

"Of course he remembered," Evelyn said warmly. "Mr. Osborne pays attention to every detail where you're concerned. In my opinion, he surpasses Nathaniel in countless ways. Have you considered making him the father your children deserve?"

Previously, Vivian would have dismissed the suggestion immediately. Now, she rested her hands on her swelling belly, feeling her babies' lively movements. "I'll... think about it."

Evelyn beamed. "Mr. Osborne would be overjoyed to hear that! You're finally seeing reason, Miss Lockhart. A man who loves you will never break your heart like one you love but doesn't love you back."

Vivian shook her head. "Love isn't the only foundation for a relationship. Liam is my most trusted friend. That bond means more to me than romance. Besides, I need stability now."

Meanwhile, in Newport City...

Nathan Prescott sat across from cinema executives, finalizing distribution plans for 'Hunt My Everheart' when his phone buzzed urgently.

The film distributor reported a security breach - someone had copied the original movie files. Nathan's lips curved into a triumphant smile as he immediately dialed Nathaniel. "Just as you predicted. The bait's been taken."
###Chapter 368

Ethan Blackwood knew the moment "Chase My Lockhart" started trending on Twitter, it would draw attention.

Vivian Lockhart's curiosity was inevitable.

But he hadn't anticipated her reaction would be this swift.

The film hadn't even premiered yet, yet here she was, unable to resist.

So much for her grand exit—clearly, she wasn't as detached as she pretended.

Nathan Prescott strode into the CEO's office with a smug grin, slipping a folded note into Ethan's palm.

"Don't lose this," Nathan warned. "I've done all I can. If you still can't bring her back, that's on you. Don't come crying to me later."

Ethan barely glanced up from his paperwork, fingers tightening around the note. "What is this?"

"Your wife's location."

Nathan's excitement was palpable. "Remember that hacker who leaked the film? I tracked them down. They're operating from a private island. And guess who's there right now?"

His grin widened. "Your runaway bride."

Ethan's expression flickered—just for a second—before settling back into icy indifference. "Where she goes is none of my concern. Take it back. I don't need it."

Nathan blinked. "Are you serious? You had me monitoring her every move. You funded this damn movie just to lure her out. And now you're acting like you don't care?"

"I only wanted proof she wasn't as unaffected as she claimed." Ethan flipped a page, voice flat. "Now that I have it, her whereabouts mean nothing to me."

Nathan stared, dumbfounded.

This wasn't the reaction he'd expected.

He'd imagined Ethan would bolt the second he had Vivian's location. Instead, the man was acting like she was a stranger.

"You're lying to yourself," Nathan snapped. "Three months apart, and you're still playing this game? If you love her, go get her. At least try."

Ethan finally looked up, eyes glacial. "Since you're so invested, why don't you go yourself? The whole world knows we're over. If you want her, have her."

Nathan's jaw clenched.

He'd had feelings for Vivian once—fleeting, meaningless. But that was before he'd met someone else. Before he'd realized some lines shouldn't be crossed.

"Fine." Nathan snatched the note back, tearing it to shreds before tossing it into the trash. "Your loss. Don't come whining to me when you regret this."

He stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

The office plunged into silence.

Outside, the city lights glittered against the night sky.

Ethan didn't move.

His fingers tightened around his pen.

Then—

Snap.

The pen broke in half.
###Chapter 369

Only a handful of employees lingered in the Blackwood Group headquarters at this late hour.

Nathaniel Blackwood sat hunched over his desk, fingers combing through stacks of financial reports.

The company had grown exponentially under his leadership, but success came with its own set of challenges.

The tech sector proved particularly brutal. Their strategic alliance with QuantumTech had created an industry powerhouse, controlling nearly 80% of the market share.

This dominance made Nathaniel a target. Competitors launched smear campaigns and underhanded tactics daily.

The latest crisis involved their new smartwatch line. Whistleblowers claimed the devices secretly recorded private conversations, sparking lawsuits and media frenzy.

"Get PR working on damage control immediately." Nathaniel's voice cut through the tense silence.

"Track down the source of these rumors. I want defamation lawsuits filed by morning."

"Recall all smartwatches from retailers. Have R&D run forensic tests for any surveillance capabilities."

After hours of crisis calls and document signings, Nathaniel finally pushed back from his desk. His fingers dove into the wastebasket, retrieving torn paper fragments.

The shreds were tiny, nearly impossible to reconstruct. His temples throbbed as he painstakingly arranged the pieces. "Damn you, Oliver! Was shredding necessary?"

Just as the puzzle neared completion, his secretary knocked.

"Sir?"

Nathaniel's body jerked, sending paper scraps flying across the floor like confetti.

The secretary froze mid-step. "Are you unwell, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Don't move!" His command sliced through the office. "Watch your feet."

She became a statue. "Shall I call maintenance to clean this, sir?"

"No." Nathaniel smoothed his tie, regaining composure. "What is it?"

"Mr. Prescott called. He's sent coordinates via WhatsApp and specifically requested..." She hesitated, eyes darting to the trash bin. "He said not to retrieve anything from the receptacle. Hygiene concerns."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Duly noted."

Only when the door clicked shut did he check his phone. The location pin made his lips curl into a predatory smile.

"Running won't save you this time, Vivian."
###Chapter 370

That same night, Ethan boarded his private jet and flew straight to Bali at full speed.

The entire flight, he kept telling himself to remain composed and indifferent when he saw Vivian.

This wasn't about missing her or wanting to rekindle their relationship. He was only going because he needed her legal expertise to handle the lawsuits Blackwood Group was facing.

Yes, that’s the only reason.

After convincing himself, he finally relaxed.

By the time he arrived, it was already morning.

The sun blazed gold and crimson over the horizon, painting the ocean in fiery hues.

Ethan stepped onto a speedboat and cut through the waves toward the shore.

As soon as he arrived, a local girl approached him with a bright smile.

"Uncle, are you here for Aunt Vivian?" she asked, her sun-kissed cheeks dimpling.

Hmph. At least she sent someone to greet me.

"Yes," he answered coolly.

"Follow me! I'll take you to her!"

The girl turned and sprinted ahead before he could respond.

Ethan followed, assuming it wouldn’t be far.

He was wrong.

They started at the base of the mountain and climbed relentlessly for over two hours.

Ethan was fit, but even he was panting. "How much longer?" he demanded.

"Aunt Vivian’s house is far, but it’s beautiful! You’ll love it!"

He gritted his teeth. "Let’s rest first."

"Uncle, you’re tired already?" The girl giggled. "Aunt Vivian was right—you are weak."

Ethan stiffened.

Vivian, you little—

They trekked another three hours before reaching the summit.

A quaint orange chapel stood at the edge, overlooking the endless sea.

"Aunt Vivian prays here every morning," the girl said. "Go inside."

Exhausted, Ethan barely managed a thumbs-up.

"Uncle, you’re so handsome!" She blinked up at him. "Can I have a hug?"

His irritation melted instantly.

"Of course."

He scooped her up, and she giggled before scampering back down the mountain.

Ethan wiped his brow, straightened his clothes, and schooled his expression into icy indifference.

Then he stepped inside.

What would she look like after three months?

Thinner? Tanned? Miserable? Bald?

Women were emotional creatures. He imagined her crying every night, unable to move on.

But he had thrived.

Gym sessions. Healthy meals. A sharper wardrobe.

He was confident he’d leave her breathless.
###Chapter 371

The church door stood firmly closed. Nathaniel Blackwood contemplated barging in but stopped himself. That would be undignified.

Instead, he waited outside, clearing his throat sharply. "Come out. Now."

Silence.

Masking his irritation with icy composure, he added, "My patience isn't infinite. You'll regret making me come in there."

The thought infuriated him—flying across continents, hiking for hours up this damned mountain, only to be ignored. If she wouldn't respond, he'd have to drag her out himself.

He whirled around and slammed the door open. "Vivian, this is your last—"

"Surprise!" A mocking voice echoed through the empty chapel. "Fooled you, Nathaniel."

No Vivian. Just a lone teddy bear sitting on a pew, its beady eyes glinting.

The stuffed animal crackled to life, its pre-recorded laughter grating. "Hah! Mr. Blackwood, you actually fell for it. Pathetic."

"Save your energy. You'll never find me unless I want to be found."

"And when I do show up? Better be ready."

Every word was a needle to his pride. His jaw tightened.

"Vivian."

He, Nathaniel Blackwood—outsmarted by a woman.

His fingers twitched toward the bear, ready to shred it.

"Try it," the toy taunted, "and you'll never leave this island. Check your wallet."

His hand flew to his pocket. Empty.

That little thief. She'd pickpocketed him during the chaos earlier.

Chasing her now was pointless. She'd be long gone.

"Damn you! What's your game?" Rage simmered beneath his skin.

The bear's voice turned smug. "See? Nothing's what it seems."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. Fury gave way to grudging irritation.

Exhausted. Penniless. Not even water money. Was this how he'd die—outplayed by his own wife?

Never in his life had he been this reckless. This... humiliated.

All Vivian's doing.

"Here's your task," the bear continued. "Hold me and repeat 100 times: 'Vivian Lockhart is a saint. I'm a blind fool.' Do it, and your wallet magically reappears."

"Vivian, you can't be serio—"

Beep.

Dead air.

She'd cut the feed remotely, no doubt grinning somewhere.

Nathaniel glared at the bear. No chance he'd utter those words.

Meanwhile, Vivian lounged on a sunbed, licking a mango popsicle. Her tablet showed live footage: Nathaniel, sweat-drenched, muttering to bewildered tourists, "Vivian Lockhart is a saint. I'm a blind fool."

She smirked. "Thought your little hacker could track me? Sweet of you to try."
###Chapter 372

Newport City Airport, four years later.

A striking woman in oversized sunglasses stood out effortlessly in the bustling crowd. Her curve-hugging black dress accentuated every inch of her flawless figure.

With delicate features and legs that seemed to go on forever, she moved with effortless grace, her stilettos clicking rhythmically against the polished floor. Heads turned as she passed.

Sophia Osborne lounged against her crimson Ferrari outside the terminal, lazily scanning the exit. The moment she spotted Vivian Lockhart, she sprang to life, waving wildly. "Viv! Over here!"

Vivian arched a perfectly sculpted brow, sauntering over with deliberate slowness. She slid her sunglasses down just enough to reveal amused hazel eyes. "Soph, dial it down before airport security thinks you're some deranged stalker."

"Like I care!"

Sophia launched herself at Vivian, squeezing tight. "Four damn years, Viv. You're finally back. I missed you so much it hurts!"

Vivian chuckled, patting her friend's back. "Dramatic much? We literally FaceTimed last night."

"Screen time doesn't count!" Sophia pulled back, hands already roaming. "Let me check—oh my god, these curves! How are you even real? No way you pushed out two babies with this body. Spill—did you hire a surrogate or something?"

Vivian froze mid-laugh. "Get in the car before someone recognizes me. I'm not ready for that circus yet."

"Roger that!"

Sophia popped the door open with a flourish.

As she slid into the passenger seat, she shot Vivian a mischievous look. "Remember when you used to race professionally? This baby's fresh off the lot. Wanna show me what she can do?"

A spark ignited in Vivian's eyes as she gripped the wheel. "Buckle up."

Years of motherhood and business deals had dulled the thrill. But the moment her Louboutin pressed the accelerator, adrenaline surged through her veins like old times.

The Ferrari roared to life, tires screeching as they shot forward.

Sophia white-knuckled the door handle, laughing wildly. "Holy shit, I forgot how terrifying you are behind the wheel!"

Vivian's lips curved as they merged onto the freeway, leaving a trail of stunned drivers in their wake.

The wind whipped through their hair as the speedometer climbed.

"Faster!" Sophia whooped.

Vivian obliged. The world blurred into streaks of color.

For the first time in years, she felt truly alive.
###Chapter 373

Sophia jumped to her feet, her excited shriek cutting through the rushing wind.

"Hold on tight!" Vivian warned with a gentle laugh, gripping the steering wheel.

Her heart swelled with joy.

Though Coral Haven had been peaceful, Harborview City was home.

This was where her roots ran deep—where generations of Lockharts had lived and loved.

Her people were here. The memories, both sweet and painful, that shaped her. This city still claimed her soul.

She'd vowed to return only when strong enough to protect what mattered most.

As the car slowed, Sophia settled back into her seat, studying Vivian with sudden curiosity.

"Viv, tell me the truth," she pressed. "Why this secret homecoming? Why hasn't Nathaniel heard you're back?"

Only Sophia knew about Vivian's return. She'd sworn her to secrecy—not even Liam could know.

"No grand scheme," Vivian murmured, one hand on the wheel, the other propping up her chin. "I missed home. And the Lockhart estate needs restoring before Adrian and Abigail arrive."

Sophia's eyes lit up. "You're bringing them here permanently?"

Vivian didn't deny it. "If all goes well," she said with a meaningful lift of her brows.

"It will!"

"God, I've missed this place. We'll paint the town red like old times. You can't imagine how lonely it's been without you—no one measures up to my ride-or-die."

Vivian's chest tightened. She reached over to squeeze Sophia's hand like she often did with Abigail. "I know these years haven't been easy. But soon you'll never be alone again. We'll be unstoppable."

"How soon? You're not lying to me again, are you?"

For four endless years, Sophia had prayed for this moment.

Every phone call ended with Vivian's infuriating refrain: Not yet. The timing isn't right.

"Four years of excuses!" Sophia accused. "I watched your babies grow from babbling infants to sassy little debaters through a screen. How could you do that to me?"

Vivian chuckled. "Guilty as charged."

Then her expression sobered. "This time, I mean it."

"Fine. One last chance." Sophia folded her arms with mock indignation.

"But listen—if you bring them here, you'll need to be careful." Sophia's voice dropped. "Your ex isn't to be trusted. After failing to have kids with Cassandra all these years? He'd snatch yours in a heartbeat—especially Adrian. That boy is his mirror image."
###Chapter 374

"Steal my children?"

Vivian's frosty gaze burned with fury as her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Let's see if he dares."

"I believe in you, Viv. Lockhart Enterprises has flourished under your leadership. But this time... your opponent is Nathaniel Blackwood himself. People fear him for a reason—his tactics are ruthless. Going head-to-head with him won't be easy."

Sophia shook her head, worry creasing her brow.

Nathaniel wasn't just any adversary, and the Blackwoods were a force to be reckoned with.

Though Vivian was formidable, she stood alone. Even with the Osbornes' support, the odds were stacked against her.

"Why not stay here permanently? Adrian is adorable—I'd be heartbroken if Nathaniel took him away!"

"Never."

Vivian radiated unshakable confidence. "Did you think I spent all those years on Bali just lounging around?" A knowing smirk played on her lips. "If Nathaniel tries to take my children from me, he'll have to go through me first."

Her expression darkened as she slammed her foot on the accelerator. The sleek Ferrari surged forward, its engine roaring on the open highway.

But mid-speed, the car abruptly decelerated, rolling to a stop on the shoulder.

"What the hell? This car is brand new!" Sophia groaned, staring at the dashboard in dismay.

Clueless about mechanics, she could only glare at the unresponsive vehicle.

"Engine trouble. Stay put—I'll check it out."

Vivian remained calm. After reassuring Sophia, she stepped out without hesitation.

She popped the hood, propped it open, and leaned in to inspect the engine. Her raven-black hair cascaded freely, her toned figure accentuated by the sunlight. The sight of a stunning woman tinkering with a luxury car drew stares from passing drivers.

Distracted, several cars nearly rear-ended each other.

"Need help, gorgeous?"

A potbellied man in a slick suit emerged from a BMW, leering as he approached.

Vivian ignored him, focused on diagnosing the overheating issue.

"Don't waste your time. Let me give you a ride instead."

He reached out, his grubby fingers brushing her arm.

Vivian finally looked up, her voice icy. "Remove your hand."

"Come on, sweetheart. It's scorching out here—you'll burn that pretty skin."

In one swift motion, Vivian yanked his arm and slammed the hood onto his wrist.

"Ahhh! My hand!" he howled, his palm trapped against the searing engine.

Vivian planted her stiletto on the hood, leaning in with a chilling smile. "Still offering that ride?"

"No! Let me go—please!"

Sweating and whimpering, the man crumpled in agony.
###Chapter 375

Vivian finally released her grip and sneered, "Take a good look at yourself before hitting on women. Move!"

"You're amazing, Viv!"

Sophia, lounging in the passenger seat, leaned out the window like she was watching a drama unfold. "Still too soft on him. Creeps like that get off on harassing women. Should've broken his arm!"

The man paled and bolted before she finished speaking.

Vivian slid back into the driver's seat, cool as ever. "A warning's enough. I can't afford to draw attention."

"Fine, we'll play it your way."

The engine roared to life, the sleek car weaving through traffic under the afternoon sun.

Neither noticed the camera capturing the entire scene.

Hours earlier, they'd arrived at Sophia's secret penthouse downtown—a recent purchase even her brother Nathaniel knew nothing about.

"You're safe here. Stay as long as you need. Ten years, twenty—no one would find you."

Vivian smirked. "So if assassins come knocking, I just hide here and poof, they vanish?"

"With your skills?" Sophia scoffed. "Anyone dumb enough to try would be signing their own death warrant."

"Speaking of which..." Vivian's fingers darted to Sophia's ribs. "You plotting to kill me?"

Sophia shrieked with laughter, squirming away.

Grown women? More like giggling schoolgirls.

Mid-tickle fight, Vivian suddenly sat up and grabbed her phone.

"What now?" Sophia smoothed her tousled hair.

"Haven't checked on the kids or Evelyn yet."

"Adrian! Abigail!" Sophia clapped like it was Christmas. She practically glued herself to the screen.

The call connected.

"Mommy!"

"Mommy!"

Two cherubic faces filled the display, their voices melting Vivian's heart.

"Did you two behave? Miss me?"

Abigail blinked her starry eyes. "So much! Did you see Aunt Sophia? Does she miss me?"

"Every second, princess." Sophia blew kisses. "I'd teleport just to pinch those cheeks!"

Vivian noticed Adrian's unusual silence. "What about you, sweetheart? Cat got your tongue?"
###Chapter 376

Adrian crossed his tiny arms, his little face scrunched up in concentration. The four-year-old mimicked an adult's posture, one hand thoughtfully stroking his chin.

"Mommy," he declared with all the gravity a child could muster, "I've decided. I don't like you anymore. Not even a little bit!"

Vivian suppressed a smile. With his sharp features and those piercing dark eyes, he was the spitting image of Nathaniel.

She crouched to his level, mirroring his seriousness. "Oh? So my little Adrian doesn't want me anymore? Not even a tiny bit? You won't miss me at all?"

The boy faltered. His thick brows knitted together, frustration flashing in his gaze.

"Mommy!" he huffed, tiny fists clenching. "You're being silly! What if someone hurts you when you're gone? I can't protect you from here!"

Her heart swelled. So that was it—her little warrior was worried.

"I promise I'll be careful," she said, ruffling his hair. "Just a few days, and I'll be back before you know it. Be good for Grandma Evelyn, okay? And take care of Abigail."

Her children were her greatest blessings.

Abigail was sunshine incarnate—sweet words, sweeter smiles, always knowing just how to lift her spirits.

Adrian, though, was different. Serious beyond his years, fiercely protective, with a quiet wisdom that often left her humbled. A boy of action, just like his father.

Sophia grinned, nudging the sulking child. "Don't worry, kiddo. I'll keep your mom safe. Nobody messes with my best friend!"

Adrian shot her a withering look. "Aunt Sophia, you can't even find your keys most days."

"Ouch!" Sophia clutched her chest dramatically. "That hurt, you little menace!"

The boy turned back to Vivian, lower lip trembling. "You promised we'd go together. But you left without us. I'm mad! I won't talk to you until you come home!"

Before she could respond, he spun on his heel and stormed off.

"Adrian! Wait—"

Evelyn patted her shoulder. "Don't fret, Miss Vivian. He's a smart boy—he'll understand. Let me talk to him."

Abigail nodded solemnly, her big eyes earnest. "I'll make him forgive you, Mommy. I'll cry until he says sorry!"

Vivian laughed, pulling her daughter close. "My secret weapon. Your brother can't resist those tears."

The little girl preened. "I'm the best, right?"

"The very best." Vivian kissed her forehead. "Dream of me tonight, sweetheart."

"Only if you dream of me too!"

Their goodbye stretched until Vivian finally, reluctantly, ended the call.

The silence that followed was heavy. Less than a day apart, and already her chest ached with missing them.

She clenched her fists.

Finish this. Get back to them. Fast.
###Chapter 377

Vivian slipped into her silk pajamas after her evening routine, joining Sophia on the plush king-sized bed. The soft glow of the bedside lamp cast a warm light over their intimate girl talk.

"Vivian, I have to admit—I'm seriously jealous of you."

Sophia nestled closer, letting out a wistful sigh. "Just look at your life. Stunning, wealthy, two adorable kids, and no toxic husband dragging you down. You're living every woman's fantasy. I'm tempted to just skip the man and get artificially inseminated at this point!"

Vivian laughed, shaking her head. "Don't be reckless! Raising kids is no walk in the park. Once they're here, there's no going back. The first three years alone will drain you. You can't even blink without worrying—if they get sick, it’s pure torture."

The past four years of raising Adrian and Abigail with Evelyn had been anything but easy. Vivian carried scars from those sleepless nights, the kind of pain money couldn’t erase. No nanny or paycheck could ease a mother’s relentless worry. From the moment she’d known she was pregnant, their happiness became her oxygen.

"Adrian was three when he spiked a fever so high he started convulsing. Midnight, no warning. Medicine did nothing—Evelyn tried everything, and still, his little body just kept burning up."

Vivian’s voice wavered. "I lost my mind that night. Ended up on my knees by the shore, screaming at the sky like some madwoman, begging any god listening to save him. By dawn, my voice was gone. My knees were bruised raw."

A shudder ran through her. Even now, the memory clawed at her throat.

Sophia gripped her arm, eyes wide. "Vivian, why didn’t you tell me? You suffered alone—"

Vivian shrugged. "What was there to say? Every mother goes through hell. Kids are equal parts joy and sacrifice. Don’t dive in unless you’re ready to drown in it."

"Do you regret it?"

"Regret what?"

"Having them. And..." Sophia hesitated. "Not crawling back to that bastard Nathaniel?"

"Never." Vivian’s answer was razor-sharp. "I knew the price when I chose to keep them. They’re my anchor. Without them?" She exhaled sharply. "I might’ve just followed my family into the grave."

Her lips curled at the mention of Nathaniel. "As for him? You said it—he’s trash. Leaving him was my best decision. Not a single regret."

Sophia grinned, punching the air. "That’s my girl! Unbreakable. Iconic."

"Enough about me." Vivian nudged her. "Where’s this ‘true love’ you were gushing about last week?"

Sophia’s cheeks flushed. She hid behind her hands, voice dropping to a whisper. "Okay, fine. I think... this one’s different."

The rare sincerity hooked Vivian instantly. "Details. Now."

They talked until the sky lightened, laughter and confessions weaving through the night. When sleep finally took them, it was tangled in shared secrets.

Morning came too soon. Sophia’s gasp ripped Vivian from drowsiness as her phone screen lit up.

"Vivian—holy hell. You need to see this."
###Chapter 378

Sophia Osborne burst into the room like a hurricane.

Vivian Lockhart barely cracked her eyes open, still half-asleep against the headboard.

"You're trending!" Sophia shoved her phone in Vivian's face, practically vibrating with excitement.

The screen showed yesterday's footage—Vivian in that skin-tight jumpsuit on Newport City's Marine Highway, delivering that brutal roundhouse kick to some creep's face. The angle captured everything: her razor-sharp cheekbones, mile-long legs, and that lethal grace that made the internet lose its collective mind.

Comments flooded in by the thousands.

"Holy hell, she's like some Bond girl crossed with a UFC fighter!"

"That kick could've shattered concrete. Someone check if that guy still has teeth!"

"New life goal: marry this woman immediately."

Sophia cackled as she scrolled through the memes—someone had even edited the clip with superhero sound effects. "They're calling you the 'Queen of Knockouts'! There's already fan accounts demanding a meetup at Harborview Pier."

Vivian groaned. Her face was crystal clear in every frame. So much for flying under the radar.

"Guess the low-profile plan's dead," Sophia said, flopping onto the bed. Then her eyes lit up. "Wonder how a certain someone will react when he sees this?"

Vivian's lips curled. "Nathaniel Blackwood's opinions stopped mattering four years ago." She snatched the phone, scanning the viral metrics. "If I can't hide... might as well own it."

Sophia's eyebrows shot up. "How?"

A slow smile spread across Vivian's face. "Lockhart Enterprises' new product launch is in 48 hours. Time the world remembered who really runs this company."

The plan had been to reveal herself gradually—but free publicity this explosive? She'd be stupid not to capitalize on it.

Sophia's phone suddenly erupted with calls. She didn't need to check the ID. "Uh-oh. That's Liam."

She barely got a syllable out before her brother's roar nearly blew out the speaker:

"SOPHIA! YOU KNEW VIVIAN WAS BACK AND DIDN'T TELL ME?!"
###Chapter 379

Nathaniel's voice crackled through the phone, sharp with barely contained fury. "Sophia! How dare you keep this from me? Tell me where you are right now or I swear—"

"I can't, Nate." Sophia's fingers tightened around her phone. "I promised Isabella. This stays between us."

"Nonsense!" Nathaniel's growl sent shivers down her spine. "Do you really think I won't tear this city apart to find you both?"

His sister exhaled sharply. Across the room, Isabella Lockhart arched an eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"See?" Sophia gestured dramatically with her free hand. "This is the real Nathaniel Blackwood. The polished CEO act? Pure theater."

A sudden silence. Then—

"Is she there with you?" Nathaniel's tone shifted instantly, the storm replaced by cautious warmth. "Boss? You're back in Newport City? Why didn't you tell me? What if something happened?"

Isabella plucked the phone from Sophia's grasp. "Didn't plan to stay long," she said lightly. Then, with deliberate mischief: "Though I must say, I'm shocked. Never pegged you for the yelling type."

"That's not—" Nathaniel's protest came too loud, too fast. He cleared his throat, forcing calm. "I'm always composed. Sophia just... tests limits."

Sophia's snort of laughter earned her a glare from across the room.

"Seriously, Nate," she wheezed, wiping her eyes. "Stop with the whisper-voice. It's creepy."

A dangerous pause. Then, silk-smooth: "Shall I freeze your trust fund this month, little sister?"

"Wait! No! I take it back!" Sophia's hands flew up in surrender. "Isabella, ignore everything I said. My brother is the epitome of maturity. Perfect husband material. Ideal father for Adrian and Abigail. Please don't reconsider marrying him or he'll murder me."

Isabella's laughter rang clear. "Relax. I've known Nathaniel for years." She brought the phone closer. "You're still at a hundred points, Blackwood. Once I handle this mess, we'll talk rings and vows."

The gasp was audible. "You mean it?" Nathaniel's voice cracked, all pretense of coolness shattered.

For years, he'd waited. Endured rejections, met every impossible standard on Isabella's infamous "spouse criteria" list. Zero to a hundred, through sheer stubborn devotion.

"Yes." Isabella's throat tightened unexpectedly. "You've stood by me through everything. The kids already see you as family."

Sophia dabbed at her eyes, overcome. "Damn it, Nate. You actually did it."

On the other end of the line, Nathaniel Blackwood—ruthless CEO, master of control—was very possibly crying.
###Chapter 380

Vivian remained unfazed by her recent viral news scandal. After freshening up, she slipped into a sleek black dress with minimal makeup, preparing to visit her parents' graves.

Today marked the ninth anniversary of their tragic passing.

"Would you like company?" Sophia offered gently.

"No. This is something I need to do alone."

Having been away from Newport City for four years, this was Vivian's first visit back—her first chance to properly honor them. There were too many private words waiting to be spoken.

She climbed into the same crimson Ferrari from yesterday and sped toward the cemetery.

August's summer heat blazed outside, yet the marble headstones stood silent and cool amidst the overgrown grass, untouched by seasons.

Parking the car, Vivian adjusted her black sunglasses before walking toward the graves with white daisies in hand.

But someone had beaten her there.

An extravagant bouquet already lay before the headstone—identical to ones she'd seen years prior. The realization struck her: someone had been visiting her parents all this time.

"Who?" The question burned in her mind.

Years ago, an exquisite amber pendant had been left here. Nathaniel Blackwood owned its twin, making Vivian suspect him initially. But that theory crumbled under scrutiny.

Nathaniel was ice incarnate. A man who'd shown her nothing but indifference. Why would he care about strangers' graves? Especially after their bitter divorce severed all ties.

"Enough." She shook her head, dispelling the foolish thought.

Her parents had been kind souls. Perhaps an old friend still mourned them, sending annual flowers as tribute.

Placing her daisies beside the mystery bouquet, Vivian's throat tightened at their smiling photos etched in stone.

Mom, Dad. I'm finally home.

"Four years became eight. My world shattered and rebuilt itself." Her fingers traced the engraved names. "I walked away from a marriage that destroyed me. From a man who never valued me. No regrets—I've never been stronger."

A shaky breath. "Your daughter hasn't disgraced the Lockhart name. Our family will reclaim its glory. And..." Her voice softened. "You have grandchildren now. Adrian and Abigail—my little miracles. Next time, I'll bring them to meet you."

Tears blurred her vision. "Watch over us. Keep them safe."

For a heartbeat, the photographed smiles seemed to deepen. Would they be proud of the woman she'd become?

Wiping her cheeks, Vivian composed herself. The vulnerable daughter vanished; the unshakable CEO reemerged.

She turned to leave—

A shadow moved between the headstones.
###Chapter 381

"Vivian, it's really you! After all these years, I finally found you."

The man standing before her was none other than Walter Reynolds—her despicable uncle.

"You?"

Vivian scoffed. "Get lost. Every time I visit my parents, you're lurking around like a parasite."

"You're right, I am a parasite." Walter wiped his eyes dramatically. "But thank God I kept coming back. Otherwise, I'd never have seen you again."

His voice cracked. "You don't know how much I've suffered all these years. I missed you terribly!"

"Missed me?" Vivian's lips curled in disdain. "You mean you missed my money."

Walter rubbed his stubbled chin, shifting uncomfortably.

"What now? Already blew through the 7 million Ethan gave you four years ago?"

"Ah, that?" He waved a hand dismissively. "Gone in two years. Thought I'd multiply it in the stock market. Turns out, luck wasn't on my side."

"Not my problem."

A cold smirk played on Vivian's lips. "Surely you're not delusional enough to think I'd help you?"

She wasn't that forgiving.

The memories of what Walter did to the Lockhart family still burned fresh. Letting him walk free was mercy enough.

"No, no! I've changed." Walter clasped his hands earnestly. "I'm living honestly now. I come every year because family matters to me. Can't we move past this?"

His words carried surprising sincerity.

Four years could change a man.

This wasn't the same greedy leech she remembered.

Vivian arched a brow. "Oh? What's this honest living of yours?"

"All thanks to your husband!" Walter's face lit up with admiration. "When I lost everything, I swallowed my pride and went to Mr. Blackwood. Not only did he give me another chance, he got me a job. I manage a workshop at one of Blackwood Group's factories now—decent salary, steady work."

"Ethan did that?"

Vivian was stunned.

"He's a saint, that man!" Walter gestured to the row of fresh flowers by the graves. "See these? Every death anniversary, rain or shine, he's the first one here. Always brings the grandest arrangements."

"So... it was him."

Vivian's chest tightened as she studied the blooms.

Even after everything, she hadn't expected this side of Ethan. The man who left amber pendants and remembered dates.

"Vivian, let me treat you both to dinner! To celebrate your return and thank Mr. Blackwood properly!"

Before she could refuse, Walter whipped out his phone and dialed Ethan.
###Chapter 382

"You have Ethan Blackwood's number? That's unexpected."

Vivian was genuinely taken aback.

The Ethan she remembered was cold, aloof, and unapproachable. He wasn't the type to hand out his personal number, let alone go out of his way to help friends—or family.

Yet here he was, making exceptions for his ex-wife's uncle?

As the phone continued to ring, Walter puffed up with misplaced confidence. "Well, we are family. And I am his elder. He owes me at least this much respect."

Fate, however, had other plans.

The call went unanswered. He tried again—only for it to be instantly declined.

Vivian arched a brow, arms crossed. "Oh yes. Very respectful."

Walter coughed awkwardly. "My nephew-in-law is a CEO. He's a busy man. I'll try again later—he usually picks up then. And even if he doesn't respect me, he'll respect you."

"Walter," Vivian cut in sharply, "we've been divorced for years. Stop calling him your nephew-in-law. I don't want misunderstandings. If you want to cling to him, fine—but leave me out of it."

Her tone left no room for argument.

"Right, right. My mistake." Walter wet his lips nervously. "But you must let me treat you and Mr. Blackwood to dinner tonight. I've carried guilt for years over how I treated you and your mother. I've changed now."

He clasped his hands earnestly. "I want to be a better father. A better husband. A better uncle. Let me do this—for your mother's sake."

Vivian studied him silently.

Her once-worthless uncle did seem different.

No more flashy clothes he couldn't afford. Just simple, worn fabrics. Dust clung to his shoes—proof he'd been working hard.

Walter was her mother's only brother. She'd doted on him, hoping he'd someday step up for the Lockhart name.

When tragedy struck, he'd cut ties to save himself. But if he'd truly changed... maybe forgiveness wasn't impossible.

Noticing her hesitation, Walter ventured carefully, "Vivian... are you avoiding this dinner because you're not over him?"

Her laugh was icy. "Does it look like I'm not over him?"

"Frankly? Yes."

He spoke like a man who'd seen it all. "When it comes to love, indifference is the real closure. Avoiding him? That's the opposite."

His words struck a nerve.

Vivian exhaled. "Fine. One dinner. I don't care."

They'd cross paths eventually anyway. Might as well get it over with—and return that damned amber pendant.

Walter beamed. "Perfect! Your aunt and Emily will be thrilled. Especially Emily—she idolizes you. Talks about you nonstop. Drives me mad."

"Emily's eighteen now, right?"

"Just turned. Her birthday wish? To see you again." He chuckled. "Guess dreams do come true."

Vivian nodded. "Then let's go. I do miss them."
###Chapter 383

Emily Reynolds was Vivian Lockhart's only cousin. As a child, she'd been Vivian's shadow, following her everywhere.

She adored Vivian.

But when Walter Reynolds betrayed the Lockhart family, he cut off all contact between Emily and Vivian. Otherwise, their bond would've been unbreakable.

Walter's modest apartment sat in a quiet neighborhood on the east side of Newport City. Three bedrooms, one living room—cozy but unremarkable.

When Vivian stepped inside, the scent of home-cooked food filled the air. Margaret Reynolds was chopping vegetables in the kitchen while Emily belted out a pop song in her room.

"Look who's here!" Walter boomed, grinning from ear to ear.

Mother and daughter rushed to the living room. Their jaws dropped at the sight of Vivian.

"Viv! Oh my god, it's really you!" Emily squealed, throwing her arms around Vivian. "Seven years! Where have you been? Dad visits the cemetery every year, saying you'd come back someday to visit your parents. And he was right!"

Vivian smiled. "You're all grown up now. Last time I saw you, you were still a kid."

At eighteen, Emily radiated youthful energy.

"Aunt Margaret, it's been too long."

Margaret—a practical homemaker—wiped her hands on her apron, flustered. "Welcome back, dear."

"Make yourself at home," Walter said. "Margaret, break out the good wine. We're celebrating tonight. And we've got another guest—Mr. Blackwood is joining us."

Margaret froze. "Nathaniel Blackwood? Here?"

To them, the CEO of Blackwood Group was practically a myth. The idea of him in their humble apartment was surreal.

"Why not? He's Vivian's ex-husband and our benefactor. Now get cooking—this meal better impress."

Margaret marched to the kitchen like a soldier heading into battle.

Emily frowned. "Dad, be real. Mr. Blackwood runs a billion-dollar empire. Why would he waste time here?"

Walter scoffed. "For Vivian, obviously. She vanishes for four years, then reappears? Of course he'd come."

Emily nodded. "True. Ice-cold as he is, he's always looked out for us. I wouldn't have gotten into Stanford Arts without him. He's definitely not over her."

Father and daughter launched into a heated analysis of Nathaniel's lingering feelings, oblivious to Vivian's discomfort.

Four years was long enough to erase anything. Bridges had burned. Some things weren't meant to last.

Walter grabbed his phone. "I'll call him again. We'll know soon enough."

This time, the call connected after three rings.

A deep, icy voice answered. "What is it?"
###Chapter 384

The voice Vivian hadn't heard in four years still carried that same icy detachment.

She listened calmly, her expression unreadable. Not a single ripple of emotion disturbed her composure.

"U-um, Mr. Blackwood? Sorry to disturb you—"

Walter hadn't expected Nathaniel to answer so quickly. Nervousness made his words stumble. "My niece Vivian just returned to Newport City today. After disappearing for years, it's quite a shock to see her again. Since you've been so kind to our family these past years, I wanted to invite you to dinner with us. You—"

"No."

Nathaniel's refusal was immediate. Cold. Final.

The line went dead before Walter could respond.

"Mr. Blackwood? Mr. Blackwood?"

Silence.

He tried calling again. The number had been blocked.

"Viv, don't take it personally. He's a busy man—CEO of Blackwood Group. I'll try again later with Emily's phone."

Walter glanced at Vivian, guilt twisting his features. He'd expected better from Nathaniel, who'd always treated the Reynolds family with consideration. This sudden hostility? It could only mean one thing—he was avoiding Vivian. She must be devastated!

"It's fine."

Vivian shrugged, smiling. "If he comes, we'll set a place. If not, more food for me. No big deal."

She wasn't pretending. Nathaniel was just a stranger from her past now. He held no power over her emotions.

Emily frowned, disappointment flashing across her face. "Tsk. I misjudged him. Can't even face you over a meal when you're perfectly fine with it. Pathetic."

Walter shook his head. "You don't understand. If he'd truly moved on, he wouldn't care. This reaction? Classic unresolved feelings. I'll reach out again—"

Vivian laughed. "You're overcomplicating it. A high-profile CEO refusing to dine with commoners is normal. And given our history? Avoiding me prevents awkwardness with his current girlfriend."

"Exactly!" Emily nodded. "He's been dating that Delacroix woman for years now. Paparazzi catch them vacationing together all the time. Bet he forgot you ages ago."

"No, no." Walter disagreed. "As a man, I know men. If he'd truly moved on, he wouldn't have supported our family all these years. Or visited your parents' graves annually. Those aren't the actions of someone who's over you."

"Then why refuse dinner? Why get a new girlfriend? Sounds like a coward to me."

Emily's eyes sparkled with mischief. She grabbed Walter's arm. "Dad, wanna bet? I say Nathaniel's completely over Viv—"

"No more gambling!"

"If you win, I'll do dishes for a year!"

"...Fine. I bet he hasn't moved on. You'll see—"

Their argument escalated into a full-blown wager.

Vivian sighed, retreating from the battlefield to explore the house.

The Reynolds home wasn't lavish, but warmth radiated from every corner. A sense of peace settled over her here.

In the study, a family portrait sat atop the piano. Walter's family. Her own parents. Her late grandparents. Her teenage self, frozen in time beside them.

Vivian stared at the photo, eyes burning. That girl in the picture—carefree, surrounded by love—had no idea how precious those moments were.

How fleeting.
###Chapter 385

The storms of life had left Vivian Lockhart battered and scarred. There was no returning to those innocent days of carefree youth.

"Viv, you and Aunt Margaret were absolutely radiant in this photo. Your beauty was otherworldly, like your genes were engineered differently," Emily Reynolds remarked as she entered the room, studying the family portrait with admiration.

"Don't be ridiculous. You're stunning too. The Reynolds bloodline never disappoints," Vivian countered, gently cupping Emily's still-youthful face.

Though Emily's features weren't conventionally striking, they possessed a soft, approachable charm that would captivate audiences - perfect for the entertainment industry she dreamed of joining.

"Guess what? I've got a little secret," Emily giggled, pulling out her phone. "I'm actually an influencer with over two million followers! My TikTok handle is SweetPea. Check it out!"

Vivian's eyebrows shot up seeing the verified account with 2.2 million followers. "Impressive! But remember, Stanford University should still be your priority. That acceptance letter from Mr. Blackwood is an opportunity you can't waste."

"I know," Emily nodded earnestly. "I'll make you both proud, I promise." Then hesitantly added, "Viv...are you okay? After everything with Mr. Blackwood?"

Vivian blinked in confusion. "Why wouldn't I be?"

"Well...you were crazy about him before. Now you're back after four years and he won't even have dinner with you. That's got to sting."

Vivian shrugged. "That was then. Honestly, I can barely remember his face anymore. It doesn't matter to me now."

Emily's eyes sparkled with mischief. "In that case...I've got an idea." She whispered her plan into Vivian's ear.

Vivian's expression turned skeptical. "Are you serious?"

"Dead serious!" Emily clasped her hands dramatically. "Please Viv, just this once? If this works, I'll owe you forever!"

"...Fine," Vivian conceded reluctantly.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Group headquarters...

Employees were buzzing over the viral video of Vivian's return. Phones pinged across departments as whispers spread.

"Oh my God! Is that Mrs. Blackwood? She's back!"
"She looks incredible! That exit was legendary!"
"Do you think there's still hope for them? The Blackwood ship might sail again!"

Ethan Young, Nathaniel Blackwood's assistant, was among the most excited. He burst into the CEO's office waving his phone. "Sir! You need to see what's trending on Twitter right now!"
###Chapter 386

"I've seen it."

Ethan Blackwood didn't even glance up from his desk, his voice chillingly indifferent.

Four years had done nothing to dull his striking features—if anything, his expression was even colder now.

"You—you've seen it?"

Ethan Young couldn't hide his disbelief. "No way. If you'd actually seen it, there's no chance you'd be reacting like this."

The trending topic was about Vivian Lockhart—the woman who'd vanished for four years, the one Mr. Blackwood had never stopped thinking about. And this was his reaction?

Ethan finally lifted his gaze. Slowly, he capped his pen, spinning it between his long fingers.

"How should I have reacted?"

"If you'd seen it, you'd be on your way to meet Miss Lockhart right now. At the very least, you'd be losing your damn mind! There's no way you'd be sitting here like nothing happened!"

Ethan Young was practically vibrating with frustration.

"What does she have to do with me?" Ethan's voice was ice. "Why would I care that she's back in Newport City?"

The question left Ethan Young speechless.

Ethan scoffed. "Do I look like I'm still hung up on her?"

"Uh—yes!"

At the risk of being thrown out, Ethan Young muttered, "You might act like you're over it, but you still stare at her picture every night. And don't even get me started on when you're drunk—you bawl like a damn baby and cling to me like I'm your lifeline. Remember last month when you—"

"Enough."

Ethan's expression darkened, cutting him off. "She means nothing to me. Just a footnote in my life. Where she is, what she does—none of it matters. Don't bring her up again."

"But—"

"If you've got this much free time, I can always assign you more work. Now get out."

The sudden shift in tone sent Ethan Young scrambling. He didn't dare push further, retreating from the CEO's office before the storm hit.

Outside, a group of executives hovered, hungry for gossip.

"Well? Did Mr. Blackwood lose it? Is he rushing to see her?"

Ethan Young just shook his head, exasperated.

Their CEO was an enigma. No one could ever guess what he was really thinking.

The moment the door closed, Ethan's phone rang.

The first call was from Nathan Prescott. His voice nearly shattered Ethan's eardrums.

"Ethan! Check the trending topic! It's your ex-wife! After four years, she's back—and she's a goddess now! That face, that body—no man could resist her. When are you—"

Ethan hung up before he could finish.

Then Dominic Harrington called.

"Ethan. Vivian's back. You okay?"

"I'm fine."

"Really? Want to grab a drink?"

"I'm fine."

"Come on, man. After everything these past few years—"

"Busy. Talk later."

Ethan ended the call before Dominic could finish.
###Chapter 387

Ethan Blackwood was terrified to keep talking. Dominic Harrington's unexpected understanding made him feel like he was on the verge of breaking down.

His phone kept ringing, but Ethan ignored it. He powered it off, craving silence.

Removing his rimless glasses, he leaned back in his luxurious office chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. A wave of exhaustion hit him.

His long fingers massaged his temples. The sharp angles of his nose only accentuated his striking features—cold, refined, and unreadable.

For four years, he'd built a fortress around himself, functioning like a machine. Work was his only rhythm—no highs, no lows, just relentless control.

Some might call it misery, but he thrived in it.

Then why? Why did Vivian Lockhart have to resurface after vanishing without a trace?

And why did everyone assume he'd come crawling back to her like some lovesick fool?

Absolutely not.

Ethan exhaled sharply, forcing himself to refocus. He powered up his computer, determined to push her from his thoughts.

The Blackwood Group was on the brink of launching the NEON-X, their revolutionary smartphone.

For the first time, it would feature the Quantum-6 chip, a groundbreaking innovation developed by QuantumTech. The entire tech industry was watching.

Currently in testing, the NEON-X was one step away from mass production.

Ethan and the board were certain—this phone would dominate the market for the next decade.

Four years of meticulous planning, billions invested. Failure wasn’t an option.

Knock, knock.

Ethan barely glanced up as the door opened.

"Come in."

Ethan Young stepped inside, hesitating.

"Mr. Blackwood, I—uh—have something you might want to see."

Ethan’s gaze remained fixed on his screen. "Spit it out."

"You should check out an influencer called SweetPea on TikTok. There’s… something you’ll find interesting."

Ethan’s fingers stilled.

"SweetPea?"

He had no intention of indulging this nonsense, but curiosity gnawed at him.

"Fine, I’ll be blunt. Vivian Lockhart is live-streaming right now. She’s… different. More stunning than ever. And the number of men drooling over her? Insane."

Live-streaming?

Vivian Lockhart?

Ethan’s expression didn’t flicker. "And why should I care?"

Ethan Young shrugged. "Just thought you’d want to know. But hey, ten million viewers won’t miss one. I’m off to watch my goddess now."

He vanished before Ethan could respond.

Silence settled, but Ethan’s focus was shattered.

Against his better judgment, he unlocked his phone and downloaded TikTok.

"Let’s see what the hell she’s up to."
###Chapter 388

Ethan Blackwood found Emily Carter's TikTok account within minutes.

Vivian Lockhart's stunning features filled his phone screen.

The small device held nuclear-level destructive power in its glowing display.

Ethan's grip tightened unconsciously. His piercing gaze remained fixed on the video.

"Hey lovelies! Welcome to SweetPea's live stream!" Emily chirped, adjusting her cat ear headband. "As you know, the hit show 'Love Connection' is casting non-celebrities. I secretly auditioned!"

The pink-clad influencer batted her eyelashes. "The producers said whoever gets the most donations tonight gets on the show. Help your girl make it big, okay?"

'Love Connection' was the golden ticket from influencer to celebrity status.

Emily had dragged Vivian onto her channel for extra views. "Meet tonight's special guest - the viral sensation herself, my cousin Vivian!"

"Hi everyone," Vivian forced a smile, making heart hands as rehearsed. "Please support Emily! Love you all!"

The cringe nearly made her vomit. This was the most embarrassing performance of her life.

Yet the audience ate it up. The chat exploded.

"Goddess Vivian! Marry me!"
"Queen of versatility! How can someone be this perfect?"
"Step on me please!"
"I volunteer as tribute!"

Emily's eyes widened at the flood of donations scrolling across her screen.

"Thank you for the 1500 Bits!"
"5000 Bits! You're amazing!"
"10000 Bits! Oh my god!"

Viewership skyrocketed from 10 to 30 million - unprecedented numbers for Emily's channel.

Her hands shook with nervous excitement. Normally she barely cracked 100K viewers.

When Vivian stepped aside, the numbers immediately dropped.

"Wait, don't leave!" Emily panicked. "Vivian just went to grab water! She'll be right back with a surprise!"

Some stayed, but many viewers disappeared.

"Quick question everyone," Emily improvised. "Which version of Vivian do you prefer? The badass from the viral video or this sweet angel?"

The chat erupted again.

"Both! I'd love her even if she picked her nose on camera!"
###Chapter 389

"Goddesses should remain in heaven, yet here she walks among us. I'm completely enchanted."

"Every move she makes is perfection. Bring her back on screen!"

The chat exploded with adoration until one jarring comment sliced through the praise.

"Pathetic performance."

Like a match dropped in gasoline, the single insult ignited fury. Viewers turned rabid.

"Stream yourself then, coward. Let's see your flawless act."

"Blind fool! She's 100% authentic—no filters, no fakery."

"Anonymous trolls always hide. Probably some creep obsessed with her. Ban him!"

Emily spotted the brewing storm and rushed to intervene. "Everyone, calm down. ShadowWalker, these accusations are baseless. My cousin Vivian is genuine—how is this an act?"

But ShadowWalker doubled down. "Total fraud."

Vivian observed from off-camera, intrigued by this lone dissenter.

Emily's pulse raced. The competition's final thirty minutes loomed. Though Vivian's appearance had skyrocketed her to third place, the top streamers' massive followings kept them just out of reach.

Desperation sparked an idea. She yanked Vivian back into frame.

"Since you all love my cousin... here's a deal. Whoever pushes me to first place wins a private dinner with Vivian. One night only—don't miss this!"

The chat detonated. Donations flooded in like a dam had burst.

Vivian arched a brow but didn't protest. If a meal secured Emily's spot on Love Connection, she'd play along.

"Want to sit across from me?" Vivian tilted her head, flashing a smile that sent hearts racing. "Then make it happen."

The frenzy reached fever pitch—until ShadowWalker struck again. "Disgusting."

Emily's fingers hovered over the ban button. "Leave or get removed, ShadowWalker. Vivian doesn't need toxic fans."

Then the screen lit up with a notification that froze her mid-threat.

ShadowWalker had donated $150,000—catapulting Emily straight to #1.

"Th-thank you, ShadowWalker!" Emily's voice cracked. Her knees nearly buckled. "Thank you... sir."
###Chapter 390

The chat exploded with reactions to ShadowWalker's insane donations. Messages flooded the screen at lightning speed.

"Holy shit, this dude's loaded! Who throws around cash like this?"

"Four million just for a date? Someone's got it bad..."

"Bet it's that CEO trying to win back his ex-wife."

Vivian studied the anonymous profile picture, her curiosity burning. Who was this mysterious benefactor?

Just when everyone thought the drama was over, another player entered the game.

NightHawk swooped in with a staggering 160,000 donation, snatching the top spot from ShadowWalker.

The viewer count skyrocketed to 50 million as the chat went wild.

Emily's voice trembled. "T-thank you, NightHawk! This changes everything - you'll be joining Vivian for dinner instead!"

Her knees nearly buckled again. Since when did millionaires throw money around like confetti?

But ShadowWalker wasn't done. Another 10,000 hit the counter, reigniting the bidding war.

For five heart-stopping minutes, the top spot ping-ponged between the two rivals. The chat exploded with a live countdown: "5...4...3...2...1!"

When the dust settled, ShadowWalker reclaimed victory with nearly 4 million in total donations.

"Thank you!" Emily gushed, practically bowing to the camera. "Someone's clearly smitten with my cousin! See you tomorrow night!"

Touched by the gesture, Vivian leaned closer to the lens. "Whoever you are... I'll be waiting." She flashed a sultry smile and blew a kiss, her lips parting slightly.

On the other end of the screen, Nathaniel Blackwood - aka ShadowWalker - remained stone-faced despite the massive expenditure. Only a slight twitch in his jaw betrayed his irritation.

That damn woman had played him again. The手法 felt painfully familiar.

"Goddamn it."

He couldn't explain why he'd lost control - both emotionally and financially. In a rare moment of pettiness, he flicked Vivian's image on his phone screen.

But just as his finger connected, she blew that kiss. Nathaniel froze mid-motion, his scowl softening imperceptibly.

His thumb traced her face on the screen with unexpected tenderness. "Vivian... you're finally back."

The office door burst open.

"Mr. Blackwood! You can't just-"

His secretary's halfhearted protest was pointless. The entire office had watched the livestream. Everyone knew exactly what their usually composed CEO had been doing.

Nathaniel barely had time to lock his phone before Oliver Prescott strolled in, grinning like the Cheshire cat.

If word got out that the mighty Nathaniel Blackwood had spent four million just to secure a dinner date, he'd never live it down.
###Chapter 391

Nathaniel's phone buzzed with a notification just as Oliver Prescott barged into his office.

"Tell me you saw that livestream," Oliver demanded, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Please tell me you're that idiot who got played by his own wife."

Nathaniel Blackwood didn't even glance up from his contract drafts. "What livestream?"

"Cut the crap." Oliver leaned against the desk, grinning. "Your wife just trended worldwide. No way you missed it."

"I'm working." Translation: Get out.

Oliver knew better than to push—Nathaniel’s patience was thinner than ice in summer. But curiosity won. He snatched the phone Nathaniel had tossed aside earlier.

"Screen's locked. Suspicious." Oliver smirked. "Let’s see your guilty little secret—"

A hand clamped around his wrist like a vise.

"Try it," Nathaniel said, voice low. "I dare you."

Oliver swallowed hard and set the phone back down. "Relax, man. So what if you watched? Nothing to be ashamed of."

Except, he thought, that time you turned the world upside down searching for her, only to get scammed by your own wife. The memory hit him like a champagne bubble—impossible to suppress.

Four years ago, Nathaniel had stormed into Bali, convinced he’d corner Vivian. Instead, he’d ended up begging villagers for directions after she vanished—again. The video of him offering absurd bribes had gone viral within minutes.

Oliver snorted. Then full-on laughed, clutching his stomach.

"You done?" Nathaniel’s knuckles cracked.

"Y-yeah," Oliver wheezed, wiping tears. "But seriously, go talk to her. Before someone else does." His grin faded. "That chat was full of wolves, Nate."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Not happening."

"Bullshit. You’re still obsessed."

"It’s over." The words were final. "If there was a chance, I wouldn’t have waited four years."

Oliver arched a brow. "Or maybe you just couldn’t find her."

The temperature in the room dropped. Oliver backtracked fast. "Fine, fine. But if you’re really over her..." He smirked. "Guess I’ll shoot my shot. I was donor number three, by the way."

Nathaniel’s head snapped up. "Who was second?"
###Chapter 392

"How should I know?"

Nathan Prescott instantly caught the underlying implication and smirked. "Ethan, why are you only asking about the second-highest bidder? Not the first? That's pretty telling."

Logically, people would be curious about the top donor. Who cared about second place?

Ethan Blackwood pressed his lips together, his icy expression warning Nathan to back off.

But Nathan never knew when to quit. "Four million for a dinner date? That's got to be some kind of record. So… you're going tomorrow night, right?"

Instead of answering, Ethan fired back. "When it comes to spending on women, I can't compete with you. How much have you dropped on Cassandra Whitmore these past few years? Forty million? You're the real whale here."

Nathan's face stiffened. He looked away, muttering, "There's nothing between us. Strictly professional. I invest because she has potential."

"Potential?" Ethan scoffed. "Four years of heavy funding, and she's still a nobody. Is her talent losing money for your company?"

Nathan rubbed his nose defensively. "These things take time. We're lining up more films for her. She’ll break through eventually."

"Talent isn’t just hard work. Some people have it. Others don’t." A smug glint flashed in Ethan's eyes. "Take Vivian, for example. Disappeared for years, yet the moment she returned—boom. Instant fame. Money can't buy that."

Nathan rolled his eyes. "Wow, someone’s proud. Thought you didn’t care?"

Ethan frowned. "Do I look proud?"

"Extremely."

Realizing it was true, Ethan schooled his expression. "So. Were you serious about pursuing her?"

Nathan grinned, finally getting a reaction. "Dead serious. If she’s not yours anymore, all bets are off. Shame to let someone else snatch her up."

"Fine." Ethan’s voice was flat. "Then I’ll make a move on Cassandra. There was always something there. I like my chances."

Nathan choked. "Bro, I was joking! You win, okay?"

He’d only wanted to provoke Ethan into admitting his feelings. But Ethan had turned the tables effortlessly.

Ethan smirked. "So you’re finally settling down? Done playing the field?"

"Not a chance." Nathan waved a hand dismissively. "Cassandra’s not my type. Too bony. She’s just another fish in the pond."

"Really?" Ethan lifted his phone. "Want me to send her that recording?"

"Don’t!" Nathan lunged for the device, suddenly serious.

Even if he wasn’t interested, Cassandra was still his star investment. He couldn’t afford to break her morale.
###Chapter 393

The two grown men bickered over the phone like children. After several heated exchanges, Nathaniel finally declared, "Stay out of my business with that woman from now on, and this recording won't reach Cassandra."

"Fine, you win. No more meddling or gossip about your affairs." Oliver sounded thoroughly defeated.

"Good boy." Nathaniel nodded in satisfaction.

As always, the mere threat of involving Cassandra was enough to silence even the most persistent gossip like Oliver.

Oliver tried one last desperate attempt before retreating. "You're still coming to tomorrow's dinner, right?"

Seeing Nathaniel unlock his phone with a threatening gesture, Oliver immediately backtracked. "Never mind! Forget I asked."

Though secretly, Oliver thought, 'Keep playing hard to get, Nathaniel. You'll regret this!'

Emily remained in stunned silence after ending the livestream.

Her eyes widened in disbelief as she checked the account balance.

"Holy shit! Even after platform fees, we're looking at millions... They weren't kidding when they said even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes."

Vivian couldn't help but laugh. "Who are you calling a blind squirrel now?"

"Me! I'm the squirrel. You're the golden goose. I'm never letting you go, Viv. Till death do us part!" Emily showered Vivian with enthusiastic kisses.

"Okay, okay! You're getting saliva everywhere..." Vivian finally managed to push her away with a sigh. "I never expected that kind of response. If I'd known my face alone could make this much money, I wouldn't have wasted years on R&D."

"Wait, what? You've been doing research? What kind? That's amazing!"

"Not that amazing. Just slightly above average intelligence." Vivian flashed a smug smile before adding mysteriously, "You'll find out soon enough what I've been working on."

Emily changed the subject. "Thanks to you, I got us spots on that dating show. I promised the top bidder a candlelit dinner with you. You okay with that?"

Vivian shrugged with mild interest. "I am curious to see what this mystery man looks like."

"Then let's make it Skyview Restaurant. I'll send the invitation." Emily opened the app and messaged ShadowWalker.

[ShadowWalker, your goddess awaits tomorrow at 8pm, Skyview Restaurant. Don't be late!]

The reply took forever to come through.

When it finally arrived, both girls read it and immediately saw red.

"What kind of idiot is this?"
###Chapter 394

ShadowWalker's reply flashed on screen: "Maybe I'll show up. Maybe I won't."

The arrogance practically dripped from those words. Even without seeing his face, they could picture the smirk.

Emily clicked open ShadowWalker's profile. Blank. Completely empty.

"Brand new account. Default avatar. Zero information. Yet his first move was dropping 4 million dollars." Emily's eyes narrowed. "He came specifically for you, Vivian."

She leaned forward, voice dropping to a whisper. "Think it's Nathaniel Blackwood?"

Vivian Lockhart's lips curved as she studied the generic silhouette. "Possibly. We'll know tomorrow."

She could trace his IP in seconds if she wanted. But where was the fun in that? The mystery intrigued her. Would he actually appear?

The clock struck midnight when Vivian finally returned to Sophia Osborne's penthouse.

Nathaniel wasn't the only surprise waiting. Oliver Prescott sat stiffly on the sofa, worry lines etching his usually carefree face.

"Finally." Oliver sprang up, relief washing over him. "Another hour and I would've mobilized SWAT."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Drama queen. Who could possibly touch her? She's the predator, not the prey." Her manicured fingers gestured at the muted TV screen still displaying Vivian's livestream highlights. "Did you see tonight's numbers? My girl broke records. Two hours. Millions harvested. You should teach masterclasses, Viv."

Vivian stretched, exhaustion creeping in. "It's late. Aren't you two tired?"

"Couldn't sleep," Sophia confessed, grabbing Vivian's wrist. "Not until we dissect tonight's mystery." Her eyes glittered with mischief. "The 4 million dollar man. Who is he?"

Vivian shrugged. "No idea."

"Liar."

"Honestly."

"You're not even curious?"

Vivian smirked. "Money's cleared. That's all that matters."

Her gaze shifted to Oliver's unusual silence. Normally he'd be cracking jokes by now.

She nudged him playfully. "What's with the long face, Master Prescott? Not jealous it wasn't you, I hope?"

Oliver ran a hand through his hair, the gesture weary. "Wish I could play sugar daddy. These days?" He laughed bitterly. "The Prescott fortune's tied up in Lockhart Enterprises. I need three approvals just to expense a business lunch."

Vivian ruffled his hair like comforting a child. "Poor baby. No more playboy funds. Don't worry—"

"I'm serious, Viv." Oliver caught her hand, uncharacteristically earnest. "The gold-diggers vanished when the money dried up. You're all I've got now."

She laughed, but there was warmth in it. "Relax. Once we settle this mess, I'll marry you. Keep you in the lifestyle you deserve."

The words were teasing, but something flickered in Oliver's eyes—something that wasn't joking at all.
###Chapter 395

Vivian appeared to be joking, but her words carried deadly seriousness.

Without the Lockhart family's complete backing these past four years, she never would've risen so swiftly. Nor could she have returned with such unshakable confidence.

Fear didn't exist in her vocabulary anymore. The only thing that terrified her was letting Nathaniel down.

"Now that's what I like to hear."

Nathaniel had been stewing in jealousy all evening. His striking features finally relaxed, like storm clouds parting to reveal sunlight.

Ah, the golden days. Once known as "Newport City's Young Devil," even the cockiest elites gave him wide berth to avoid his notorious temper.

Now? Reduced to Vivian's obedient lapdog.

Gone were his wild ways. No more womanizing. No more bullying. He even helped little old ladies cross streets now - a regular boy scout.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "If you're not the top bidder, you must be second? This isn't your first charity scam, after all."

She and Nathaniel had pulled similar stunts on Ethan at galas before.

Nathaniel shook his head. "Broke as a joke. Couldn't swing it even if I wanted to."

"Odd. Then who?"

Vivian exhaled, brushing the thought aside. Probably just another wealthy admirer dazzled by her charm.

After freshening up, she retreated to her suite.

It would be afternoon on Coral Isle now. Vivian video-called Evelyn.

"Miss Lockhart! Are you alright? Saw you trending everywhere. That bastard hasn't bothered you, has he?"

Though advanced in years, Evelyn kept up with online gossip. She'd seen Vivian's sudden fame explode across feeds.

Her greatest fear was Ethan causing trouble.

"Doing splendidly. No sign of him - likely forgotten I exist."

"Thank heavens."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. "May that scoundrel never darken your door again. Or the children's. Best you both wipe each other from memory."

Vivian's expression remained neutral. She changed subjects. "How are Adrian and Abigail?"

"Oh! I meant to tell you—"

Managing both children alone overwhelmed Evelyn. Their brilliance constantly outpaced her.

"Adrian's been inconsolable since you left. Locked himself in his lab, says he won't emerge until you return—"

Vivian's lips curved. "That boy's curiosity knows no bounds. Always tinkering since he could crawl. My son through and through. Future Nobel laureate."

"And Abigail? Is she angry with me?"

"Took it much better. Not angry - just mentions you constantly. Made a toy phone to 'call' you regularly."

"Evelyn, fetch them please. I'd like to chat."

Longing for her children ached in Vivian's chest. She needed to see their faces.

"Of course, Miss Lockhart. One moment—"

Evelyn called for Adrian and Abigail.

Abigail came running. But Adrian was nowhere to be found—
###Chapter 396

Vivian's weariness melted away the instant Abigail's face appeared on screen. A rush of warmth flooded her chest.

"Mommy, how was your day? I missed you tons!" Abigail chirped, her grape-like eyes sparkling.

The homemade contraption in her small hands looked suspiciously like a telephone. She pressed one end against the tablet screen while holding the other to her ear. "This is super secret, Mommy. Evelyn can't hear us now."

Vivian couldn't help grinning at her daughter's antics. Playing along, she whispered, "Did my big girl stay dry today? No accidents?"

Abigail's apple-round cheeks flushed crimson. "Mommy! I'm not a baby anymore! Only Adrian still does that!"

"Oops, my mistake," Vivian chuckled. "You just like taking your sweet time getting dressed now."

"Come home and I'll be super fast! Both me and Adrian miss you soooo much." Abigail's lower lip trembled dramatically.

"Soon, sweetheart. Everything's going perfectly here." Vivian crossed her fingers behind her back.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, but Vivian noticed someone missing. "Where's your brother? Doesn't he want to see Mommy?"

Abigail blinked rapidly. "Adrian's still mad. He said no talking until you come home!"

"That serious? Can you ask him to come say hi?"

"Nope!" Abigail shook her head firmly. "He's doing experiments like you! Making something super special to show you. He built this phone for me - isn't he the best?"

Vivian sighed. The apple didn't fall far from the tree.

Her son shared her relentless curiosity and knack for invention. Once immersed in his makeshift lab, days could pass unnoticed. That brilliant, stubborn mind would undoubtedly change the world someday.

"Alright then. Tell him Mommy loves him and isn't mad anymore, okay?"

"I'll fix him, Mommy!" Abigail promised with determination.

After ending the call, Vivian drifted into the most peaceful sleep she'd had in weeks.

Morning light found her already dressed and reviewing blueprints. Today's mission: inspect Lockhart Manor and finalize contracts with the restoration team.

Sophia insisted on accompanying her, citing safety concerns. They took Sophia's cherry-red Ferrari, sharing pastries between them like college roommates. The intimate gesture drew curious glances from passersby.

Sophia had been biting her tongue all morning. Finally, as they merged onto the highway, she blurted out, "Viv...you were serious about marrying Nathaniel, right?"

"Dead serious." Vivian met her gaze steadily. "That's not something I'd joke about."
###Chapter 397

"You don't actually like my brother, do you? He's always been your subordinate. No boss marries their subordinate."

"Marriage isn't about liking someone. It's about compatibility."

Vivian smiled bitterly. "Take me, for example. You know how deeply I loved a certain man before. And how did that end?"

"It's difficult for me to trust anyone, especially men. Liam has stood by me all these years—supporting me, protecting me, comforting me. He makes me feel safe. I truly believe no one in this world is more suited for me than him."

"The only reason you think he's suitable is because he suppresses his true nature for you... No, that's not quite right."

Sophia frowned, searching for the right words. "It's like he's dulled his edges just to please you. In reality, my brother is arrogant, ambitious, and dangerously capable. Otherwise, he wouldn't be infamous as the 'Demon Prince' of Newport City. He's not the harmless lapdog he pretends to be around you."

"I know."

Vivian's voice was steady. "Your family operates in the shadows. Without skill and ruthlessness, how could he control that world? As Theodore Osborne's favored heir, Liam will inherit the Osborne empire. Of course he's no harmless lapdog."

"If you know that, then don't play with his feelings—"

Sophia rarely spoke so seriously. She gripped Vivian's arm. "My brother's love for you is real. He may act carefree, like nothing affects him... but he's fiercely loyal. When he loves, he loves for life. If you're not certain about him, don't give him hope. I'm terrified he'll spend the rest of his days trying to forget you."

Though Liam and Sophia bickered constantly, as twins, they understood each other better than anyone.

No one knew the depth of Liam's love for Vivian like Sophia did.

And no one could say for sure whether Vivian had truly moved on from Nathaniel.

If Vivian got entangled with Nathaniel again, her brother would be destroyed.

"Don't worry. I understand your concerns. What you fear won't happen."

Vivian's resolve was unshakable. "Liam may not be my soulmate, but he's the man I choose to spend my life with. What we have transcends ordinary romance."

"That's... reassuring. Maybe I'm overreacting."

Sophia nodded, though unease still coiled in her chest.

Despite Vivian's assurances, she couldn't shake the feeling that something would go terribly wrong.

They arrived at Lockhart Manor.

Rumors of hauntings surrounded the estate, and after the devastating fire, the surrounding residents had fled. The once-prestigious neighborhood had become a desolate wasteland of overgrown weeds.

From a distance, the scorched ruins looked bleak and abandoned, still cordoned off with caution tape.

"Look what's become of my family home."

Vivian's expression darkened as she took in the destruction.

This house held generations of Lockhart memories. It meant everything to her.

Seeing it reduced to ruins felt like having her heart ripped out and trampled.

"After the fire, this area became Harborview City's forbidden zone. It's been abandoned for years—rebuilding would be nearly impossible. You'd be better off buying a new property..."

Sophia sighed, regret heavy in her voice.

Once the most elite address in the city, now a ghostly ruin. Life was unpredictable.

"A house is just a structure. A home is irreplaceable. I will rebuild Lockhart Manor, no matter the cost."

Beyond handling Azure Group affairs, restoring her family estate was Vivian's primary reason for returning to Newport City.

They lifted the caution tape, preparing to step inside.

Suddenly, a voice shouted, "Stop! This is private property!"
###Chapter 398

"Private property?"

Vivian narrowed her eyes at the uniformed guard blocking their path.

The man stood firm, his posture rigid with authority. "That's right. No unauthorized entry permitted."

Sophia's temper flared instantly. "Are you deaf? This is my best friend's family home! Since when did it become private property?"

She stepped forward aggressively, fists clenched. With Vivian's combat skills backing her up, Sophia feared no security guard.

"Try me." The guard unclipped his radio. "But I'm calling backup either way." He spoke into the device, "Code 7 at the Lockhart perimeter. Requesting immediate support."

Vivian placed a restraining hand on Sophia's arm. "Let's handle this civilly." Turning to the guard, she kept her tone polite but firm. "I'm Isabella Lockhart. This estate belongs to my family. Care to explain why I'm being barred from my own home?"

Recognition flickered in the guard's eyes. "Ah, you're the owner we couldn't contact." His stance relaxed slightly. "This area's been marked for municipal development - a waste management facility. Construction begins next month. You'll need to sign the expropriation papers."

"A garbage plant? Here?" Vivian's voice turned icy. "This is a historic residential district. Who authorized this?"

"City planners," the guard recited confidently. "With the northern expansion initiative, this land lost value. Perfect for infrastructure projects."

Sophia made a disgusted noise. "So you're telling us you'll bulldoze a house full of memories to build a trash dump?"

"Correct." The guard nodded. "Sign now and you'll still get compensation. Refuse..." He shrugged. "We'll have to treat it as an illegal structure."

Vivian's jaw tightened. "Is that so?"

"Municipal orders outweigh homeowner rights." The guard tapped his badge meaningfully. "No exceptions."

"I see." Vivian's smile didn't reach her eyes.
###Chapter 399

Vivian shook her head firmly. "I'm not going inside today."

Sophia's eyes widened in disbelief. She grabbed Vivian's arm tightly. "You're just walking away? This manor means everything to you! They're turning it into a waste processing plant! Doesn't that make your blood boil? How can you stay so calm?"

Vivian inhaled sharply, her expression turning grave. "Of course it infuriates me. But arguing with security won't solve anything. He's just following orders."

"Then what's your plan?" Sophia pressed.

"I need to find the real puppet master behind this land grab and make them back off."

"The puppet master?" Sophia frowned. "The guard said it's a municipal planning decision. A government project. Who else could be pulling strings?"

Vivian's gaze turned sharp. "On paper, yes. But some corporation is definitely driving this. To stop it, we have to confront the business interests manipulating things behind the scenes."

A chill ran down Sophia's spine at Vivian's intense look.

Her instincts screamed warning bells. Whatever shadowy figure was orchestrating this had specifically targeted Vivian - and wouldn't be easily defeated.

Back at Sunrise Heights apartment, Sophia left for a date with her new boyfriend William, leaving Vivian alone.

Vivian booted up her laptop, fingers flying as she researched the Lockhart Manor district's recent history.

The area had been marked for expropriation six months prior. The official reasoning cited numerous disturbing incidents - Vivian's parents' tragic deaths, alleged hauntings, and the devastating fire.

After the manor burned, the arsonists - the couple whose daughter died mysteriously at Nathan Prescott's club - had hanged themselves on the property. Their wrongful death lawsuit had been crushed by Julian Montgomery's legal team.

Now the neighborhood was infamous. Residents fled, leaving the area abandoned for years.

Six months ago, Harborview City announced plans for a new waste facility. Public surveys supposedly showed overwhelming support for locating it in this "cursed" district.

On the surface, it seemed legitimate. Objecting would make Vivian appear selfish, fighting progress. She'd lose both the property and public sympathy.

But Vivian saw through the facade. This was all about money and power plays.

Her investigation revealed the true architect: Dominic Pascal of the elite Pascal family.

The Pascals were among Newport City's most secretive elite clans. Few knew their true influence, but rumors swirled about Dominic - a middle-aged man obsessed with youth, allegedly using young women in bizarre rituals to maintain his vitality.

Vivian's brow furrowed. She'd never crossed paths with Dominic Pascal. Why would he orchestrate this elaborate scheme against her?

But motives didn't matter. One thing was certain - no one would take Lockhart Manor from her.

Just as Vivian located Dominic's private number, her phone buzzed. Her cousin Emily's excited voice burst through:

"Viv! Where are you? The main donor just arrived! Oh my god, he's so gorgeous I might faint! Get over here now!"
###Chapter 400

"Seriously?"

Vivian's curiosity ignited instantly.

While investigating Dominic Pascal earlier, she'd casually traced the top donor's IP address. The location pinged back to Blackwood Group headquarters. The mastermind behind the account was obvious.

The thought of Nathaniel Blackwood - that perpetually arrogant CEO - simping so hard just to see her shattered his icy reputation completely. She couldn't wait to tease him about it.

"Tell him to wait. I'm on my way."

Vivian powered down her computer, stretched her arms with a satisfied sigh, and headed for Skyview Restaurant.

"Viv! Over here!"

Emily waved excitedly from the entrance. Having achieved financial freedom from a single viral livestream, she'd splurged on booking the entire Skyview for the evening - no small feat for Newport City's most exclusive dining establishment.

Vivian stepped out of her car, the evening breeze catching her loose curls. She'd pinned them to one side with a diamond-encrusted hairpin today. Her Klein blue chiffon blouse paired with white wide-leg trousers and silver stilettos gave her an effortlessly elegant silhouette that turned heads.

"Damn, Viv! Looking like you walked straight off a Milan runway today." Emily whistled appreciatively, almost hesitant to approach her radiant friend.

"Flattery will get you everywhere," Vivian laughed, linking arms with Emily. "How long has Nathaniel been waiting? This sudden generosity feels suspicious."

"Mr. Blackwood?" Emily blinked in confusion. "Oh no, it's not him."

"Not him?"

"Nope. Some other ridiculously handsome guy - way more approachable than Mr. Ice King over there. Though..." Emily tapped her chin thoughtfully, "he's got this wild, untamed vibe that screams 'fun fling' rather than 'marriage material'."

At her age, Emily had zero immunity to good looks. Nathaniel had always topped her personal ranking... until tonight. Still, she remained pragmatic. "Definitely boyfriend material, but if we're talking long-term? Mr. Blackwood wins hands down."

"If you applied this analytical skills to your studies, your dad would throw a parade." Vivian pinched Emily's cheeks affectionately.

Learning it wasn't Nathaniel barely fazed her - if anything, it deepened the mystery.

Skyview Restaurant's claim to fame was its location atop the 336-meter Newport Tower. The fifteen-minute elevator ride to the 520-meter-high dining room offered panoramic views of the city below.

Locals called it the "Tower of True Love." Legend claimed soulmates would inevitably cross paths here.

The glass elevator walls revealed the glittering cityscape as they ascended.

"Viv, you know they say if you miss someone desperately, you'll see them here?" Emily sighed dramatically. "Isn't that the most romantic thing ever?"
###Chapter 401

Emily leaned against the elevator wall, her eyes sparkling as she took in the dazzling city lights below.

Vivian couldn't help but chuckle at her cousin's romantic notions. "So if I miss a billionaire badly enough, will an elevator full of gold bars appear?"

"Viv!" Emily pouted. "You're impossible. If you don't believe in fate, how will you ever find your soulmate?"

"Listen, kid," Vivian said, her tone turning serious. "Love won't pay your bills. Money keeps you safe. Love? That just gives people a weapon to hurt you with."

The words were harsh, but necessary. Better Emily learned this truth now than after heartbreak.

Emily shook her head stubbornly. "You're wrong. Real love heals. The only reason you're so cynical is because you got burned before. You act tough, but you're just scared to try again."

Vivian blinked.

Damn. When did teenagers get so perceptive?

The elevator doors slid open, revealing an opulent restaurant bathed in soft candlelight. A violinist played near floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city.

"Your mystery bidder's waiting," Emily whispered excitedly. "This is your romantic moment—I'm not crashing it!" Before Vivian could protest, the elevator doors closed behind her.

"Our honored guest," a waiter murmured, bowing deeply. "Right this way."

Near the windows stood a tall figure silhouetted against the skyline. The impeccably tailored suit accentuated his broad shoulders, the cut screaming expensive. He carried himself like royalty—the kind of man who turned heads without trying.

Vivian's pulse quickened as she approached. "Hello."

The man turned slowly, revealing a face that belonged on a magazine cover. A smirk played on his lips. "Miss me, gorgeous?"

Vivian nearly tripped.

In those few steps, she'd imagined a dozen possibilities—even wondered if it might be Nathaniel—but never him.

"You look disappointed," Julian teased, his voice rich with amusement.

Four years. Four years of digital cat-and-mouse, of firewalls breached and rebuilt. When he'd heard she was back, he'd seized the chance to outbid Nathaniel in that auction—letting his rival waste millions while he claimed the prize.

"Julian," Vivian breathed. "What happened to you?"

The Julian she remembered wore all black, a hacker lurking in shadows. This man? This was a predator in a designer suit.

He stepped closer, his dark eyes burning with intensity. "That's all you have to say after four years?"
###Chapter 402

"Stop!"

Vivian extended her arm, creating a barrier between them with a wry smile. "Personal space, Julian. We're just friends. Let's keep it appropriate."

"Friendship is your definition, not mine..."

A roguish grin spread across Julian's handsome, rebellious face. Instead of backing off, he seized Vivian's wrist, attempting to pull her closer—only to regret it instantly.

With practiced ease, Vivian twisted his arm behind his back. Despite his towering height, she had him completely subdued.

"Still playing games, Blackthorn? You really think you can outmaneuver me?"

She increased the pressure, determined to teach him a lesson.

Julian's arm throbbed in protest. Sweat beaded on his forehead, yet his grin never faltered. "What crime did I commit? Loving you? You vanished for four years. Four years of missing you—is that illegal?"

"You—!"

Heat flooded Vivian's cheeks.

She couldn't believe how shameless he'd become. His flirtatious charm had only intensified over the years—no, scratch that. He'd always been this bold.

Compared to Nathaniel's icy reserve—a man who'd probably never uttered a romantic word in his life—Julian was fire and passion personified.

If he loved you tenfold, he'd shout it from the rooftops a hundred times over.

Nathaniel? If he loved you tenfold, he'd bury it under layers of indifference.

Men. Polar opposites.

"Seems you're volunteering for a broken arm, Julian Blackthorn. Let me oblige."

Desperate to hide how his words affected her, Vivian doubled down on the force.

Julian's breath hitched, pain glazing his eyes, yet his smirk remained. "Go ahead. Cripple me. Then you'll have to take responsibility for life."

"Ugh!"

She released him instantly. "You're insufferable. Worse than a slick salesman. Fine, you win."

Julian flexed his nearly dislocated arm, wincing. "Damn. Falling for a warrior queen means I need combat training just to survive your affection."

Vivian rolled her eyes, refusing to dignify that with a response.

She scanned their absurdly romantic setting—roses, candlelight, a private fireworks display—before claiming a seat by the window. Julian settled opposite her with effortless grace.

As waiters delivered their steak and wine, Vivian finally cut to the chase. "So. You're the runner-up who swindled Nathaniel out of four million last night. Why you?"

"Swindled?" Julian swirled his wineglass, amused. "I donated nearly the same amount, darling. Disappointed it's me here instead of him?"

"Surprised, not disappointed," she admitted bluntly.

His grin turned wolfish. "Simple. The top bidder declined. As second-highest, I stepped in."

"How'd you know he wouldn't come?"

"Please." Julian's eyes glinted with hacker's pride. "We both know Blackwood Group's firewalls are child's play. His schedule showed he'd be... otherwise occupied tonight."

Vivian scoffed. "Still cutting corners on cybersecurity, I see."

"Curious about his plans?" Julian leaned in, voice dropping. "Might ruin your mood."

She met his gaze unflinchingly. "If Nathaniel Blackwood could still affect me, I wouldn't be here. I'm over him."

Julian's smile turned triumphant. "Perfect. That means my chances just skyrocketed."
###Chapter 403

Julian Blackthorn's striking features lit up with unrestrained joy.

If Vivian Lockhart had truly moved on from Nathaniel Blackwood, he was certain his genuine devotion would eventually win her heart.

"You don't stand a chance. Once I wrap up my business here, I'm getting married."

Vivian sliced through her steak with calm precision.

Julian's expression darkened instantly. "Married? To whom?"

"That's none of your concern."

His initial panic faded as confidence took over. "Whoever he is—as long as he isn't a Blackwood, and as long as you're not already his—I'll make you love me."

"Confidence is admirable when applied correctly."

Vivian locked eyes with him. "Now, tell me Nathaniel Blackwood's schedule for tonight."

"Still obsessed with him, I see—"

Julian exhaled, relenting. "His calendar shows a candlelit dinner, just like yours."

"Oh?"

Interest sparked in Vivian's gaze. "With who?"

"Cassandra Delacroix. While you were gone, they grew... close. Rumor says wedding bells might ring soon."

"Perfect!"

Genuine delight flashed across Vivian's face.

If Nathaniel married Cassandra, he'd lose all interest in her children.

Cassandra wasn't the nurturing type. She'd never tolerate stepchildren.

"Let them marry quickly. Nothing would bring me more peace."

Vivian practically glowed as she savored her meal.

Julian studied her skeptically. "This isn't an act?"

"Do I look like I'm acting?"

Her happiness was too palpable to fake.

"After you and Nathaniel left four years ago, my family made my life hell." Julian's voice turned bitter. "Grandfather, father, mother—all berated me for failing to win you. When they heard you'd returned? They celebrated like I'd been handed a second chance. Their orders were clear: claim you, whatever the cost."

"What exactly is the Baldwin family offering?"

Vivian smirked.

"Nothing extravagant. Just unlimited funds."

"I don't need money right now."

"Don't refuse yet." Julian clinked his glass against hers. "Lockhart Enterprises is planning something big. You'll need capital. The Baldwins have relocated assets to Newport City. I anticipate our... fruitful collaboration."

Vivian frowned.

Julian never made empty promises. Whatever game he was playing, the pieces were already in motion.

After dinner, they descended via elevator.

Night had deepened, painting the city in glittering lights.

As the elevator descended, Vivian recalled Mandy's ridiculous legend—that soulmates would reunite here.

Childish nonsense.

She chuckled—then froze.

In the ascending elevator opposite them stood Nathaniel Blackwood, hands in pockets, his icy gaze locking onto hers.
###Chapter 404

Their meeting lasted only a heartbeat. Like two comets crossing paths in the night sky.

One ascending, one descending. Neither pausing for the other.

"Seems Mr. Top Bidder still remembers you. He actually showed up for dinner." Julian Blackthorn smirked as they reached the lobby.

Vivian Lockhart adjusted her designer sunglasses. "His schedule means nothing to me."

She strode toward the parking lot without looking back, her stilettos clicking against marble.

"Aren't you going to talk to him?"

"Our reservation was eight to eleven. It's eleven-fifteen now." Vivian pressed her car key fob. "His tardiness doesn't obligate me to wait."

Her tone held the finality of a judge's gavel.

"True. Probably here to wine and dine Cassandra Delacroix." Julian shoved hands in his pockets, glancing up at the skyscraper. "Explains why he looked straight through you like a stranger."

Vivian slid into her crimson Ferrari without responding.

"Late. Going home. See you around." She gave a perfunctory wave, face unreadable behind tinted windows.

"I'll hold you to that next time." Julian's smile didn't reach his eyes.

Four years of waiting for fifteen minutes. The math left him unsatisfied.

Still, compared to Nathaniel Blackwood's three-second glimpse, he'd gotten the better deal.

The Ferrari's engine roared to life, tires screeching as Vivian vanished into the night. No hesitation. No rearview mirror glances. Just like her—once a decision was made, no second thoughts.

Meanwhile, fifty-two floors above, Nathaniel stood before floor-to-ceiling windows, ice swirling in his untouched Scotch.

That fleeting moment in the elevator haunted him.

He'd seen footage of her return. But nothing prepared him for her scent—bergamot and vanilla—filling the enclosed space.

His traitorous pulse had spiked when their eyes met.

And hers? Surely she'd felt it too. Probably worse. Maybe her knees had gone weak beneath that power suit.

Nathaniel adjusted his tie, mentally rehearsing lines while watching the elevator doors.

"Don't flatter yourself. I was in the neighborhood." Too casual.

"Four million buys surprisingly bland steak." Would reveal his anonymous bid.

"Newport City missed you." Sounded bitter.

Minutes ticked by. The elevator remained still.

"Playing hard to get?" Nathaniel's knuckles whitened around his glass.

The restaurant stood empty save for staff.

He checked his Patek Philippe. "Ten more minutes."

The manager approached cautiously when time elapsed.

"Mr. Blackwood..."
###Chapter 405

Nathaniel Blackwood's chiseled features hardened as he spoke through gritted teeth. "She's finally here?"

The manager blinked in confusion. "Excuse me, sir?"

"Who else would I be referring to?"

"I... I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwood. I don't follow—"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his patience fraying. "If you don't know who I'm talking about, why are you wasting my time?"

The manager swallowed nervously. "I only meant to inform you that we're closing for the night."

In truth, the restaurant should have shut its doors thirty minutes ago.

But Nathaniel Blackwood had been standing motionless by the window, his presence so commanding that no one dared approach him—until now.

"Are you expecting someone?" the manager ventured cautiously. "We could contact them for you."

"Unnecessary."

Nathaniel's voice was ice.

The realization burned through him—Vivian Lockhart had the audacity to ignore him.

In his thirty years of life, few things had ever eluded him.

Every exception? Because of her.

His grip on the windowsill tightened.

Fine. If she refuses to acknowledge me, I'll make her come crawling back.

With that resolve, he strode out of the restaurant, the night air biting against his skin.

Streetlights flickered weakly over the deserted pavement. The occasional car roared past, stirring the cold wind.

Nathaniel moved toward the parking lot, his steps sharp with purpose.

A sudden honk shattered the silence.

He turned.

There she was.

Vivian Lockhart leaned against a sleek red convertible, her silhouette bathed in the dim glow of the city.

Her lips curved into that infuriatingly confident smirk.

"Long time no see, Mr. Blackwood."

His pulse spiked—wild, untamed—but his expression remained unreadable.

"Long time no see?" He closed the distance between them, each step deliberate. "That's all you have to say after vanishing for four years?"

Vivian didn’t flinch. She met his gaze head-on, amusement dancing in her eyes. "What else is there to say?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, forcing his fingers to unclench. "I thought you left with Julian Blackwood. What brought you back?"

She tilted her head. "I thought you had somewhere else to be. Yet here you are."

The ease in her voice grated on him. She wasn’t pretending—she was genuinely unbothered.

And that infuriated him more than anything.

"Enough games, Vivian."

His control snapped.

In one swift motion, he seized her shoulders and pulled her against him—close enough to feel her breath hitch, close enough to remind her who owned this moment.
###Chapter 406

Ethan's voice was rough with barely contained fury. His lips brushed against Vivian's ear as he spoke, each word dripping with pain. "Vivian Lockhart, you're the coldest woman I've ever known."

Four years of suppressed emotions erupted like a volcano, impossible to contain.

His arms locked around her with crushing force, as if he could fuse their bodies together. As if that were the only way to keep her from vanishing again.

The embrace was suffocating, bordering on painful. Vivian winced but didn't pull away.

She could have thrown him across the room effortlessly. Yet she stayed still, pliant in his arms like a docile creature.

This was the embrace she'd once ached for—fierce, possessive, burning with intensity. But now? It left her hollow.

Love could ignite in an instant. Letting go took longer, but four years had been enough. She'd moved on.

When Ethan finally released her, his reluctance was palpable. He didn't step back, keeping her within reach.

"Don't read into that," he muttered. "It meant nothing."

Vivian nodded. "Of course."

Her calm indifference infuriated him. It was like punching a cloud—all force, no impact.

He controlled empires with a word. Yet this woman had always eluded him, past and present. The frustration was maddening.

"If you hate me so much, why didn't you fight back?" he demanded. "You're more than capable."

Vivian shrugged. "You misunderstand, Mr. Blackwood. I don't hate you. We were married once. A reunion hug seems... polite."

"How gracious." His laugh was bitter. "I never took you for someone so detached, Miss Lockhart. Did you really think four years in hiding would erase what you did?"

She knew this confrontation was inevitable. "Then what do you want from me?"

"Do you have any idea what you cost Cassandra?" Pain flickered across his face. "She lost her child because of you. Her womb had to be removed. She'll never be a mother."

Guilt had eaten at him for years. His brother's bloodline, severed. A woman's life, destroyed. He'd buried the grief in work, punishing himself daily.

Now Vivian stood before him—the catalyst of it all. It was time to settle this.

"Intentional or not, that child died by your hand. Cassandra attempted suicide multiple times. You owe her an apology."

Vivian's composure faltered. "It's that bad?"

She hadn't anticipated such lasting damage. The old Vivian would never have apologized to someone like Cassandra Delacroix.

But motherhood had changed her. She understood that kind of loss now.

"I'll handle it," she said coolly. After a beat, she added, "But this is between Cassandra and me. Stay out of it. If you get hurt interfering, that's on you."

Ethan hadn't expected such easy compliance. Beneath the anger, something ached—sharp and unnameable.
###Chapter 407

This seemed to be the last thread tying them together.

If this matter was resolved cleanly, there would be nothing left between them. They would become complete strangers.

"Good. I have nothing more to say."

Nathaniel's emotions were tangled, just like his feelings for Vivian.

He couldn't claim to hate her.

But there was no reason left to hold her close again.

Four years had changed too much.

Nathaniel turned away sharply, ready to leave.

"Wait."

Vivian's voice stopped him.

"Something else?"

"Thank you."

Her words were sincere.

"For what?"

He frowned.

"For visiting my parents' graves these past four years. I loved you deeply once. I hated you just as much. But now, it's over. No love. No hate. Next time we meet, I hope we can smile at each other. I hope we both live well."

She spoke from the heart, a soft smile on her lips.

Before, she had carried too much weight. Only now did she realize how light life could be when she let go.

Her words were meant to be freeing, but Nathaniel's expression darkened.

She was that eager to sever their ties?

"I think this amber pendant is yours. I found it four years ago. It's time I returned it."

Vivian removed the pendant from her neck—the one she'd kept for years—and handed it to him.

"You had it?"

Nathaniel snatched it from her fingers. The amber still carried the warmth of her skin.

After a careful inspection, he confirmed it was the pendant his brother had left behind. Emotion flickered in his eyes. "This is important to me. I've searched for it for years."

"You dropped it at my parents' graves. I never expected you to go there, so I didn't realize it was yours. Sorry for the trouble."

Her tone was polite. Distant.

Nathaniel despised that politeness.

They had been intimate once. Now she treated him like a stranger.

But a man like Nathaniel Blackwood would never let his frustration show.

"Pray it isn't damaged. An apology won't be enough if it is."

With that icy remark, he walked away without looking back.

Vivian leaned against her car, watching Nathaniel's imposing figure disappear into the night. A faint smile touched her lips.

Tsk. Still the same arrogant attitude. Maybe it's time life taught him a lesson.
###Chapter 408

Vivian stepped into the apartment well past midnight.

Sophia still hadn't returned. Unusual for her.

"Did that commitment-phobe actually meet someone special?"

As the thought crossed Vivian's mind, the door creaked open. Sophia tiptoed inside, cheeks flushed pink, eyes sparkling with uncharacteristic softness.

Ahem

Vivian blocked her path, arms crossed. "Care to explain? Where were you? And why so late?"

Sophia bit her lip before blurting out, "Okay, truth time. I'm head over heels. If everything goes smoothly, we're getting married by month's end. Maybe even a double wedding if timing works out!"

"Already?" Vivian's brows shot up. "Isn't this moving too fast?"

Though happy for her friend, unease prickled Vivian's skin. "You swore off marriage and kids forever. What changed?"

"Because I never met someone like him!" Sophia's voice trembled with excitement. "When it's right, all your rules shatter. Nothing else matters."

This from the woman who once mocked romance, preferring celebrity gossip over real relationships.

One taste of love had turned her world upside down.

Vivian didn't press further. "At least introduce me before you walk down the aisle. Dinner tomorrow?"

"Already planned it!" Sophia beamed. "You'll love him."

Vivian nodded.

"So?" Sophia's eyes gleamed. "How was your dinner with the mystery donor? Let me guess—Nathaniel Blackwood?"

"Unfortunately, yes."

No point denying it.

Sophia gasped dramatically. "Oh no, the sparks flew again, didn't they? Poor Dominic. His days are numbered."

Her imagination was already writing breakup scenarios. She'd always sensed unfinished business between Vivian and Nathaniel. Dominic never stood a chance.

Vivian's expression hardened. "Don't. If sparks existed, they'd have ignited years ago. We just settled old debts."

"Good." Sophia sighed in relief. "Old flames are like tumors—cut them out clean or they'll poison you."

Then hesitation flickered across her face. "But...the twins. Can you ever truly be free of him?"

Blackwood Estate

Four years of Vivian's absence had taken its toll on Alfred Blackwood's health. Worry aged him prematurely.

Nathaniel moved back to care for his grandfather, trading penthouse views for family duty.

Tonight, he returned unusually early. Assuming Alfred slept, he headed straight for the study—work never waited.
###Chapter 409

The study loomed large and shadowy, its towering bookshelves swallowing what little light seeped through the heavy drapes.

Ethan flicked the switch, the sudden brightness revealing Alfred Blackwood perched stiffly on the leather sofa. The sight made him jerk backward, his pulse spiking.

"Grandfather, what are you doing lurking in the dark at this hour?"

Alfred's knuckles whitened around his cane. "Maybe I want to give myself a heart attack. At least then I wouldn't have to watch my grandchildren bumble through life like headless chickens."

"Not this again—"

Rubbing his temples, Ethan schooled his expression and crouched before the old man. "Did something upset you today?"

"Nothing beyond the usual disappointment." Alfred's milky eyes glazed with bitterness. "These useless old eyes can't even recognize faces anymore. Pathetic, for a man who once led battalions."

The grandfather clock ticked loudly as memories of Alpine Springs' liberation flashed through Alfred's mind—how sharply he'd once seen the world, how firmly he'd commanded respect. Now? A trembling relic.

With surprising dexterity, Alfred produced his smartphone. "My vision's shot. Nathaniel, tell me—who's this woman in the video? Her form is impeccable."

Ethan leaned in.

Vivian Lockhart's viral sparring footage filled the screen.

His jaw tightened. "Some internet celebrity, probably. All staged for clicks. You know how these influencers are." He reached for the phone. "Let's find you something better to—"

"Enough!" Alfred smacked his cane against Ethan's shin. "Open your damn eyes, boy. That's Isabella! When were you planning to tell me she's back in Newport?"

Ethan feigned confusion. "Oh! You're right—that's Cassandra Whitmore. Nathan Prescott's been pushing her as the new face of—"

"Liar!" Alfred's shout rattled the crystal decanters. "I watched her livestream! Donated fifty thousand myself! Unlike some idiot who blew four million trying to be subtle."

Ethan's ears burned. Since when did his tech-illiterate grandfather stalk social media?

"I want her here for dinner." Alfred's gnarled fingers tightened on the cane. "Tomorrow."

Ethan scoffed. "Good luck. She's booked solid these days. Maybe if you ask nicely..."

Let the old man humiliate himself for once. After the way Vivian had severed ties, Ethan refused to grovel.

"Fine." Alfred's rheumy eyes gleamed with sudden cunning. "I'll handle it myself."

The grandfather clock struck midnight as schemes began unfolding behind those aged irises.
###Chapter 410

The following afternoon.

Vivian and Sophia arrived at an upscale seafood bistro overlooking the harbor.

"Vivian, look—that's my boyfriend, William Carter. Isn't he dreamy?"

Sophia gestured toward a well-dressed man waiting in the reserved section, his fingers drumming lightly against the tablecloth. He kept adjusting his tie, clearly nervous about the meeting.

Vivian studied him. "He seems... sweet. Not what I expected from someone who caught your eye."

She'd always assumed Sophia would go for the brooding, powerful type—given her obsession with those dark, intense actors.

But gentle had its perks. At least this one looked like he'd remember anniversaries. Assuming, of course, he wasn't hiding fangs beneath that polished smile.

William spotted them. His face lit up as he waved them over.

"Sophia!"

He immediately took her bag, then laced their fingers together. "You must be starving. I ordered the coconut crab—your favorite."

Sophia beamed. "This is my best friend, Vivian. Closer than a sister, honestly. She's brilliant—runs a company, hacks systems for fun, graduated top of her class at—"

Ahem.

Vivian cut her off with a sharp smile. "Vivian Lockhart. Nice to meet you."

"William Carter." He adjusted his glasses, returning the smile.

Dinner passed smoothly. William peeled shrimp for Sophia, refilled their glasses without being asked, and maintained just the right amount of polite distance from Vivian.

According to Sophia, he was third-generation American—father a surgeon, mother a literature professor. A philosophy major at Columbia. Impeccable pedigree, flawless manners.

Too flawless.

Vivian swirled her wine. "Sophia mentioned you're getting married this month. Isn't that fast? You've only known each other three months."

William didn't blink. "When it's right, time doesn't matter. We knew by the third day." He squeezed Sophia's hand. "She's it for me. I'd marry her tomorrow if I could."

The way they gazed at each other—saccharine enough to rot teeth.

"Remember this moment," Vivian said coolly. She clinked her glass against his. "Because if you hurt her, I'll make sure you regret it."

She downed the wine in one go.

Her own love life was a disaster. Sophia's wouldn't be.

After dinner, Vivian made an excuse to leave. She wandered the mall, then pulled out her phone.

"Kevin. Long time. I need a favor—run a background check for me."

Kevin Reynolds—her old lab partner from Stanford. If anyone could dig up skeletons, it was him.
###Chapter 411

Kevin Reynolds had an extensive network in Newport City. His outgoing personality granted him access to privileged information. Tracing someone's family history was effortless for him, regardless of their social standing.

"William Carter? Absolutely!" Kevin's voice crackled with excitement through the phone. "Give me ten minutes. I'll compile his entire dossier for you."

"Much appreciated. I'll wait." Vivian Lockhart ended the call, her brow furrowing.

Though she'd initially approved of William, lingering doubts gnawed at her. The man's apparent flawlessness only heightened her suspicions. She needed a thorough background check!

While waiting, Vivian headed to the children's department on the third floor. Shopping for her twins had become her greatest joy since their birth. Today, she sought adorable new outfits for her little ones.

"This one...and this...oh, definitely this!" Vivian swiftly selected six ensembles, instructing the sales associate to wrap them. The employee scrambled to accommodate the substantial order.

As Vivian turned to leave, she collided with Nathaniel Blackwood and Cassandra Delacroix.

Her stomach dropped. 'Just my luck...'

Cassandra leaned weakly against Nathaniel, tears glistening in her eyes. But upon spotting Vivian, her demeanor transformed instantly. With wild eyes, she launched forward, fingers clawing at Vivian's throat like a woman possessed.

"Fate smiles on me today - my son's death anniversary!" Cassandra shrieked. "I'll avenge him by killing you!"

Caught off-balance with arms full of packages, Vivian stood defenseless.

"Cassandra! Release her!" Nathaniel barked, attempting to intervene.

But Cassandra's hysteria granted her unnatural strength. Despite her frail physique, she maintained a viselike grip on Vivian's neck, making separation difficult.

"You murdered my child! You stole my motherhood!" Cassandra's nails drew blood as Vivian's face reddened, gasping for air.

Abruptly, the pressure vanished. Vivian gulped oxygen, turning to see Cassandra limp in Nathaniel's arms.

"She fainted on her own! Don't you dare blame me," Vivian rasped, massaging her bruised throat while backing away. "Why isn't she moving? Tell me she's still breathing..."
###Chapter 412

"You're awfully quick to wish her dead." Nathaniel shot Cassandra a dark glare, cradling Vivian protectively in his arms before gently laying her down on a nearby bench.

Cassandra had nearly met her end thanks to Vivian's sudden violent outburst. In that panicked moment, Nathaniel had no choice but to strike Vivian's pressure point, rendering her unconscious. Otherwise, Cassandra wouldn't have survived the attack.

Vivian would likely recover after some rest, so Nathaniel made no move to wake her. Instead, he turned his attention to Cassandra, who was still in the children's section, gathering the scattered clothes. His gaze sharpened as he picked up a tiny striped sock from the floor. "Why are you buying so many children's clothes?"

Cassandra barely spared him a glance as she continued packing. "Since when do you care? Am I not allowed to shop for cute things?"

The sock was soft, pink, and small enough to fit in his palm. He couldn't deny its charm—something about it made his chest tighten unexpectedly.

"You bought this… because it's cute?" he asked skeptically, holding it out to her.

Cassandra recoiled as if he'd handed her something contaminated. "I did think it was adorable. But now that you've touched it, I don’t want it anymore."

His jaw clenched. What the hell? She acts like I’m some kind of plague. One minute she’s all polite, the next she’s treating me like I’m beneath her.

"I just saved your life by knocking her out, and this is how you repay me?" He blocked her path, forcing her to meet his glare. "What did I do this time to deserve your attitude?"

Her eyes burned with fury. "Are you seriously playing dumb, Blackwood? Or are you just that oblivious? You and Delacroix—you’re cut from the same cloth. Since she’s part of your precious family now, she’s just as eager to choke the life out of people. You failed to break my neck four years ago, so she’s finishing the job for you. Stop pretending you’re anything but a monster."

Four years should have been enough to bury the past. But when Cassandra’s hands had closed around her throat, all Vivian could see was him—his grip had been stronger, his hatred more visceral. The memory of that near-death experience had never faded.

And now, it was all rushing back.

Nathaniel watched the fire in her eyes with perverse satisfaction. Finally. She’s not acting like some emotionless statue. She’s feeling something—because of me.

Even if it was hatred, it meant he still mattered. That realization sent a thrill through his cold, dead heart.

"You’re right. I’m not a good man." He seized her wrist and pressed her palm against his chest. "So hate me. Scream at me. Hit me if you want. But don’t you dare pretend you’re fine. I’d rather you fight me than act like I mean nothing to you."

He couldn’t stand her indifference. If rage was all she had left for him, he’d take it—gladly.
###Chapter 413

"Go ahead, hit me! Aren't you the fierce fighter? Make me bleed, or better yet—strangle me to death!" Nathaniel Blackwood challenged, grabbing Vivian Lockhart's wrist and pressing her palm against his throat. His intense gaze left no room for doubt—he meant every word.

"Have you lost your damn mind?" Vivian recoiled, fury dissolving into bewildered shock. She yanked her hand free, glaring. "There are surveillance cameras everywhere. Stop trying to frame me!"

"Then let them record me giving you permission. If you cripple or kill me, I'll take full responsibility."

"You're insane." Vivian finally wrenched herself away, putting distance between them as if he were contagious.

Typical Nathaniel Blackwood—actually begging to be beaten. This man is terrifying.

"I wronged you four years ago. Consider this your chance for payback." His voice turned icy, the momentary madness replaced by his usual arrogant detachment. "You refused. So drop the grudge—unless you want to ruin whatever's left between us."

Vivian scoffed. "Between us? There is nothing between us, Nathaniel. Nothing to ruin."

I swore I wouldn’t let him rattle me like this. Damn it.

His lips curled into a smirk. "Then let’s build something new. Even if it ends in hatred, it’ll be worth it."

Her throat tightened. "You need psychiatric help."

Just then, Cassandra Delacroix stirred awake. In a heartbeat, her demeanor shifted—she scrambled to her knees before Vivian, clutching her skirt. "Please, Miss Lockhart! I’ll never interfere again! Spare my baby and me—I’m begging you!"

Vivian stared, dumbfounded. What the hell is happening?

Nathaniel hauled Cassandra up, his tone clipped. "Did you skip your medication today?"

"I—I—"

"Damn it." He exhaled sharply, retrieving a pill bottle from his coat. "Take one. Now."

"But the baby—" Cassandra whimpered, shrinking back. "It’s too bitter, and the chemicals could harm—"

"Swallow it."

Trembling, she obeyed, tears streaming down her face.

Vivian watched, unease coiling in her chest. She edged closer to Nathaniel. "What’s wrong with her?"
###Chapter 414

Ethan made sure Cassandra took her pills before directing her to the lounge area nearby.

She didn't resist, moving like a ghost with empty eyes. She sank onto the couch, motionless, as if her soul had left her body.

Turning back to Vivian, his expression hardened. "How can you even ask me that? Do you really not understand why she's like this?"

Vivian's temper flared. "Stop speaking in riddles, Ethan Blackwood. If you think I'm some monster, then just take your revenge! Don't act like you're morally superior while punishing me."

His gaze darkened with sorrow. "Do you feel nothing for the life you destroyed? The woman you ruined? Do you honestly believe you shouldn't face consequences?"

Vivian's throat tightened. How could I not regret it? I've tortured myself over that night for four years. But I can't undo it—should I drown in guilt forever?

Ethan's voice cracked. "She was bleeding out when I got her to the hospital. The doctors said—if we'd been just minutes earlier, they could've saved the baby. They wouldn't have had to remove her uterus. Minutes, Vivian." His eyes burned with unshed tears.

"Why did you push her?" His whisper was raw. "I faked her death. Hid her where you'd never find her. Why couldn't you just walk away?"

Vivian looked away. She wanted to scream that Cassandra had sought her out, that the woman had provoked her mercilessly—but none of it mattered. She wasn't innocent.

"Just a little sooner," Ethan choked out. "That's all it would've taken. How could you stand there and watch? What were you so afraid of?"

Regret, not anger, lined his face.

"I'd already chosen you. If we'd been faster—none of this would've happened."

Back then, he'd just left the Baldwin estate with Vivian, finally understanding his own heart. He'd been waiting for her answer, hoping for a fresh start.

Then everything shattered.

We wouldn't be here if we'd just been faster.

"I'm sorry," Vivian whispered, bowing her head.

Ethan exhaled heavily. "After losing the baby, Cassandra lost her mind. The doctors diagnosed severe manic depression. She'll need medication for life—but the pills have side effects. Some days, she's lucid enough to remember the baby and her hysterectomy, and she sobs for hours. Other days, she still thinks she's pregnant. She drags me to doctor's appointments, buys baby clothes..."

His gaze flicked to the vacant woman on the couch. "She must've skipped her meds today. That's why she fixated on the baby's 'death anniversary.' Seeing you triggered her breakdown."

He met Vivian's eyes. "I'm not telling you this for revenge. I just want you to know—you're not the only one suffering. You hurt, but she's living in hell. How could I not grieve for her?"
###Chapter 415

Ethan's face twisted in anguish. Those memories were meant to stay buried, locked away where they couldn't haunt him anymore. He had vowed to spend the rest of his life atoning for his mistakes.

But Vivian was here now, standing before him, and no amount of denial could erase her from his heart.

"You said I hated you," he admitted, his voice rough. "And I did—for a while. But the truth is, I hated myself more. I was the one who failed us. I was too idealistic, too blind. I couldn't stop any of it from happening..." His words faltered, and he turned away, shoulders trembling as he fought to keep his composure.

Vivian had never seen him like this—raw, vulnerable. The man she knew was always cold, always in control. But now, he looked lost. The only other time she'd witnessed this side of him was at his brother's funeral.

Her chest ached. The urge to reach out, to comfort him, was almost overwhelming.

Then a sharp voice in her mind hissed, "Sympathize with him, and you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Don’t."

She swallowed hard and forced herself to speak lightly. "What's done is done. No use dwelling on it. Just... move on."

There was no magic phrase to erase years of pain.

"Is there anything you need from me?" she asked carefully.

Ethan drew a slow breath, regaining his composure. His expression smoothed into its usual indifference, though his eyes still glistened. "If you truly feel guilty, then show Cassandra some mercy. She’s not a saint, but she’s not evil either. Life hasn’t been kind to her."

'My brother loved her deeply,' he thought. 'If he were still alive, they would’ve had a happy family. But fate had other plans. And now, the least I can do is honor his memory by looking after her.'

"Understood," Vivian said with a nod.

'So he really does love her now,' she mused bitterly. 'Enough to stand by her, even after everything. How touching. No wonder he was so eager to divorce me back then.'

"We're visiting the child’s grave today," Ethan said, his tone icy. "You can come with us, if you’re free."

He knew this was something only she could resolve. Otherwise, they’d all remain trapped in this endless cycle of guilt and regret.

But he wasn’t sure she would agree. Not with her pride.

"Of course," he added, watching her closely, "if you’d rather not, I won’t force you."
###Chapter 416

"I'll go with you. The child was innocent in all this." Vivian made the decision to accompany Ethan and Cassandra to the cemetery.

Located on the western outskirts of Newport City, the burial ground was surrounded by dense woods. The isolation made the place feel unsettling, even in daylight.

Vivian sat in the backseat, watching the trees blur past through the window. Her expression was heavy. No matter what had happened between her and Cassandra, the child didn’t deserve to be caught in the crossfire.

She couldn’t escape the guilt.

The car was thick with tension, broken only by Cassandra’s quiet sobs. Despite her hatred for the woman, Vivian understood a mother’s grief.

She reached forward, offering a tissue.

Cassandra turned, her eyes red-rimmed. "Miss Lockhart, I’m not trying to manipulate you. The pain is real. And I’m terrified—"

"Please," Vivian cut in gently. "Just stop appearing in front of me and Ethan. Every time I see you, I remember that day. The fall. The blood."

"That’s enough." Ethan’s sharp tone silenced Cassandra. Clearly, he didn’t want Vivian pulling away because of her.

But Vivian only shrugged. "Don’t worry. I won’t interfere in your lives."

Since they were on the subject, she might as well offer a solution. "If you two plan to stay together, you’ll want children, right? When I was at Stanford, I knew a professor researching artificial wombs. I could ask if the procedure would work for you—"

She figured if they had their own child, Ethan wouldn’t fight for Adrian and Abigail. And maybe, just maybe, she could make amends.

"Really?" Cassandra’s dull eyes suddenly sparked. "You’d do that for us?"

"If it exists, tell me!" Cassandra clutched Ethan’s arm. "I just want to carry on the Blackwood bloodline. You’d support that, wouldn’t you, Ethan?"

Ethan’s grip on the wheel tightened. His silence spoke louder than words.

Vivian pressed on. "Mr. Blackwood, you’re not getting any younger. An heir would secure your legacy. And it might even strengthen your relationship with Miss Delacroix."

She leaned forward. "The procedure has had successful trials. It’s just not public yet. But I have connections. If you’re willing—"

"Enough!" Ethan slammed his palm against the horn. The blaring sound made both women jump.

His glare was icy as it met Vivian’s in the rearview mirror. "If you’re so eager to help, why not do something useful?"

Vivian blinked. "What do you mean?"

Ethan’s voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Instead of an artificial womb, why don’t you carry the child?"

Vivian choked. "Are you out of your mind, Blackwood? That’s not the same thing at all!"
###Chapter 417

"So, you finally understand! Then let me make my own decisions about having children—and with whom. Your interference isn't necessary!" Nathaniel Blackwood snapped, slamming the brakes.

Vivian Lockhart realized she had overstepped. Nathaniel was a man of pride, accustomed to control. Dictating something as personal as fatherhood would naturally provoke him.

"Fine, I apologize. I was too pushy." She exhaled sharply. "But my intentions were good. I only suggested the procedure for you and Miss Delacroix—"

"Get out." His voice was ice.

"What? We're not even there yet." She glanced at the dense woods outside, confused.

"Now." His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. Only sheer frustration could make him this rude.

"Fine!" Vivian shoved the door open. The suffocating tension in the car made walking to the cemetery seem preferable.

The tires screeched as Nathaniel sped away.

"Petty, much?" She scowled at the vanishing car. "I was trying to help solve their fertility issues. A little gratitude would’ve been nice, but no—he had to throw a tantrum. Ungrateful bastard."

The forest air was unnervingly cold for summer.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Kevin.

[Done. Full dossier sent to your email.]

Vivian opened the attachment immediately. A ten-page PDF detailed William Carter’s life: birth records, education, friendships.

The report confirmed his claims. He came from an academic family, was well-respected in his circles, and had no shady connections.

Except one glaring red flag.

Leia was his second girlfriend. His first? Cassandra Delacroix.

At twenty, William had fallen hard for Cassandra. Their relationship lasted three months before she dumped him. He’d begged, even threatened suicide. Afterward, he buried himself in studies, becoming a rising star set to inherit his father’s empire.

Past relationships were normal. But Cassandra’s involvement? That reeked of trouble.

Too engrossed, Vivian didn’t notice she’d strayed into dangerous territory.
###Chapter 418

The graveyard stood isolated in the wilderness. Dense thickets surrounded the perimeter, the narrow pathways littered with jagged stones.

A heavy mist clung to the air, distorting all sense of direction. One wrong turn, and the forest became an inescapable labyrinth—deadly for anyone unprepared.

Vivian Lockhart stared at her phone, debating whether to tell Sophia about William Carter's tangled history with Cassandra Delacroix. Then—

Her body lurched forward without warning.

A scream tore from her throat as she plummeted over the cliff's edge. Her skull struck rock mid-fall, and darkness swallowed her whole.

Meanwhile, Ethan Blackwood and Cassandra had already reached the child's grave. A small, weathered headstone bore the infant's name and date of passing.

"Hello, my darling," Cassandra murmured, kneeling before the plot. "Mommy and Uncle Ethan came to visit. Are you warm enough? I brought you new clothes." She placed several neatly folded garments on the damp earth.

Ethan's guilt had long since hardened into irritation. But given Cassandra's fragile mental state, he held his tongue—letting her cling to delusion.

Normally, an unborn child wouldn't merit a burial. Their culture considered such acts an omen of misfortune. But this was different. This was Sebastian Hunt's only heir—the last remnant of his bloodline.

Ethan had only agreed to the burial after Cassandra's relentless pleading. They'd encased the fetus in an ornate coffin, hiring a renowned shaman to inter it in this secluded plot.

As Cassandra continued whispering to the grave, Ethan's gaze flicked toward the cemetery entrance. His jaw tightened.

Where is she?

The path was straightforward—a mile-long walk at most. She should've arrived within twenty minutes. Yet over an hour had passed with no sign of Vivian.

"Ethan?" Cassandra finally rose, wiping her tears. "Should we keep waiting for Miss Lockhart?"

He checked his watch. "A little longer."

Thirty more minutes crawled by. Still nothing.

Cassandra's voice trembled. "Let's go. She's not coming." Fresh tears spilled over. "She feels no remorse for what she did. No guilt over my baby's death."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Why would she? In her eyes, I'm just the mistress who ruined her marriage. She probably thinks I deserved this—that my child deserved to die."

Ethan's fists clenched. The same thought had crossed his mind.

Her behavior in the car had been unforgivable—gloating about artificial wombs while en route to a dead child's grave.

She was mocking us.

"You're right," he said coldly. "I was a fool to expect remorse. If she'd truly regretted her actions, she wouldn't have vanished for four years."

He exhaled sharply, purging the last shred of hope that Vivian could change. As dusk fell, he drove Cassandra out of the forest.

Under the pale moonlight, Vivian finally stirred. Pain exploded through her skull. Her left leg lay twisted—useless. She couldn't move.
###Chapter 419

Vivian's fingers trembled as she reached for her shattered phone. The screen remained stubbornly black, refusing to power on.

"That damn Nathaniel Blackwood! I should've known he'd bring me nothing but trouble!" She cursed under her breath, scanning the inky darkness around her. Not a soul in sight.

A cold dread slithered down her spine. "Hello? Is anyone there? Help!" Her voice cracked, swallowed by the eerie caws of distant crows.

Pain throbbed in her skull and leg, sharp enough to steal her breath. Even screaming felt impossible now.

"I can't die here... not like this..."

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Estate, the family sat around the grand dining table, though the air hung heavy with unspoken tension.

Eleanor Whitmore kept pressing her son. "Nathaniel, have you spoken to Vivian at all?" She'd just learned that Vivian—missing for four long years—had suddenly reappeared in Newport City.

Eleanor's feelings toward Vivian were complicated. Part of her still blamed the woman for Cassandra Delacroix's lost child, enough that she'd once hired men to hunt her down. But watching Nathaniel drown in misery those four years had chipped away at her anger.

She knew. Her son still loved Vivian. Only Vivian could bring light back into his eyes.

"Nathaniel, we support whatever decision you make." Eleanor forced a smile. "The past is the past. What matters now is your happiness."

"I have it handled." Nathaniel's tone was ice, his attention fixed on his plate.

The table fell silent.

Then Eleanor remembered. "Nathaniel, you've been visiting that cemetery too often. It's dangerous—just last week, some influencers died there after falling off the cliffs!"

"Cliffs?" Nathaniel's head snapped up.

"Yes! The fog makes navigation impossible. And that shaman—why did he have to pick such a cursed ce?"

Leonard Kingsley nodded. "An unnatural death requires a secluded burial. You shouldn't go there anymore."

"It's not like Nathaniel wants to. It's because of Cassandra—"

Nathaniel stood abruptly. "I need to leave."
###Chapter 420

The engine roared as Nathaniel Blackwood slammed his foot on the accelerator. The sleek black car tore through the night, heading straight for the dense woods outside Newport City.

Eleanor Whitmore's dinner conversation had sparked his memory. The Kingsley family cemetery had treacherous terrain and perpetual fog. A cold dread settled in his chest at the possibility Isabella might be trapped there.

The odds were slim, but he couldn't shake the unease. He needed to see for himself.

Headlights cut through the darkness like twin blades. Nathaniel's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel, his piercing gaze scanning the shadowy landscape as he called out.

"Isabella!"

Silence swallowed his voice, broken only by the startled flutter of nocturnal birds. When he reached the spot where he'd abandoned her earlier, he threw open the car door.

"Vivian Lockhart! Where the hell are you?" His shout echoed through the trees, raw with urgency.

Only the mocking caw of a raven answered.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. This was ridiculous. She was probably safe in her penthouse, curled under silk sheets while he played the fool in this godforsaken forest.

'Three more tries,' he told himself. 'Then I'm done with this madness.'

"Last chance, Lockhart! Answer me or I'm leaving!"

At the cliff's base, Isabella drifted in and out of consciousness. Pain and exhaustion had drained her. Hunger gnawed at her insides like a living thing.

Then - a voice. Nathaniel's voice.

Her first instinct was relief. Then pride kicked in. Being rescued by him? Unbearable. She'd never hear the end of it.

She remained stubbornly silent until his final ultimatum. Then came the softest, most reluctant cough she could muster.

Nathaniel froze. "Is that you? Where are you?"

The darkness and tangled undergrowth made navigation impossible. Isabella coughed again, louder this time.

"Don't move!" Nathaniel's voice sharpened. "I'm coming!"

She heard rustling, then panic seized her. "Wait, you idiot-"

Too late. A crashing sound, then a heavy thud as Nathaniel tumbled down the slope.

Isabella barely rolled aside in time. "Christ! Were you trying to kill us both?" Her heart hammered against her ribs.

Her would-be savior now lay in a heap beside her. Typical.

She peered through the gloom. "Blackwood? You alive?"

A groan. "Unfortunately."
###Chapter 421

Ethan clutched his dislocated leg, beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead.

Yet he forced his features into their usual arrogant mask.

"That's good." Vivian felt some tension leave her shoulders.

'This man's resilience is insane - surviving a multi-mile cliff fall without major injuries? Color me impressed.'

"How are you holding up?" Ethan gritted through the pain, inching toward Vivian in the darkness.

"Horrible! Pretty sure I've got a concussion, my leg's definitely broken, I'm exhausted, freezing, and starving to death!"

Vivian attempted to rise several times, but her shattered leg refused to cooperate, leaving her stranded. The gnawing hunger made her certain she was seeing the afterlife's welcoming light.

"How does someone even fall just from walking? Were you born this clumsy? Couldn't you have called for help?" Worry sharpened Ethan's words to a cutting edge.

'Four years later and she's still hopeless at self-preservation!'

"My phone's dead!" Vivian snapped back. "Like you're one to talk - you fell too! Just got lucky with fewer injuries!"

"I fell because I—" Ethan began heatedly, then abruptly silenced himself.

"Because what?" Vivian teased, smirking at his sudden reticence. "Too proud to admit your own stupidity? I warned you, yet you came charging in like the devil was on your heels!"

"Fine! I, Ethan Blackwood, am the world's biggest fool. Why else would I come rescue you at midnight?" His scoff carried icy frustration.

'Does she truly not realize I'm in this mess because of her?' The thought burned.

"I never asked for saving! I coughed because my throat was dry! You chose to come barreling in - don't blame me!" Vivian's stubbornness flared. She refused to owe him anything.

Their accounts were settled. No further entanglements needed.

"Give me your phone. I'll call someone to haul us out."

Ethan's leg pulsed with worsening agony, signaling graver damage than he'd admitted. Walking was impossible, let alone carrying Vivian to safety.

He tossed the phone toward her with characteristic arrogance. "Let's see who besides me would bother rescuing you."

Vivian immediately dialed Nathan's number, only to meet crushing despair when zero signal bars appeared. "What kind of cursed cave is this? No service at all!"

"No signal?" Ethan's frown deepened.

'If we can't call for help... Both injured in this remote pit...' His mind raced. 'The cliff's depth explains the dead zone. We need higher ground.'

Vivian recalled receiving Kevin's texts on the main road. Signal likely waited just half a mile upward - an impossible journey through dark, treacherous forest with their injuries.

"Then we climb." Ethan's voice held steely resolve.

"My leg—" Vivian gestured helplessly. "If I could move, I'd already be gone—"

Her words died as Ethan crouched before her. "Arms around my neck. I'm carrying you out."
###Chapter 422

The pale moonlight cast shadows across Nathaniel Blackwood's broad shoulders as he knelt before me.

"Inappropriate?" I hesitated, fingers twisting in the fabric of my torn dress.

His voice cut through the night like frost. "Get on or stay here. Your choice."

I didn't see how his injured leg trembled beneath us. Didn't know each step sent white-hot agony shooting through his bones.

"Fine." I looped my arms around his neck, pressing close to his back.

Nathaniel gritted his teeth as he stood. Even his powerful frame swayed under my weight.

"Are you okay?" I whispered, feeling the dampness of his shirt. "You're shaking."

"Perfectly...fine." Each word sounded forced.

Blood seeped through his trousers where bone threatened to pierce skin. Sweat rolled down his temples. Yet he climbed. One excruciating step after another.

"You're lying." My fingers brushed his damp collar. "Should we rest—"

"Do I look fragile to you?" A strained chuckle. "Though you weigh enough to crush a lesser man."

"120 pounds!" I smacked his shoulder. "Maybe you're just weak beneath that expensive suit."

Relief flooded me. If he could still insult me, he couldn't be that hurt. Nathaniel would never joke while bleeding.

The road appeared like a mirage. He practically threw me into the backseat.

"Check...for signal." His knuckles whitened around his thigh. "Call someone. Anyone. Before you...break my spine."

My fingers closed around his phone. "Two bars! Password?"

Nathaniel's breathing turned ragged. Blood painted his fingertips crimson where he clutched his leg.

"000809."

The numbers sparked recognition. "This means something."

"Just...call." His face had gone ghostly pale.

I didn't see the pool of blood forming at his feet. Didn't know each breath cost him dearly.

The screen blurred as I dialed. Why did those numbers haunt me?

Nathaniel slumped against the door, his vision darkening. Still, he watched me. Ensuring I was safe.

Even as the world faded to black.
###Chapter 423

"Got it!" Vivian couldn't quite recall where she'd seen those numbers, but there was no time to dwell on it. Her fingers flew over the keypad as she dialed. The call connected instantly.

"Nathaniel, it's me. Can you come get me from X cemetery?"

On the other end, Nathaniel had been frantic since Vivian vanished. He'd nearly stormed the Blackwood estate searching for her. Hearing her voice now sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.

As they spoke, Ethan couldn't take it anymore. He snatched the phone and barked, "Enough! She's injured—get here now!"

That's when Vivian noticed the blood coating Ethan's hands. Her breath hitched. "Blackwood, where—where is all this blood coming from? Are you hurt too?"

"I'm fine." He jerked his hand away.

"Stop lying! You're bleeding everywhere!" Vivian grabbed the phone's flashlight, scanning his body with frantic urgency.

Her stomach dropped when she found the source—his left leg, drenched in blood, the bone clearly dislocated. The wound was gruesome.

"Your leg!" She clapped a hand over her mouth.

How had he carried her all this way in this condition? Every step must have been excruciating, especially with her weight on his back.

"I said I'm fine. Stop looking." He snatched the phone back, his jaw tight. He'd tried to hide it—didn't want her seeing him like this. The vulnerability made his skin crawl.

"This isn't just a sprain—your leg is dislocated! If we don't stabilize it now, you could lose it!" She yanked off her shirt, ready to improvise a bandage.

"Ah!" Pain lanced through her as she moved, reminding her of her own injury.

"You're the one who needs treatment." Ethan staggered forward, gripping her injured leg. He wrapped her shirt around it tightly, securing the makeshift bandage.

"Don't worry about me—you're worse off! You—"

"Shut up and stay still." His voice was rough as he worked, using his limited first-aid knowledge to tend to her. But the metallic scent of blood filled his nostrils, making his vision swim.

"Hey! Blackwood! Don't you dare faint on me now!" Vivian nudged him with her foot, torn between frustration and worry.

Of all times for his blood phobia to kick in!

Yet, her chest tightened remembering how he'd gritted through the pain to carry her to safety.

Why couldn't he just stay cold and distant like usual? Why risk his life for me? What does he want?

Tires screeched in the distance. Liam had arrived, speeding like a madman.

"You two—" His voice cracked at the sight of them—Vivian and Ethan, battered and bleeding on the ground. His heart plummeted.
###Chapter 424

"It's complicated. Just get us to the hospital now!" Vivian insisted, her voice tight with urgency. Every second counted, especially with Nathaniel's life hanging in the balance.

"Fine." Liam clenched his jaw, swallowing his resentment as he hauled the unconscious man into the car.

The tires screeched against the pavement as he sped toward the nearest medical center. The moment they arrived, he scooped Vivian into his arms, shouting for help with wild desperation.

"Somebody—anybody—help her!"

But Vivian twisted in his grip, her gaze locked on Nathaniel, still slumped in the backseat. She dug her fingers into Liam's arm. "Forget about me—he's worse off! He needs treatment first!"

Liam had never disobeyed her before. But this time, he kept running, his strides long and frantic.

His voice dropped low, strained. "Vivian, I respect you. But don't mistake me for a saint. I brought him here—that’s more than he deserves. Don’t ask me to care."

The doctors rushed her into surgery immediately. A concussion. A fractured leg. Not life-threatening, but serious enough to keep her under observation for twenty-four hours.

By the next day, she was transferred to a standard ward, her leg encased in plaster, her body anchored to the bed.

Liam entered with a tray of food, his expression tight with worry. "You must be starving. Eat something."

She ignored the meal, gripping his wrist instead. "Nathaniel. Tell me he’s okay."

Liam’s jaw tensed. He stirred the congee, avoiding her eyes. "Sea cucumber congee. Good for healing."

She shoved the spoon away. "I won’t eat until you tell me."

His forced smile vanished. "Four years, and you’re still hung up on him?" His voice cracked. "After everything I’ve done—risking my family’s future for you—you still choose him?"

"Liam—"

"Don’t." His hands trembled. "We’re getting married. Do you even see me as your fiancé?"

The raw hurt in his eyes made her chest ache.

She exhaled slowly. "You want to know why I care?"

"Because you love him!" He slammed the tray onto the bedside table. "After everything he did to you—how can you still—?"

Her voice was eerily calm. "That’s not why."

"Then why?"

She met his gaze, unflinching. "Because he saved my life."

Liam froze.

And for the first time, the truth hung between them—heavy, undeniable.
###Chapter 425

"Because he carried me up that cliff despite his own severe injuries." Vivian's voice trembled as she clutched the hospital sheets. "If anything happens to him... if he loses that leg... I'll never forgive myself. That's why I kept asking about his condition. Do you understand now?"

Liam spun around, his face pale with shock. "He... carried you? That's impossible! The state of his injuries... He couldn't even walk properly when we found him!"

"I didn't believe it either." Vivian's fingers twisted the fabric tighter. "Ethan Blackwood - cold, calculating, selfish to the core - yet he dragged himself up that cliff with me on his back. Without him, I'd still be lying there, bleeding out or starving to death."

The memory burned behind her eyelids - Ethan's ragged breathing, the way his muscles trembled with each step, the blood soaking through his pants. No ordinary man could have endured that agony.

Not even her closest family would have made that sacrifice. Certainly not the man who'd once wrapped his hands around her throat.

Liam shook his head violently. "Look at the scans! The tissue damage, the shattered nerves - it's medically impossible!"

"So tell me," Vivian's voice dropped to a whisper, "how is he really? His leg...?"

Liam exhaled sharply. "They're still in surgery. Consulting multiple specialists. Debating between..." He hesitated.

"Between what?"

"Conservative treatment risks systemic infection. The nerve damage is... extensive. Muscle tissue necrotizing. Blood flow compromised." Liam's jaw worked. "If they don't amputate in time..."

The words hit like physical blows. Shattered nerves. Dying tissue. Amputation.

Vivian's vision swam. That minor accident... because he pushed past human limits carrying her...

"Take me to him. Now." She grabbed Liam's wrist, tears streaking her face. "I need to see him!"

"Don't blame yourself." Liam squeezed her hand. "This is on me - I should've gotten him to ER faster." His voice cracked. "If they take that leg... hell, I'll give him mine."
###Chapter 426

Nathaniel's condition weighed heavily on Vivian's mind. She couldn't shake the image of him lying motionless after the fall.

Liam noticed her distress. "Don't torture yourself," he said, adjusting her blanket. "I'll check with the doctors. That man's built like a tank—he'll pull through."

A weak laugh escaped Vivian's lips. "You're right. He's survived worse. Remember when he walked out of that burning warehouse last year?"

"Exactly! Now stay put." Liam pointed to the untouched food tray. "Eat something. The twins need their mother healthy."

The moment Liam left, Vivian's anxiety returned. What if Nathaniel never walked again? The guilt would destroy her.

When Liam returned twenty minutes later, his grim expression sent her pulse racing.

"Well?" She gripped the sheets. "How bad is it?"

Liam's gaze dropped to the cold congee. "You didn't eat." His voice held an edge she rarely heard.

"Damn the food!" Vivian's voice cracked. "Tell me!"

A muscle twitched in Liam's jaw. "The specialists say amputation isn't necessary. Conservative treatment should suffice."

Vivian studied him. "You're lying."

"I'd never." Liam crossed his heart. "On my life, every word's true."

"Then why do you look like you've lost a fortune?"

Liam scoffed. "Should I be celebrating? My rival gets to play the wounded hero while I—" He cut himself off with a dramatic sigh.

Relief washed over Vivian. She reached for the bowl with renewed energy. "Thank God. Now I can actually keep food down."

"Told you he's indestructible." Liam forced a smile as she devoured the congee.

But when Vivian wasn't looking, his expression darkened. The truth was far worse than he'd admitted—Nathaniel's spinal injuries might be permanent. And that was something Liam would take to his grave.
###Chapter 427

The truth was far worse than anyone imagined. Nathaniel's leg injury had reached catastrophic levels. The surrounding tissue was so severely damaged that amputation became a real possibility - along with the risk of losing his life entirely.

"I'm stuffed! Absolutely stuffed!" Vivian rubbed her full stomach with a satisfied smile. She turned to Liam with curious eyes. "When did the doctor say this cast could come off? And when can I leave this hospital?"

"That depends entirely on your recovery progress and cooperation. Minimum two weeks. Maximum... could be months."

"Then I'd better rest properly. Once I'm fully healed, I need to personally thank Ethan for saving me."

Liam's expression immediately darkened. "You don't owe him anything! After everything he put you through, consider this his way of making amends. What's there to thank him for?"

He couldn't bear the thought of Vivian discovering Nathaniel's true condition. The shock might devastate her. In Liam's mind, it was better if these two never crossed paths again.

"Still holding grudges, aren't you?" Vivian chuckled, gently patting Liam's shoulder. "Don't worry, my dear Liam. I promise you - even if every other man on earth disappeared, I would never go back to him. Okay? So stop being so jealous!"

She playfully poked his puffed cheeks. "Look at you, all pouty and adorable when you're sulking!"

"Fine..." Liam sighed in resignation.

He thought wryly to himself, 'Only my boss would dare treat the infamous 'Devil Incarnate' like some petulant child.'

Now all he could do was pray Nathaniel possessed the legendary toughness everyone credited him with.

After ensuring Vivian was safely asleep, Liam rushed to the surgical ward.

Nathaniel had always been his greatest rival, not to mention how terribly he'd treated Vivian. Liam had every reason to despise the man. Yet knowing he was the love of Vivian's life - and father to those precious twins - he couldn't bring himself to wish for Nathaniel's demise.

Liam loved Vivian enough to give her anything, even if it meant stepping aside should she ever reconcile with Nathaniel.

The operating room doors remained firmly shut, the glowing red "Surgery in Progress" sign casting an ominous light. At this midnight hour, the corridor stood empty except for Liam.

He stared at that relentless red glow, anxiety coiling tighter with each passing minute. Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined worrying about his rival's survival.

Hours crawled by. Just as exhaustion from standing began weighing on him, the doors finally swung open.

The surgeon emerged, shaking his head with a heavy sigh.

"Doctor? How is he? Will he... make it?"

"I'm sorry. We did everything possible. The tissue damage was too extensive, causing systemic infection. We couldn't save him..."

"No! That's impossible! He's indestructible! There's no way—" Liam staggered back, the words hitting like physical blows.

The doctor placed a consoling hand on his shoulder. "My deepest condolences."
###Chapter 428

"No... This can't be happening! I refuse to believe it!" Liam's knees buckled as he collapsed onto the cold hospital floor, his voice barely above a whisper.

The sterile white doors of the operating room swung open, revealing a gurney being wheeled out. A motionless figure lay beneath the stark white sheet, the outline unmistakably tall and broad-shouldered.

"Would you like to see him one last time?" The doctor's tone was clinical, his gaze fixed on Liam's ashen face. "If not, we'll proceed directly to the mortuary. You should make arrangements soon."

Liam swallowed hard, his throat dry. He wanted to stand, to pull back that sheet—but the weight of reality crushed him before he could move.

"No," he muttered, shaking his head, unable to meet the doctor's eyes.

With a nod, the medical staff continued down the hall, the wheels of the gurney squeaking faintly against the linoleum.

Ethan Blackwood is dead.

The words echoed like a nightmare in Liam's skull, relentless and suffocating. His hands clenched into fists. That indomitable man—gone, just like that?

I can't accept this. And if I can't, how will Vivian?

His jaw tightened. She can't know. Not yet. Not until she's strong enough.

The next morning, Liam arrived at Vivian's room with a tray of her favorite breakfast—fluffy pancakes, fresh berries, and steaming coffee.

"You're up early," she remarked, setting aside her book with a small smile.

"How are you feeling? Any pain?" He adjusted the overbed table, arranging the food carefully in front of her.

"None at all!" She grinned, already reaching for the syrup. "If the nurses hadn't stopped me, I would've sprinted down the hallway."

As she dug in, Vivian's expression turned serious. "What about Ethan? Is he out of surgery? The nurses wouldn't tell me anything."

Liam's fingers twitched, but his voice remained steady. "He's fine. The specialists handled everything. You know how it is—nothing less than perfection for Mr. Blackwood."

"Good." Relief softened her features as she took another bite. "Oh—did you bring him breakfast too? Don't forget."

"Of course not." Liam forced a chuckle. "He saved your life. Taking care of him is taking care of you."

"You're the best." She reached out, pinching his cheek affectionately.

As her most trusted confidant, she never doubted him. If Liam handled something, it was done right.

"Eat up. I'll go check on him," he said, already turning toward the door, his smile vanishing the second his back was to her.

If the Blackwoods arrived demanding answers, the truth would explode in his face. He needed to move fast—hide Ethan's body, buy time.

At the mortuary, Liam flashed a practiced smile at the attendant. "I'm family. I need to see him."

The lie tasted bitter, but it was necessary.

For Vivian's sake.
###Chapter 429

The guard shook his head. "I'm sorry, but the body was claimed last night."

Nathaniel Blackwood's pulse spiked. "By who?"

"One of Mr. Blackwood's relatives. They came late last night."

So the Blackwoods know. His mind raced. Then why is everything so quiet?

He pulled out his phone, scanning headlines—financial news, gossip sites, even Blackwood Group's official channels. Nothing. The silence was unnerving.

This doesn't add up. Was it even him?

"Are you certain it was Nathaniel Blackwood? CEO of Blackwood Group?"

The guard nodded. "Positive. His father identified him personally."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, suspicion gnawing at him as he returned to Vivian Lockhart's hospital room.

Inside, Sophia Osborne and her boyfriend, William Carter, were already there.

"Viv!" Sophia rushed forward, eyes glistening. "I nearly lost my mind when you vanished! What happened? Who hurt you? I swear I'll make them pay!"

Vivian squeezed her hand. "Relax. Just a clumsy fall. A few weeks of rest and I'll be fine."

William stepped in. "My father knows top orthopedic specialists. I can arrange consultations if you'd like, Miss Lockhart."

Sophia cut in before Vivian could respond. "Obviously she needs them! Call them now. Only the best for Viv."

William nodded, already reaching for his phone.

Vivian hesitated. "Actually... there's someone else who might need them more. Nathaniel Blackwood."

Sophia blinked. "Wait—what? He got hurt too? Saving you?"

"Nearly lost a leg doing it." Vivian's voice was steady, but her fingers tightened around the sheets. "He’s stable now, but a specialist should check him."

Sophia gaped. Since when does that arrogant bastard play the hero?

Liam chose that moment to stride in. "Blackwood can afford his own doctors. If you push too hard, he’ll assume you’re still hung up on him."

Sophia nodded vigorously. "Exactly. You know how his ego works. Don’t give him the wrong idea."

Vivian sighed. They weren’t wrong. "Fine. I’ll drop it."

After a while, Sophia and William rose to leave.

"Wait," Vivian called. "William, I need to speak with you alone. Just for a minute."
###Chapter 430

Sophia nodded instantly. "Absolutely!" She shared her brother's unwavering trust in Vivian. "Bestie, I need you to vet this guy. Your opinion matters most."

Before exiting the ward, Sophia shot Vivian a playful smirk and gave William's shoulder a light tap. "Better impress my bestie, or this wedding isn't happening."

William's smile never wavered. "No pressure. I'm certain Ms. Lockhart will recognize my sincerity." His gaze locked onto Vivian. "Isn't that right?"

"Perhaps." Vivian's lips curled into an enigmatic smile.

The moment the siblings left, her expression hardened. "Close the door."

William complied without protest, his demeanor still warm. "I assume you've already dug into my background, Ms. Lockhart."

Vivian arched a brow. "Smarter than you look."

"Flattery won't help your case. Sophia talks about you constantly—loyal, sharp, meticulous. Of course you'd investigate me before blessing our marriage."

"At least you're self-aware. I'll admit, your record is... surprisingly clean." Vivian hadn’t expected such humility. His lack of defensiveness unsettled her.

"Then cut the act. Why are you really pursuing Sophia?" She wasn’t here for games.

William chuckled. "What other reason could there be? I love her. I want to marry her, build a life together."

"Spare me." Disgust flickered across her face. "Sophia might buy that, but I won’t. Not with your history of obsession. And don’t pretend you’re unaware your ex is persona non grata in our circles."

His smile chilled. "Ah. Cassandra Delacroix." A muscle twitched in his jaw. "Impressive reach, Ms. Lockhart. I didn’t think you’d uncover That chapter."

"First love, wasn’t she? Drove you to madness. Yet here you are, claiming you’ve moved on?"

"It’s the truth. That darkness is behind me. I’ve rebuilt myself. All I ask is the chance to prove it."

Vivian scoffed. "Victim act won’t work. Obsession like yours doesn’t just vanish. You want something from her."

His gaze turned razor-sharp. "Funny. Weren’t you once obsessed with Nathaniel Blackwood? Yet here you are, judging me for daring to love again."

Her breath hitched. "That’s different."

"Is it? Or are you just bitter because I chose your best friend?" He tilted his head. "Unless... you never truly moved on from him?"

"Don’t project your issues onto me!" she snapped.

"Then why the double standard? If you can love again, why can’t I?" His voice dropped. "Or is this just jealousy in disguise?"

Vivian’s fists clenched. "Maybe it is."
###Chapter 431

The explanation made logical sense, yet Cassandra couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something wasn't right. The timing was far too convenient to be mere coincidence.

"Prove you have nothing to hide by telling Sophia everything about your history with Cassandra. If she accepts your explanation, I'll drop the matter completely," Vivian demanded sharply.

Her greatest fear was that she'd inadvertently dragged Sophia into this mess. Every encounter with that woman seemed to bring nothing but trouble.

"I understand your concerns perfectly, and I don't need the reminder. I'll have that conversation with Sophia," Nathaniel promised, his voice carrying genuine sincerity.

"Good. Make sure you're completely honest. Remember this conversation - if I catch you playing games, you'll regret it deeply." Vivian delivered her final warning as Nathaniel showed no signs of deception.

As Nathaniel exited the room, Sophia rushed to meet him. "How did it go with my best friend? Did you pass her interrogation?"

"I'd say I scored about 80%," Nathaniel admitted truthfully.

"That's excellent! You've basically won her over already." Sophia beamed. No one understood Vivian like she did. An 80% approval rating from Vivian was practically a glowing endorsement.

Nathaniel suddenly grasped Sophia's hand tightly. "Sophia, if you were ever forced to choose between Vivian and me, who would you pick?"

"Is that even a question?" Sophia answered without hesitation. "My dearest Viv, obviously. Don't even try competing for that spot - you'll never win."

Her expression showed no trace of humor - she meant every word. Though Vivian often teased her about being lovesick, Sophia knew some bonds took priority over romantic relationships.

If forced to choose, Sophia would always pick her best friend. Men might betray or hurt her, but Vivian never would.

"And if Miss Lockhart told you to break up with me?"

"I would."

"You'd believe whatever Miss Lockhart said?"

"Absolutely."

A shadow crossed Nathaniel's face. "I see."

"You're acting strange today. Why these sudden questions? What did Viv tell you?" Sophia studied Nathaniel's odd behavior with growing concern.

"Nothing important. Just curious." Nathaniel's evasive eyes betrayed secrets that weighed heavily on his conscience.

After parting ways with Sophia, Nathaniel reached the underground parking garage. Sitting in his car, he dialed Cassandra's number.

"I've delivered what you wanted. When will you honor your end of our agreement?" His voice dropped to a hushed whisper.

The voice that responded bore no resemblance to Cassandra's usual unstable persona - neither weak nor pitiful. Instead, an icy tone demanded, "Patience. Maintain the act. I still need to locate those two brats precisely."
###Chapter 432

Nathaniel's face darkened with concern. He hesitated before speaking. "Can you at least tell me what you're planning to do with them?"

Cassandra's eyes turned icy. "Since when do you question me?" Her voice dripped with venom. "You know exactly what I've suffered. You swore your love, promised to move mountains for me. Now's your chance to prove it. Fail me, and you'll regret it. Succeed, and I'll give you everything."

Nathaniel clenched his fists. A sharp inhale. "I won't fail you. My devotion is absolute—even if the world abandons you, I never will."

A cruel smile twisted Cassandra's lips. "Better not. Empty words disgust me, Nathaniel. I despise men who break promises."

Her manicured finger tapped the table. "That woman's friend—Leia. You've known her for years. What else have you learned? Besides the two brats?"

"Nothing useful. Sophia's loyalty is... problematic. She'd die for Vivian. Pushing harder would raise suspicion."

Cassandra laughed, the sound like shattering glass. "Loyalty? Don't be naive. Friendships crumble the moment a man steps between them. Imagine if her precious Vivian was caught seducing her boyfriend?"

Nathaniel stiffened. "You're suggesting—"

"Exactly." Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "That witch ruined everything. Four years I played the grieving lover. The suicide attempts, the hysterics—all to keep Ethan's pity. And now she waltzes back?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "This time, I'll destroy her."

A thought struck Nathaniel. "Speaking of Ethan... Liam mentioned something. Have you heard?"

Cassandra's brow furrowed. "What?"

"Rumors say Ethan was injured rescuing Vivian. Hospital records show an ER visit, but he's vanished since. The Blackwoods are clueless."

"Interesting." Cassandra's eyes gleamed. "If Vivian's hiding him... this could be her downfall. Dig deeper. If she's involved, I'll make sure the world knows."

At Blackwood Estate, sunlight dappled through rose bushes in full bloom. Margaret hummed, watering can in hand, oblivious to the storm brewing.
###Chapter 433

"Vivian, don't you think the lilies in our garden are exceptionally vibrant this season? They seem larger too!" Margaret Whitmore remarked to the housekeeper beside her, who stood ready to attend to her needs.

"Hmm?" Lydia wanted to point out that the lilies bloomed the same way every year, just as they were now.

But she didn't want to dampen Margaret's spirits, so she agreed, "Yes, there are more blossoms this year, and they're quite stunning—just like last season!"

Margaret's sharp gaze flicked toward Lydia, and she huffed indignantly. "How can you compare them to last year's? They're clearly more magnificent now! Oh, and—do you know what fully bloomed lilies symbolize?"

"Uh... what do they represent?"

"They signify an enduring, blissful marriage. Since this year's flowers are flourishing so splendidly, it's a divine sign that my son and daughter-in-law are destined to reunite and stay together forever!" Margaret exclaimed joyfully. She plucked one of the blossoms and cradled it in her palm, as if she could glimpse Nathaniel and Isabella's radiant future within its petals.

"Do lilies in bloom truly symbolize that?" Lydia muttered under her breath, skepticism lacing her tone. She had never heard of such an interpretation.

"Who cares? It means what I say it means. Now, gather the finest blooms and arrange them into a bouquet. I'll need them later," Margaret instructed in a cryptic tone.

"Of course." Lydia retrieved a pair of shears and began trimming the stems, carefully placing the lilies into her basket.

As she worked, she ventured cautiously, "Madam, I've noticed you seem even happier about Miss Lockhart's return than Master Blackwood is. Do her past actions toward Miss Delacroix not trouble you at all?"

Margaret's cheerful expression dimmed. She replied flatly, "Ugh, must you be such a killjoy? Why bring up unpleasant matters now?"

"My apologies, Madam. But I can't help but notice how drastically your opinion of Miss Lockhart has shifted. I don't understand what she could have done to earn your favor so completely."

The question had gnawed at Lydia for ages, but she'd never dared voice it until now.

"Well... I can't explain it precisely. I just find her remarkably capable and devoted. When my son was nearly paralyzed years ago, she refused to leave his side, tending to him day and night. That alone changed my perception of her."

"And her cooking—absolutely divine, especially her lemon-glazed chicken feet. I've craved them for four long years, even dreaming about them. She's also quite striking—charming, sweet, elegant without being pretentious, and—"

Lydia had expected a simple answer, not this effusive praise. Margaret even pulled up a viral video of Isabella, eagerly showing off her latest exploits.

"Look at her agility! She's extraordinary! Reminds me of my younger self. How could I not adore her?" Margaret gushed.

"Most importantly, my foolish son is utterly smitten. That boy took forever to understand love and has never truly cared for anyone before. Now that someone has finally captured his heart, of course I want them to stay together."

Lydia nodded. "True. Ever since Miss Lockhart left, Master Blackwood has been miserable. I haven't seen him genuinely smile in years. Hopefully, this reconciliation will last."

"Naturally. But my son seems hesitant to make a move this time. That's why I, as his mother, must step in. I won't let those two miss their chance again!"

As Margaret and Lydia strategized how to reunite Nathaniel and Isabella, a servant announced, "Madam, Miss Delacroix is here to see you."

"Oh, her. Tell her I'm occupied and can't meet right now," Margaret replied, irritation flashing across her face.

"But... Miss Delacroix insists she has urgent news to share!"
###Chapter 434

"Fine, let her in!" Margaret Whitmore sighed with visible reluctance.

Truth be told, she had little patience for Cassandra Delacroix. If not for the woman's pregnancy with a Blackwood heir—and her subsequent pitiful state—she would have cut ties long ago.

Moments later, a servant escorted a pale, trembling Cassandra into the garden.

"Look at her, dressed like she's attending a funeral! She'll curse us with that miserable aura!" Margaret scoffed, shooting Edith a disdainful glance.

"Mrs. Whitmore!" Cassandra's voice quivered as she approached, tears already spilling. "I've ruined everything this time! You must help me—if you don't, Nathaniel might never forgive me! He'll abandon me forever!"

"Really?" Margaret's first thought was pure relief. Finally, my son is free of this leech.

Still, she maintained her dignified composure. "Stop crying and explain. I'll see what I can do."

Cassandra wiped her tears with a shaky hand. "It's all my fault... You know Vivian Lockhart is back in town, right? The memories... they overwhelmed me. I just wanted her to visit my child's grave, to apologize properly so my baby could rest in peace..."

Margaret nodded solemnly. Reasonable. Regardless of intent, Vivian caused that child's death. An apology is the least she owes.

"But Vivian—she's so arrogant! She refused to admit any wrongdoing! Nathaniel had to intervene... It took so much effort just to make her agree..."

"And then?" Margaret's expression darkened, urging Cassandra to continue.

Though she wanted reconciliation between Vivian and Nathaniel, she'd never condone such heartlessness. A life had been lost—how could Vivian dismiss it?

"On the way to the mountains, she kept mocking my baby. Nathaniel was furious. He kicked her out of the car... and now he won't even speak to me!" Cassandra's voice broke. "Mrs. Whitmore, please... call him. Tell him I'll obey his every word from now on! I won't force Vivian to visit the grave anymore—just make him forgive me!"

Margaret's temper flared. "Why are you apologizing? Vivian murdered a Blackwood heir! Demanding she face that grave isn't unreasonable—it's basic decency!"

"Exactly!" Edith chimed in, scowling. "Vivian got off lightly! The Blackwoods showed mercy by not pressing charges!"

She'd heard rumors of Vivian's behavior but never imagined such cruelty. How could the family tolerate her? In Edith's eyes, Cassandra was the victim—fragile, blameless.

Margaret, however, wasn't entirely convinced. Vivian was wild, yes, but not heartless. There had to be more to this story.
###Chapter 435

Vivian's fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone, dialing Ethan's private line. "I need to hear his side of the story. There's no way that girl would dare act so brazenly!"

The call went straight to voicemail. Even Ethan's assistant, Elijah, had no clue about his whereabouts.

"This isn't like him." Margaret's perfectly manicured nails tapped anxiously against her phone case. "He should be at Blackwood Group headquarters right now. The NEON-X prototype launch is next week, and the QuantumTech merger requires his signature."

Her pulse quickened as she tried every contact in her phone. Each call yielded the same result - nobody had seen Ethan since yesterday.

A cold dread settled in her stomach. The tech industry was on the brink of revolution. Once the QuantumTech deal closed, competitors would be wiped out overnight. Blackwood Group would dominate the market for decades.

And now her son had vanished right before the most crucial business deal of his career.

The boardroom wars had claimed Sebastian years ago. Was history repeating itself?

"We're calling the police." Margaret's voice cracked as she punched 911 with shaking fingers. Her vision blurred with unshed tears.

She couldn't lose another son. Not like this.

"Mrs. Whitmore," Cassandra interjected smoothly, "perhaps Mr. Blackwood went after Miss Lockhart? They had quite the argument at the cemetery yesterday."

"The cemetery?" Margaret's head snapped up. "He rushed out last night when I mentioned it. You think he went back?"

"Apparently Miss Lockhart took quite a fall near the cliffs there." Cassandra's lips curved into a knowing smile. "She might know where he is."

Margaret bolted for the door without grabbing her purse. At the last second, she doubled back to snatch the lilies Isabella had arranged earlier.

"These were meant for her anyway. Let's move!"

Cassandra followed, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes. This time, Vivian Lockhart wouldn't slip through their fingers.
###Chapter 436

Vivian Lockhart and Cassandra Delacroix arrived at the hospital where Isabella was staying.

Nathaniel Blackwood had urgent business with Lockhart Enterprises, leaving Isabella alone in the private ward. She was video-calling her daughter. "Abigail, is Adrian still buried in his research? Is that why he won’t talk to Mommy?"

"Yes, Mommy. Adrian is very serious about his project. No distractions allowed. You might not see him for a while..."

"Not even a peek?" Isabella tapped Abigail’s cheek on the screen, pouting. "Sweetheart, just turn the camera for one second. Let me see him!"

"No way!" Abigail shook her head fiercely. "I pinky-promised Adrian! If I break it, my nose will grow like Pinocchio’s!"

"Fine, fine..." Isabella sighed in defeat. No matter how formidable she was in the business world, her children always reduced her to putty.

They were stubborn—more stubborn than she’d ever been. If they refused, she couldn’t force them.

Still, with Evelyn Whitmore watching over them, along with Coral Haven’s tight security, she wasn’t overly concerned.

"Mommy, does your leg still hurt? I’ll kiss it better!" Abigail blew exaggerated kisses at the camera.

"Oh, my precious girl! I think I’m instantly healed!" Isabella clutched her chest dramatically, wishing she could recover faster and bring them home.

"More kisses! Mwah! Mwah!" Isabella puckered her lips, smothering her phone screen with kisses.

Just then, the door swung open.

Margaret Whitmore stood frozen in the doorway, clutching a bouquet of lilies, her expression caught between shock and secondhand embarrassment.

"Did I... interrupt something?" she asked awkwardly.

Isabella stiffened, her kissy-face still in place. She hadn’t expected Eleanor Whitmore of all people to walk in.

"Mommy, who’s there? I wanna say hi!" Abigail’s cheerful voice piped up from the phone.

"Gotta go, baby!" Isabella ended the call abruptly, schooling her expression into cool indifference. "Eleanor. What a... surprise."

Eleanor’s sharp eyes zeroed in on the phone. "Who were you talking to? I distinctly heard someone call you 'Mommy.'"

"Your hearing must be failing you in your old age," Isabella replied smoothly. "Hallucinations are common at your stage of life."

"Ridiculous." Eleanor’s voice was razor-sharp. "My hearing is impeccable. There was a child on that call. Did you have a secret baby during your disappearance four years ago?"

Isabella’s mind raced for an excuse—

Cassandra cut in smoothly. "Miss Whitmore, you misheard. Miss Lockhart was clearly speaking to a friend. It’s trendy now—girls using cutesy nicknames. Right, Miss Lockhart?"
###Chapter 437

"Absolutely!" Vivian nodded eagerly. "My friends are all eccentric - we even call each other Mama in private!"

"What on earth... Your friends are just as strange as you!" Eleanor exclaimed. Though she found it bizarre, she didn't push further. This wasn't why she'd come anyway.

Her eyes lingered on the exquisite lily bouquet resting on Vivian's bedside table before pulling up a chair. Her casual movements suggested an intimate familiarity with the injured woman.

"Tell me. Where have you been hiding after that disastrous mistake? Did you remarry? Any children?" Eleanor carried herself like aristocratic royalty, each question dripping with interrogation.

She knew her foolish son would never ask such things, not with his prideful nature. Someone had to do his dirty work.

Vivian's lips curled into a frosty smile. "Mrs. Whitmore, why should I answer you? Are we suddenly close?"

Four years had passed, yet her former mother-in-law remained just as domineering. 'Like mother, like son,' Vivian thought wryly.

Surprisingly, Eleanor didn't erupt this time. "Your evasiveness tells me you're still single. That means you owe Nathaniel compensation!"

"Excuse me? Compensate Nathaniel Blackwood?" Vivian's brow furrowed.

She couldn't decipher the older woman's motives. What game was she playing?

"Naturally!" Eleanor declared righteously. "Four years ago, intentional or not, you cost my son his child."

"Now that you've dared return, you should be prepared to give him another. Get pregnant, and we'll ensure your comfort. Refuse..." Eleanor's eyes turned icy. "The Blackwoods won't be so forgiving."

The woman looked smug. Guilt and threats - the perfect recipe for securing both a grandchild and her son's happiness.

Vivian burst into incredulous laughter. A life for a life might sound fair, but people weren't machines! "Fine, I'll play along. But does Nathaniel agree? What about his precious Cassandra?"

"You'll really do it?" Eleanor's eyes lit up, unprepared for such quick compliance. She'd even brought blank checks as leverage. "Marvelous! Now look here and declare you'll bear Nathaniel's child willingly."

She whipped out her phone, determined to capture Vivian's consent on video.

"Aren't you concerned about Cassandra's feelings? She's Nathaniel's beloved, isn't she?" Vivian gestured toward the silently fuming woman in the corner.

Cassandra stood trembling, lips pressed into a bloodless line.

Though puzzled why Cassandra had helped conceal Abigail's identity, Vivian knew her "mental breakdowns" were merely manipulation tactics.

"Her opinion is irrelevant!" Eleanor waved dismissively, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "You're missing the bigger picture, dear. Who told you Nathaniel loves her most?"
###Chapter 438

Vivian took a deep breath, bracing herself for another confrontation.

Nathaniel's mother Eleanor suddenly cut in with a darkened expression. "Miss Lockhart," she said sharply, turning to Vivian. "We came to ask if you've seen Nathaniel. It's been twenty-four hours since anyone last heard from him."

Her manicured nails dug into her designer handbag. "We've tried every possible way to contact him. His phone goes straight to voicemail. This isn't like him at all. We're terrified something might have happened!"

Vivian's brow furrowed. "You can't reach him?" She shook her head in confusion. "That doesn't make sense. His surgery was completed hours ago. He should have contacted you immediately after waking up."

"Surgery?!" Eleanor's face drained of color. She clutched her chest dramatically. "What surgery? Where is he? What exactly happened to my son?"

Vivian studied Eleanor's reaction and realized with dawning horror that the woman knew nothing about the accident.

After a tense pause, Vivian decided honesty was best. "I fell from a cliff during our trip. Nathaniel got hurt trying to rescue me." She swallowed hard. "From what I heard, his injuries were more severe than mine."

"He had surgery this morning and should be recovering in another ward. Why don't you check with the nurses' station?"

Eleanor's knees nearly buckled. "My boy..." she whispered hysterically. "He must be alright. He has to be!"

Nathaniel was her only remaining child - her entire world. The woman had been known to summon an ambulance when he got a splinter as a child.

Just then, a young nurse entered to change Vivian's IV.

Eleanor pounced like a feral cat, grabbing the nurse's arm with enough force to leave bruises. "Which room is my son in? What's his condition? Is he in critical care?" Her voice rose to a shriek.

The nurse paled, shrinking under Eleanor's manic gaze. "I-I'm sorry, ma'am. Who exactly is your son?"

"You incompetent girl!" Eleanor screeched. "I'm Eleanor Whitmore! My son is Nathaniel Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Group! Don't pretend you don't know who he is!"

The nurse's eyes darted nervously to Vivian before dropping to the floor. "I know who Mr. Blackwood is, but..." She bit her lip, clearly terrified.

Vivian's stomach twisted. She'd been trying to get information about Nathaniel's condition for hours, but every staff member had clammed up. Now she understood why - someone had ordered them to keep silent.

"Stop looking at her and answer me!" Eleanor shook the nurse violently. "What are you hiding? Did something happen to my son that she doesn't want me to know?"

The nurse trembled like a leaf. "Mrs. Whitmore, please! Even if I knew anything, I couldn't say! I'm just a nurse - I don't want trouble!"

Vivian's hands clenched the bedsheets. "What exactly are you implying?" Her voice turned icy. "Do you see me holding a gun to your head?"

"I don't know anything!" The nurse was near tears now. "Please stop asking! I can't afford to make enemies of either family!"

Cassandra saw her opportunity and moved closer, placing a comforting hand on the nurse's shoulder. "Don't be frightened of Miss Lockhart," she said sweetly. "She may seem intimidating, but she's not that scary." Her eyes gleamed with malice. "We just want to know where Nathaniel is and how he's doing. That's all."
###Chapter 439

Vivian's blood boiled at Cassandra's words. She glared daggers at the woman, her thoughts sharp as knives. 'Clever move, bitch. You're clearly insinuating I'm hiding something while pretending to help. Now I'm really screwed!'

"So, Delacroix, you're saying I threatened the nurse to keep Nathaniel's condition from you?"

"I never said that, Miss Lockhart. Don't put words in my mouth. Unless... you are hiding something."

"What could I possibly hide? I want to know his condition just as much as you do! I feel terrible he got hurt saving me, okay?"

"How should I know what's going through your head, Miss Lockhart? Maybe you're trying to avoid responsibility if his condition worsens—"

Their argument escalated, each throwing accusations with alarming precision.

"Enough!" Eleanor's voice cracked like a whip, silencing the room. Her icy glare pinned the trembling nurse. "I don't care who's threatening you. Speak. Now. Or you'll regret crossing me."

"I—I'll tell you everything!" The nurse's loyalty to Liam crumbled under Eleanor's lethal stare.

"Truthfully... only Mr. Osborne and Miss Lockhart know Mr. Blackwood's condition. But the latest update... his life is in danger. Even if he survives, he’ll lose his leg! As for his current state, you’ll have to ask them."

"What?! Life-threatening? Amputation?!" Eleanor swayed, her face draining of color.

"Careful, Mrs. Whitmore!" Cassandra steadied her before turning on Vivian. "Explain this, Lockhart! What happened to Nathaniel? Where is he?"

"I don’t know his condition or his location!" Vivian’s confusion was genuine. "Liam told me the surgery succeeded and he was stable!"

"Then why bring him to another hospital? Why the secrecy?!"

"Stop acting innocent!" Cassandra snarled. "If we knew, would we be interrogating you?"

"You and Liam kidnapped him! This was all a setup—you faked an injury, knowing he’d save you, just to hurt him!"

"Bullshit!" Vivian’s voice turned arctic. "I have no motive—or time—for your delusions!"

"You do!" Eleanor lunged, gripping Vivian’s shoulders. "Where’s my son? Where is he?!"
###Chapter 440

"Please calm down, Mrs. Whitmore!" Vivian struggled to move with her arm in a cast and an IV drip attached.

Eleanor Whitmore had always been volatile. Right now, she was barely holding onto her last shred of sanity. If not for that, she might have strangled Vivian on the spot.

"One chance—that's all I'm giving you! Tell me where Nathaniel is!" Eleanor's grip on Vivian's shoulders tightened, her manic energy fading into desperate tears. "Just tell me if my son is alive. I'm begging you!"

A mother would do anything for her child.

"I already told you—I don't know!" Vivian met her gaze, frustration and sympathy warring inside her. "I didn’t expect him to save me. I have no reason to hurt him or hide him from you!"

As a mother herself, Vivian understood. If their roles were reversed, she wouldn’t have been this restrained. She’d have torn through anyone standing between her and her child.

But understanding didn’t help. She had no answers to give.

Vivian exhaled sharply. Damn it, Nathaniel. What mess have you gotten yourself into now?

"Wait, I’ll call Liam. He might know something." Since everything she’d heard about Nathaniel had come from Liam, he was her best bet.

Just as she reached for her phone, Liam strode into the room. He’d rushed over the moment his meeting ended.

"Let her go!" His voice was ice as he shoved Eleanor back.

"Liam, stop!" Vivian snapped. She took a breath, forcing calm. "You’re here at the right time. Tell them what happened to Nathaniel. Where is he?"

Liam’s anger flickered, replaced by something darker. His smile was cold, mocking. "How is it that you, his own mother, don’t know his condition, Mrs. Whitmore?"

He’d already confirmed with the morgue—Nathaniel’s father had taken the body. Eleanor had to know. Which meant this confrontation wasn’t about answers. It was an attack.

"Again with this nonsense." Cassandra Delacroix stepped forward, eyes blazing. "You and Miss Lockhart keep feeding us the same lies. Do you think we’re fools?" She jabbed a finger at Liam. "What did you do to Nathaniel? Why won’t you tell us where he is?"

Liam slid his hands into his pockets, posture relaxed but voice razor-sharp. "I have no idea what you’re accusing me of. But if you keep harassing my boss, I won’t hesitate to remove you. Doesn’t matter if you’re a Whitmore or the damn queen."

Cassandra immediately shielded Eleanor, defiance in every line of her body.

"I knew it! You’re covering something up, and now you’re threatening us?" She lifted her chin. "Fine. Take me instead. But if you lay a finger on Mrs. Whitmore, I’ll make sure you regret it!"
###Chapter 441

"Bring it on, sweetheart. Just don't come crying to me later."

Liam was known as the "Demon King" of Newport City—a title even The Elite Eight families avoided provoking. He specialized in putting arrogant women like Cassandra in their place.

He cracked his knuckles with a chilling smirk. "Been a while since I last punched someone. Nothing quite like using a bitch's face as a punching bag. The sound of bones crunching? Pure satisfaction. And since you asked for it, I’ll enjoy this even more."

Exclusive content from N?velDrama.Org.

"D-Don’t you dare touch me! I’m part of the Delacroix family! Hurt me, and they’ll make sure you regret it!"

Cassandra had heard the rumors about Liam’s brutality.

Backed by the Osborne family’s influence, he was ruthless—untouchable. No one with any sense would provoke him.

She never expected this madman to still be so loyal to Isabella after all these years. Their scandal had faded, yet here they were, still inseparable.

If she’d known, she wouldn’t have defended Margaret so recklessly.

Now, if he really turned her face into pulp, the loss would be unbearable.

"Did I stutter? I don’t give a damn about your family name. Disrespect my boss, and you pay the price."

His fist slammed through the table, splintering wood. The impact left a gaping hole.

"Ah! Margaret, help me!" Cassandra shrieked, cowering behind her like a frightened turtle.

"Miss Whitmore, you volunteering to be next?" Liam flexed his fingers, grinning darkly.

This was just intimidation—a way to drive them off before they ruined Isabella’s mood.

If she found out about Nathaniel’s death now, her treatment would suffer. He couldn’t risk that.

Margaret, however, wasn’t so easily shaken. A true aristocrat of Harborview City, she’d faced worse than some brat’s empty threats.

She lifted her chin, sneering. "You’re nothing but Isabella’s lapdog. How dare you bare your teeth at me?"

Liam arched a brow. "Ah, the great Eleanor Whitmore—mother of Nathaniel Blackwood. How brave."

She scoffed. "I had my doubts before coming, but now I’m certain. You two set my son up!"

"And why’s that?"

"Lockhart Enterprises—your little pet project—has grown too fast. You got cocky, challenging Blackwood Group." Her voice dripped with venom. "You knew Nathaniel was finalizing the Quantum-6 chip deal with QuantumTech this month. Once signed, Blackwood Group would dominate the tech industry. So you sabotaged him. Pathetic."

Isabella sighed. "Really, Margaret? If we wanted to stop the deal, wouldn’t it make more sense to outbid QuantumTech instead of risking everything on some idiotic scheme?"
###Chapter 442

"You're overestimating yourself!"

Margaret's voice cut through the air like ice. "Do you even understand QuantumTech's standing in the tech industry? They've exclusively partnered with Blackwood Group for years. Do you really think a startup like yours can just waltz in and demand a collaboration?"

"Exactly!"

Cassandra, lurking behind Margaret, chimed in sharply. "Lockhart Enterprises isn't even in the same league as QuantumTech. You're not fit to lick their boots, let alone work with them. This whole scheme—hurting Nathaniel—was just your pathetic attempt to sabotage Blackwood Group's partnership!"

Liam nearly choked on laughter. "That's rich. I won't deny QuantumTech's prestige, but they're not untouchable. In fact, I happen to be on excellent terms with their CEO."

Cassandra scoffed. "Liar. Even Nathaniel barely had direct contact with him. What makes you think someone like you could?"

"I'm not lying. Ask Vivian—she can vouch for me. Right, Boss?" He shot Vivian a knowing look, eyebrows raised.

"Enough," Vivian said coolly. "Just find Nathaniel. Where the hell is he? I'm losing my patience."

"Stop playing dumb!" Cassandra snapped, turning to Margaret. "Miss Whitmore, we're wasting time. Let's call the police. They'll get the truth out of these two while we focus on finding Nathaniel!"

Margaret nodded. "You're right. Arguing won't solve anything. The authorities should handle this."

"No!" Liam's voice turned sharp. "Call the police, and I won't hold back."

His defiance only deepened their suspicions. Even Vivian felt uneasy.

"Listen to him," Cassandra sneered. "He's not even trying to hide his guilt anymore. Hurry, Miss Whitmore—call them. Let's see if his family's influence can save him now."

Vivian exhaled sharply. "Fine. If that's how it is, let the police settle this. I trust the system will clear our names." She reached for her phone.

Liam snatched it from her grip. "Don't. The fewer people involved, the better. And I doubt the Blackwoods want this scandal spreading either."

Vivian's eyes narrowed. "If you respect me, Liam, tell me the truth. What are you hiding?"

He hesitated. The truth would destroy her—and Margaret would collapse on the spot. Things would spiral out of control.

"Just say it!" Vivian hissed. "Your secrecy is making us look guilty!"

"Fine." Liam took a deep breath. "But brace yourself. Nathaniel's condition... it's worse than you think. He's—"

Before he could finish, Margaret's phone rang.

"What? Nathaniel—?"

Her face darkened as she listened, grip tightening around the device.

After a long silence, she hung up, her expression unreadable.
###Chapter 443

"What's wrong, Mrs. Whitmore? Any news about Nathaniel?" Vivian's voice trembled with urgency.

Margaret nodded stiffly, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Vivian's hands clenched the bedsheets. "Thank God! Where is he? What happened? Did he say who did this?"

The air grew heavy with tension.

She knew something terrible had occurred between her and Nathaniel. Dominic's defensive posture told her everything.

Now that Nathaniel had been found, she wouldn't let them get away with whatever they'd done.

After a long pause, Margaret spoke carefully. "Nathaniel is...fine. We were wrong about Mrs. Lockhart and Mr. Osborne."

"What?" Vivian and Dominic exclaimed in unison.

A quiet sigh escaped Vivian's lips. "At least he's safe."

Dominic would lie to protect her, but someone as shrewd as Margaret wouldn't hesitate to attack if Nathaniel were truly in danger. Since Margaret hadn't pounced, Vivian could breathe easier.

"Nathaniel wants you to focus on recovering," Margaret said icily. Her gaze was so sharp it could flay skin.

"This makes no sense!" Cassandra interjected. "The nurse said his condition was critical. Now he's suddenly fine? And it has nothing to do with them?" She seized the opportunity to stir chaos. "Who called you? Are you sure it wasn't a trick? We should call the police!"

Margaret's glare could freeze lava. "Do you want my son to be hurt?"

"N-no! I'm just worried—"

"Enough." Margaret cut her off sharply. "I decide when to involve the police." Her voice turned steely. "I will find who harmed my son. But I, Margaret Whitmore, don't accuse the innocent—nor do I let the guilty walk free."

With that, she strode out, Cassandra scrambling after her.

Vivian stared at the empty doorway long after they'd left.

Something wasn't right.

"Dominic," she said slowly. "You mentioned Nathaniel's condition was worse than amputation. What did you mean?"

"Margaret said he's fine. Stop overthinking." Dominic avoided her eyes. "We need to focus on Lockhart Enterprises. This mess has derailed everything."

He was just as confused about Nathaniel's sudden recovery, but the company's crisis took priority. If they failed now, all of Vivian's sacrifices would be for nothing.
###Chapter 444

Vivian's expression remained unreadable, her voice steady. "We proceed as planned."

Lockhart Enterprises had never bowed to Blackwood Group before. That wouldn't change now.

Blackwood Group had reigned long enough. It was time for a shift in power.

Liam's resolve hardened instantly. His gaze locked onto Vivian with near-reverence, as if she were the only force worth following.

"Everything's set, Boss. The press conference venue is ready."

"Every major outlet and competitor will be there. The entire country will witness Blackwood Group's downfall."

His excitement was palpable. They had waited years for this moment.

Failure wasn't an option.

Ethan's sudden disappearance had been... convenient.

With Blackwood Group in chaos, Lockhart Enterprises could finally claim its rightful place at the top.

But Liam hesitated.

"Boss... Ethan risked everything to save you. Does that... change anything?"

Vivian's laugh was sharp. "This was never about revenge. It's about securing my children's future."

"Though," she added dryly, "if we succeed, they'll be set for generations."

Liam grinned. "Understatement of the century."

Yet Vivian's fingers tightened around her glass.

Something felt off.

Too smooth. Too easy.

A warning prickled at the back of her neck.

Coral Haven, Southeast Paris

Abby slipped into Adrian's hidden lab while Evelyn wasn't looking.

Empty.

She locked the door and activated her smartwatch.

Adrian's face appeared seconds later—sunglasses, tiny suit, briefcase in hand.

"Brother! Mommy and Evelyn keep asking about you. If you don't come back soon—"

"I'm in Newport City," Adrian interrupted, adjusting his tie like a seasoned CEO. "Three days. That's all I need to finish this."

"But Mommy's hurt!" Abby blurted.

Adrian froze.

"Who. Hurt. Her." Each word was a blade.

His small hands clenched. "Find me the name. I'll bury them."
###Chapter 445

Abigail bounced on her toes, barely containing her excitement.

As Adrian's number one fan, she saw him as an invincible superhero. In her young mind, her brother was undoubtedly the strongest person alive.

Second place went to their kind and beautiful mother, Vivian.

And third? That spot belonged to the man they called The Rival - the one who'd made their strong mother cry.

"Brother, I think The Rival must be our bad daddy," Abigail blurted out suddenly, her wide eyes sparkling with realization. "Mommy's so powerful. Who else could hurt her?"

"Possible." Adrian nodded solemnly. Though only four years old, his sharp features already hinted at the striking man he'd become.

"I'll meet The Rival soon enough. If he really hurt Mommy..." His small hands clenched into fists. "He'll pay."

"But Brother," Abigail worried, "Mommy said he's really powerful. Can you beat him alone?"

"Of course." Adrian patted his briefcase confidently. "I've got everything I need right here. No one stands a chance."

"Good luck!" Abigail beamed, completely trusting in her brother's abilities. "I'll cover for you!"

Their secret meeting concluded.

Now Adrian stood before the towering Blackwood Group headquarters.

Using his hacking skills, he'd slipped away from Coral Haven days earlier and arrived safely in Newport City.

His plan was simple: infiltrate Blackwood Group's systems through the president's office.

"Mommy said The Rival runs Blackwood Group," Adrian murmured to himself, adjusting his glasses. "If I get those secret files, he'll have to listen to me."

Opening his briefcase, he pulled out a compact computer and began typing furiously.

The boy had inherited both Vivian's genius and Ethan's strategic mind. From birth, he'd shown an uncanny aptitude for technology, becoming a prodigy hacker under his mother's guidance.

His fingers flew across the keyboard as he worked from the building's public network access point. Just a few more minutes and he'd bypass all security.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The progress bar hit 80% when suddenly -

"Hey kid!" A security guard came running. "What are you doing here? Where are your parents? Scram!"
###Chapter 446

Adrian spotted the approaching man and smoothly slipped his tablet into his backpack.

He removed his sunglasses, revealing wide, golden eyes that gleamed like a tiger's. "Hello, sir! Nice to meet you!"

The guard's stern expression melted instantly. "Oh, what a polite young man!"

Adrian knew his innocent face was his greatest weapon. Few could resist it.

He blinked deliberately, letting his lashes flutter. "I'm waiting for my dad to finish work. It's so boring out here... all I can do is play games alone."

The guard's heart clenched. "That's unacceptable! Who's your father? Leaving a child unattended is irresponsible!"

Adrian sighed dramatically, pressing his fingertips together. "Daddy's very busy. I wish someone could take me to him..."

He ducked his head, feigning resignation. "But H Group is huge. A kid like me would never be allowed inside. If a bad person comes, I'll just run fast. Don't worry about me, sir."

The guard hesitated. Blackwood Group had strict security protocols.

Yet those pitiful eyes undid him. He grabbed Adrian's small hand. "You're too precious to leave outside. I'll take you to the lounge."

Adrian beamed. "You're so kind! I'll tell Daddy to give you a raise!"

The guard chuckled. "Generous little thing. Who is your father? The security chief? Or... Mr. Blackwood?"

His joking tone faded as he studied Adrian's face. The resemblance was uncanny.

"Wait... you look exactly like a mini Mr. Blackwood. Don't tell me you're his—"

Adrian shook his head quickly. "Who's Mr. Blackwood? My dad just works here."

"Right." The guard relaxed. "If you were his son, you'd have bodyguards. Come on, let's get you inside."

With the guard's escort, Adrian strolled into Blackwood Group unimpeded.

Simultaneously, his hacking program infiltrated every department.

The entire building was now his playground.

"Wait here, kiddo. I'll get you some snacks."
###Chapter 447

The security guard had just escorted Adrian to the VIP lounge when he rushed off to fetch refreshments.

He returned minutes later with a tray of pastries and fresh fruit, only to find the lounge completely empty.

Adrian had executed his escape flawlessly, avoiding every surveillance camera as he made his way to the top floor of Blackwood Group.

The entire floor belonged exclusively to Nathaniel Blackwood, housing only the CEO's office and private conference rooms.

The space was eerily quiet, almost deserted except for the occasional appearance of executives or Nathaniel's personal assistant.

With Nathaniel's recent absence, his staff had been drowning in urgent matters, leaving the floor practically abandoned.

Adrian approached the CEO's office door with confidence. His small fingers flew over the keypad as he effortlessly cracked the access code.

"Pathetic security," he muttered under his breath, shaking his head in disapproval. "Mom was right—this place is a joke."

Gritting his teeth, the determined boy pushed the heavy door open with all his might and marched inside.

Nathaniel's office was a monument to luxury and power, its vastness making Adrian appear minuscule in comparison.

"Perfect. The Rival isn't here," Adrian whispered to himself. "Now I can get what Mom needs."

True to his nature, Adrian immediately sprang into action. He climbed onto the massive leather chair and began meticulously examining the documents on Nathaniel's desk.

As CEO of Blackwood Group, Nathaniel maintained extreme security measures. His office contained highly sensitive materials that could cause catastrophic damage if they fell into the wrong hands.

Adrian rummaged through files and folders without success. Just as he was about to give up, a sealed envelope marked "CONFIDENTIAL" caught his eye.

"Is this it?" he wondered aloud, carefully opening the envelope to inspect its contents.

At that exact moment, Cassandra Delacroix burst through the partially open door, her face lighting up with excitement.

"Finally decided to show your face, Nathaniel? Where the hell have you been—"

Her words died in her throat as she spotted the small figure standing by the desk.

Her expression shifted through shock, confusion, and dawning realization.

"You...you're..."

The resemblance was uncanny. The boy before her looked exactly like childhood photos she'd seen of Nathaniel.

Everything clicked into place. William Carter had mentioned Vivian had two children—a boy named Adrian and a girl named Abigail.

"You must be Adrian," Cassandra said, masking her astonishment with forced calm.
###Chapter 448

Adrian set the envelope aside and studied Cassandra with calm precision. "Who are you? Why are in Uncle Nathaniel's office?"

His directness made Cassandra's stomach twist with guilt.

"I—"

The resemblance was undeniable. This boy had Nathaniel's piercing gaze and the same commanding presence that made people instinctively straighten their posture. He was undoubtedly a Blackwood.

"Adrian, I'm your mother's dear friend. You may call me Aunt Delacroix."

Cassandra softened her expression, taking slow steps toward him.

She was certain of one thing—this child belonged to Nathaniel. But the mother's identity remained unclear. With Nathaniel's status, countless women would kill to bear his heir. It might not be Isabella after all.

"You're Mommy's friend?"

Adrian's cherubic face scrunched in suspicion.

Mommy only ever mentioned Aunt Sophia. He'd never heard of any "Delacroix." But he recalled Aunt Sophia ranting about a viper named Cassandra—the woman who stole Daddy away.

Was this her?

"Absolutely. Your mother is Isabella, and you're Adrian, right? We've been inseparable for years. I even promised to be your godmother!"

Cassandra beamed, confident she could manipulate a four-year-old.

Adrian's dark eyes sparkled with sudden mischief. "Wow! Are you the famous Cassandra Delacroix Mommy talks about?"

Cassandra froze mid-step. "She... mentioned me?"

"Uh-huh! Mommy says Aunt Delacroix is the prettiest and kindest lady—even more than her!" Adrian hopped off the chair, arms outstretched. "And she was right! I like you so much!"

He barreled into her, wrapping small arms around her waist. Cassandra stiffened, thrown off balance.

'Isabella's spawn is hugging me? Claiming to adore me?'

That made zero sense. Their hatred was mutual and vicious. Isabella would never praise her, especially not to her child.

Something was off.

"Did... did your mother truly say those things?" Cassandra eyed the mop of dark hair pressed against her stomach.

Adrian tilted his head up, Nathaniel's exact eyes blinking innocently. "Yep! She said if I ever met you, I should hug you tight and never let go. That you'd take super good care of me."

Cassandra's lips parted soundlessly.

A war erupted inside her.

She loathed Isabella enough to watch her burn. By extension, she should despise this boy.

Yet those eyes—so much like Nathaniel's—made her traitorous heart waver. The maternal instincts she'd buried years ago stirred uncomfortably.

This child was disarmingly charming. And that terrified her.
###Chapter 449

"Aunt Delacroix, don't you like me?"

Little Adrian blinked his big, innocent eyes just like his sister Abigail always did. He put on his most adorable expression, mimicking the same tactic Briar used to gain trust.

He knew this woman had teamed up with The Rival to hurt Mommy.

Now it was his turn to teach her a lesson.

"I—"

Cassandra couldn't bring herself to say she disliked him the moment those puppy-dog eyes met hers.

"Aunt Delacroix, can you hug me? You remind me so much of Mommy! I really like you!"

Adrian beamed and grabbed her hand.

Cassandra was instantly disarmed. Against her better judgment, she cupped his soft, rosy cheeks.

"How could I not like you? You're absolutely precious!" She sighed. "Let me take you somewhere fun, okay?"

"Yay! You're the best!"

Adrian clung to her while secretly plotting his next move.

Cassandra couldn't resist squeezing his cotton-candy-like cheeks.

A pang of longing hit her. If her own baby had survived, he'd be about Adrian's age now. Would he have been this sweet? This cuddly?

For a fleeting moment, she wished Adrian were hers.

Then reality crashed back.

This brat was Isabella Lockhart's spawn. No matter how cute, he was still a bastard.

This was her golden opportunity—she couldn't waste it.

Taking a deep breath, Cassandra hardened her heart. "Adrian, did you come to Newport City with your mom? Who brought you here? Are you looking for your daddy?"

"Yes! I've never met him." Adrian played the perfect wide-eyed innocent. "Do you know where he is?"

"Your daddy happens to be my closest friend." Her smile turned icy. "He won't be coming here today... but I know exactly where to find him."

"Really? Can you take me to him, Aunt Delacroix?"

Adrian knew exactly what she was planning. He played along, amping up the pleading.

"Of course. Grab your things—we'll go right now."

Her grin grew predatory.

So easy. Children were so gullible.

Part of her genuinely adored this little boy—he was everything she'd dreamed her own child would be.

But fate had cursed him with the wrong mother.

Isabella Lockhart's son.

And now, before he could even meet his father, he'd fallen straight into her hands.

His life now depended on sheer luck.

A dark plan took shape in her mind.

Scooping him up, Cassandra slipped out of Blackwood Group unseen, avoiding every security camera.
###Chapter 450

Vivian Lockhart's leg had healed remarkably well over the past week. The doctors finally removed her cast, declaring her fit to leave the hospital.

Nathaniel Blackwood, Sophia Osborne, and William Carter arrived to take her home.

"Today's a special day," Sophia chirped, clapping her hands. "Our queen is finally free from that awful cast! We should celebrate properly."

Nathaniel, ever the perfectionist, had even brought a wheelchair—just in case.

"Absolutely," William agreed, grinning. "I've reserved a private dining room at The Gourmet Society. And there's a surprise waiting for you, Vivian."

Sophia winked, her excitement barely contained.

The moment they arrived at the restaurant, Vivian's eyes widened at the lavish spread. Her stomach growled—hospital food had been torture.

"Slow down," Nathaniel murmured, cutting her steak into precise pieces. His movements were careful, deliberate, as if she might shatter at any moment.

Vivian groaned. "Nathaniel, I hurt my leg, not my hands. I can feed myself."

She had spent weeks eating bland meals under strict supervision. Now, with a feast before her, she wasn't about to let anyone stop her.

"I'd rather choke than starve," she declared, shoving a large bite into her mouth—only to immediately regret it as she started coughing violently.

Nathaniel sighed, handing her a glass of water. "Told you."

Sophia fake-gagged. "Ugh, you two are disgustingly sweet. Nathaniel, since when did you turn into such a doting boyfriend?"

William chuckled. "I always thought older women had to baby their younger partners. But you? You’ve rewritten the rulebook."

Sophia blushed, playfully swatting his arm. "Stop it! You're embarrassing me."

Vivian, finally catching her breath, smirked. "Oh please. You two are way worse. Sophia, I never knew you could be this clingy."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "That's what love does to you. Unlike you and my brother—you act more like business partners than fiancés."

The comment stung.

Vivian knew their relationship wasn’t built on passion. But she had hoped, with time, affection would grow.

"Maybe you should take notes," Sophia teased. "Flirt a little. Be more... spontaneous."

Vivian hesitated.

How could she explain that she didn’t even know where to start?

"Ren," Sophia pressed, "if you keep this up, when will you two ever really connect?"

The question hung in the air, unanswered.
###Chapter 451

Sophia did everything she could to push them together.

William nodded enthusiastically. "Miss Lockhart, just try being playful with Mr. Blackwood," he urged.

"Trust me, no man can resist when you do that."

"Yeah, go for it!"

Sophia clapped excitedly, egging Vivian on.

But Vivian hesitated, standing frozen in place. Minutes passed, and she still hadn’t moved.

It wasn’t that she didn’t know how to be playful—she’d done it before. But with Nathaniel... she just couldn’t force herself.

Nathaniel saw her struggle. A flicker of hurt crossed his face, but he masked it instantly.

"Enough," he said sternly. "You two are getting too bold, joking about your elders like this. Do you still want that wedding to happen by the end of the month?"

His sharp tone silenced both Sophia and William.

Changing the subject, Nathaniel turned to Sophia. "Didn’t you say you had a surprise for Vivian? Where is it?"

"Patience," Sophia smirked, checking her watch. "Ten, nine, eight, seven..."

At "one," the restaurant erupted with upbeat music. A group of stunning young men took the stage, moving in perfect sync.

"Viv, meet the Nova Boys—Korshach’s hottest idol group. TV stations and businessmen have been begging for them, but I pulled some major strings to get them here just for you. This is their debut performance in our country. So? How’s the view?"

Sophia grinned, knowing exactly what Vivian liked.

No one understood Vivian better than her best friend.

Men enjoyed beautiful women—why shouldn’t women enjoy beautiful men?

The Nova Boys were flawless—tall, sculpted, and radiating charisma. Vivian was instantly mesmerized, jumping to her feet and cheering. "Yes! That move! You’re all so gorgeous! Look at those cheekbones!"

"Right? That silver-haired one—his lips look like they were made to be kissed!" Sophia gushed.

The two women huddled together, completely absorbed in the performance, their eyes sparkling with excitement.

In the corner, Nathaniel’s expression darkened, but he couldn’t make a scene—that would make him look petty.

William wasn’t thrilled either.

He’d only been playing along with Sophia for his mission. But seeing her drool over another man stirred something ugly inside him.

He needed to wrap this up fast—before he actually fell for her.

Unable to hold back, William grabbed Sophia’s chin, forcing her to look at him. "Sophia, stop. If you want a show, I’ll dance for you. No more staring at other men."

Nathaniel wanted to do the same to Vivian—but he had no right.

His love for her was so painfully humble that he couldn’t even claim the privilege of jealousy.

Then Vivian’s phone rang, shattering the moment.

"Miss Lockhart, something terrible has happened!" Evelyn’s panicked voice trembled through the speaker, her words nearly drowned by tears.
###Chapter 452

Vivian's pulse stuttered before she regained composure. "Evelyn, explain clearly," she demanded, voice tight with tension. "Take a breath and tell me exactly what happened."

"I had this awful feeling," Evelyn gasped between sobs. "When I checked Adrian's playroom, he was gone. I searched the entire Bali estate—nothing. He's just a little boy, Miss Lockhart. What if someone took him? What do we do?"

Her words came in broken fragments, each syllable laced with guilt. Vivian had entrusted the twins to her care, and this lapse felt unforgivable. The weight of failure pressed down until Evelyn could barely breathe.

Vivian's world tilted.

The phone nearly slipped from her grasp as the words struck like a physical blow. Adrian and Abigail were her reason for breathing, her anchors in every storm. Now one had vanished without a trace.

Her usual steel resolve shattered. In this moment, she wasn't the formidable CEO—just a terrified mother.

Nathaniel intercepted the spiraling panic. Taking the phone, his calm voice cut through the chaos. "Evelyn, pull up the security feeds. Check for notes. That boy's cleverer than most adults—he wouldn't go quietly. Stay sharp."

"R-right away!"

Evelyn scrambled toward the surveillance hub. Nathaniel had installed military-grade systems across the Bali property after the last threat. Motion sensors, panic buttons, a small army of ex-special forces guards—nothing should've penetrated their defenses.

Vivian's nails bit into her palms.

A realization struck. "Put Abigail on," she ordered, voice like tempered glass. Their daughter's recent behavior—the dodged video calls, the sudden clinginess—it all made terrible sense now.

Evelyn hesitated. "She's distraught, Miss Lockhart. It took hours to calm her—"

"Now."

The command brooked no argument. Abigail's theatrics couldn't fool her mother. That child was hiding something.

As Evelyn hurried off, William caught fragments of the crisis. He leaned toward Sophia. "The Lockhart child is missing?"

Sophia's warning glance held layers of meaning. "Not a word to anyone. Those twins are her entire world."

William's jaw tightened.

Something about this felt wrong. Deeply wrong.

"Abigail," Evelyn's voice carried through the speaker, gently insistent. "Your mother needs to speak with you. Wake up, sweetheart."
###Chapter 453

Vivian stepped into Abigail's pastel-colored bedroom where the little girl remained curled beneath her floral duvet.

"Mmm...ask me tomorrow. I'm sleeping now."

The small lump under the covers wriggled deeper into hiding.

Abigail knew her mother would demand answers, but she'd sworn to Adrian she'd never reveal his secret. Caught between two impossible choices, retreating seemed her only option.

"Sweetheart, this is important. Mommy needs to talk to you right now."

Evelyn attempted to coax the human burrito from its cotton shell, but the child had cocooned herself with impressive determination.

"No! I'm asleep already! Tell Mommy to call later!"

Fake snoring sounds followed this declaration. "See? Can't hear anything when I'm sleeping."

Evelyn wiped her brow in frustration after several failed attempts to unwrap her charge. "Miss Lockhart...perhaps you'd have better luck?"

Vivian's expression darkened as her patience wore thin.

Taking a sharp breath, she planted both hands on her hips. "Abigail Marie Lockhart!"

Like magic, the duvet flew back to reveal a flushed little face with enormous guilty eyes.

"Mommy! Don't be angry! I'll tell you everything!"

The child knew that tone meant business. When full names came out, consequences followed.

Her conscience wrestled briefly. Sorry, Adrian. Survival first.

Vivian's stern features softened marginally. "Good girl. Now tell me - where is your brother?"

"Promise you won't get mad at us first?"

Always the negotiator, this one.

"Of course not."

Vivian's smile didn't reach her clenched fists. Just wait until I get my hands on those little schemers.

"Adrian was worried bad people would hurt you in Newport City. So he...kind of...made a plan to protect you."

Abigail launched into a surprisingly coherent explanation of her brother's brilliant scheme. The admiration in her voice was unmistakable - to her, Adrian might as well have invented anti-gravity boots.

The details made Vivian's blood pressure spike. "He WHAT? He's in Newport City ALONE?"

She pressed two fingers to her forehead, willing herself not to faint from sheer parental terror. That boy would be grounded until college.
###Chapter 454

Those two little troublemakers had nerves of steel!

"Isabella Lockhart, just you wait. I'm bringing your brother home. Seems like it's been too long since I last taught you both a proper lesson. How dare you pull such a reckless stunt!"

Vivian was fuming, her rationality slipping as she clenched her fists so tightly her knuckles cracked audibly through the phone.

Abigail blinked her large, innocent eyes, the picture of angelic sweetness. "Mommy, didn't you promise not to get angry? Liars get wrinkles, you know. If you really want to punish someone, hit Adrian instead. I'll even lend you a ruler."

"You kept secrets from me! Of course you deserve a spanking!"

Vivian's patience had snapped. She was itching to march over and give Abigail the scolding of her life for this little act of defiance.

Her children were too clever for their own good—a dangerous combination.

Adrian had an IQ that could rival Einstein's, while Abigail's emotional intelligence made her a master manipulator. Together, they were an unstoppable duo, always scheming and framing her whenever they got the chance.

And Abigail? She worshipped the ground Adrian walked on. If he ever decided to commit murder, she'd be the one handing him the weapon without question.

"Abigail Lockhart, I am livid. Kneel. Now."

Vivian's voice was ice-cold as she issued the command through the video call.

The warm mother-daughter moment from earlier was long gone.

Thud. Abigail knew she'd messed up. She dropped to her knees instantly, her voice trembling with remorse. "Mommy, I'm sorry! Please don't be mad. I won't lie to you again..."

Her pitiful, teary-eyed expression could melt even the coldest heart.

Nathaniel, watching from the side, couldn't stand it. "Boss, she’s learned her lesson. Let her get up. Right now, we need to find Adrian before he gets into real trouble."

Vivian took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm. "Fine. Since you're sorry, I’ll give you one chance. Tell me—when was the last time you spoke to Adrian? Where is he now?"

Abigail sniffled, thinking hard before answering obediently. "Last night. He said he was going to Bad Daddy’s company to get that important document for you. He even said he’d teach those bullies a lesson! He’s so smart, he probably already made it. But... I tried calling him just now, and he didn’t pick up..."

"Blackwood Group?"

At first, Vivian wasn’t too worried. Her son was a prodigy—a three-year-old who once sailed a speedboat alone to Coral Haven. Now four, traveling to Newport City by himself wasn’t exactly shocking.

But why would he go straight to Nathaniel instead of her?

That... was a problem.

"Evelyn, keep an eye on Abigail. I need to go catch that little runaway!"

A bad feeling settled in Vivian’s gut as she ended the call, already heading for the door. She had to get to Blackwood Group—fast.

"Your leg isn’t fully healed yet. I’m coming with you."

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate, following close behind.

With Nathaniel temporarily out of commission, if Vivian showed up at Blackwood Group now, the truth about his condition would be exposed.

He couldn’t let her face that alone.

Meanwhile, Sophia and William stood frozen, stunned by what they’d just witnessed.

William’s jaw practically hit the floor. "Did I hear that right? Vivian’s kid crossed an ocean by himself to get here? And now he’s at Blackwood Group?!"

He turned to Sophia, desperate for confirmation.
###Chapter 455

"That appears to be the situation."

Sophia nodded, her demeanor far calmer than expected, as if incidents like this were nothing out of the ordinary.

"You're telling me a four-year-old traveled to Newport City alone?"

"Technically, he's four years and three months."

"But—how? He's a child. How did he manage that? Why aren't you more concerned? Aren't you worried he might run into dangerous people?"

"For most four-year-olds, this would be alarming. But not Adrian. This isn't his first time pulling something like this. He's escaped before. His mother would catch him and discipline him, but instead of stopping him, it just made him better at slipping away. At this point, it's impossible to keep him contained. My best friend has given up trying!"

A proud smile tugged at Sophia's lips as she spoke about her godson. Her confidence was unwavering.

"Besides, you don’t need to worry about him getting hurt. He’s more than capable. If anything, the people who cross him should consider themselves lucky if he doesn’t torment them."

Her concern wasn’t for Adrian—it was for Nathaniel. The boy had despised him since childhood, vowing to make him pay.

"Seriously? That kid is extraordinary. Is he… Mr. Blackwood’s son?"

William hesitated, testing the waters carefully.

Sophia, usually carefree, tensed instantly. Her eyes narrowed. "Why the sudden interest in my best friend? First, you ask where the kid is, now about his father. Are you investigating her background?"

William’s expression flickered with guilt. He cleared his throat. "You're jealous, aren’t you? I only ask because Miss Lockhart is your best friend. My concern for her stems from my concern for you."

"I’m not jealous. I’m warning you. Don’t even think about messing with her. If you dare hurt her, I’ll make sure you regret it."

Lately, Sophia had begun questioning William’s motives. He wasn’t as simple as he seemed.

She could handle being fooled—but she wouldn’t drag Vivian into it.

"Given recent events, I think we should take a break. Let’s stop seeing each other until things settle. That way, you won’t be tempted to act on any… ill intentions."

With that, she grabbed her bag and stood.

William panicked, seizing her wrist. "Are you breaking up with me? You’re accusing me without proof. Isn’t that unfair?"

"It’s temporary. Once Vivian’s situation is resolved, maybe I’ll reconsider."

Her tone was icy as she shook him off and strode out of the restaurant.

She had liked him—but his sudden interest in Vivian’s life raised too many red flags. For Vivian’s sake, she had to walk away.

"Wait!"

William watched her leave, an unexpected ache in his chest.

Only now did he realize—he’d fallen for her.

But what did that mean for Cassandra?

As he wrestled with the thought, his phone buzzed. Cassandra’s name flashed on the screen.

After a long pause, he answered.

"What took you so long?" Her voice was sharp, impatient. "Get to Harbor Market. I need you to deliver something."
###Chapter 456

The moment Vivian Lockhart and Liam Osborne stepped into Blackwood Group's headquarters, the tense atmosphere among employees erupted into chaos.

Everyone knew.

The veteran staff who'd worked there over four years remembered the heartbreaking love story between Vivian and their CEO. They'd all rooted for the couple they affectionately dubbed "Lockhart's Heart."

"She's here. After four years of waiting—Mrs. Blackwood is finally back. I knew they were endgame!"

"Damn. She’s even more stunning now. That figure, that presence… Honestly, Mr. Blackwood doesn’t deserve her."

"With Mr. Blackwood missing and the company in shambles, is Mrs. Blackwood here to take control?"

Whispers spread like wildfire. Some marveled at her commanding aura. Others speculated about her sudden appearance.

Vivian didn’t slow her stride. Her expression remained unreadable, cool and detached as she approached the front desk.

"Olivia," she said, voice steady. "Tell Ethan I need to see him."

The authority in her tone was undeniable. Gone was the soft-spoken woman from before—this was someone who demanded obedience.

Olivia Carter, the receptionist, tensed. She swallowed hard. "Mrs. Blackwood… welcome back. But Mr. Blackwood hasn’t been here for days. We can’t reach him. No one knows where he is."

Vivian’s eyes sharpened. "Missing?"

"Yes. We thought—maybe you had news?"

Olivia relaxed slightly. Vivian had always been kind to the staff, bringing treats and gifts. They’d loved her.

After a beat, Vivian nodded. If Ethan was injured worse than her, it made sense he wouldn’t be here.

"Then tell me," she pressed. "Have you seen a boy here recently?"

"A boy?"

Olivia brightened. "Oh! Yes—adorable, around four or five, wearing a checkered blazer? So handsome, I took a photo!"

"Show me. Now."

Olivia pulled up the picture—Adrian Lockhart, being led inside by a security guard.

"He said it was his nephew. The kid stayed in the lounge until his shift ended. I didn’t see when they left."

"Adrian."

Vivian’s breath caught. Her fingers tightened around the phone. Even if he could handle himself, this was Blackwood Group. If the wrong people realized who he was…

"Don’t worry." Liam rested a hand on her shoulder, then turned to Olivia. "Get that guard here. Now."
###Chapter 457

Vivian Lockhart had always been fiercely independent. She shot a defiant glance at Julian Montgomery before stating firmly, "My apologies. I answer only to Mr. Blackwood."

Her tone dripped with disdain. "Why should I take orders from someone like you?"

Olivia wasn't alone in her contempt. Every employee at Blackwood Group viewed Julian as a nuisance—the man who'd torn apart Vivian and Nathaniel's marriage. They'd do anything to see him gone.

Vivian inhaled deeply, steadying herself. "Please summon the security guard," she instructed Olivia calmly.

"Right away, Mrs. Blackwood." Olivia complied instantly.

In Blackwood Group, Vivian's authority often surpassed even Nathaniel's. Her commands were followed without hesitation—a testament to her natural leadership.

The security guard arrived in the lobby moments later.

The moment he spotted Vivian, he dropped to his knees. "Mrs. Blackwood, I swear I know nothing! I just brought the boy to the lounge out of kindness. I have no idea where he went or who took him. Whatever happened, it wasn't my fault!"

"Relax," Vivian said evenly. "I'm not here to blame you. I just need to understand what happened so we can find him."

The guard trembled, avoiding her gaze. "Y-yesterday, I saw a boy alone outside the building. When I asked about his parents, he said his father worked here. I took him to the lounge to wait... but when I turned around, he was gone. That's the truth, I swear!"

Panic laced his voice. He knew this child must be important, and he feared being implicated.

"So the last place you saw him was the Blackwood Group lounge?" Vivian confirmed.

"Yes! I went to get snacks, and when I returned, he'd vanished. I assumed his father had collected him."

"Understood. You may return to your post."

Convinced he was truthful, Vivian didn't press further. She turned to Olivia. "I need to review the surveillance footage."

Olivia hesitated. "The public areas, yes. But the restricted zones require Mr. Blackwood's authorization—and he's currently unreachable."

"Then start with what we can access."

The restricted areas posed no real barrier—Blackwood Group's security systems were child's play for someone of Vivian's skills.

They proceeded to the third-floor tech department. The footage confirmed Adrian's arrival, though the clever boy had dodged most cameras—until one critical slip.

A single frame caught him entering Nathaniel's private elevator to the executive floor.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Olivia said apologetically, "we can't access the presidential suite footage without—"

"That won't be necessary."

A deep voice interrupted from behind them. A tall, imposing figure stepped into view.
###Chapter 458

"Julian?"

Vivian Lockhart froze at the sight of the strikingly handsome man striding into the tech department. Her guard instantly went up, brows knitting together in suspicion.

Julian Blackwood wasn't someone to underestimate. Back when Vivian was still Mrs. Blackwood, he'd been the first to challenge her position, scheming against her at every turn.

As the grandson of Alfred Blackwood's brother, he was technically Nathaniel's younger cousin. He'd been managing Blackwood Group's overseas operations, which made his sudden return to Newport City all the more puzzling.

"Mr. Blackwood!"

Olivia and the other employees immediately bowed their heads, their breaths hitching as if they'd just encountered death itself.

Clearly, Julian commanded significant respect within Blackwood Group despite always playing second fiddle.

"Vivian, it's been years. You're even more breathtaking now."

Dressed in a tailored dark suit that screamed power, Julian let his gaze roam over Vivian shamelessly, a smirk playing on his lips. "Marriage suits you. You've got this... irresistible allure now."

Liam's temper flared. He stepped protectively in front of Vivian, his expression icy. "Watch your mouth, Mr. Blackwood. She's not your sister-in-law anymore. One more word out of line, and I'll have you in court."

Julian arched a brow, amused. "My apologies. I forgot it's been four years since Ms. Lockhart's divorce. But to me, she'll always be family. Even if she's no longer tied to Nathaniel, I still consider her my sister-in-law. We have... much to catch up on."

His eyes locked onto Vivian again, undeterred.

"Stop staring at her!"

Liam's fists clenched, his patience snapping. "If you can't control where your eyes wander, I'll gladly teach them some manners."

Julian had always been vile.

Riding on his status as second only to Nathaniel in the Blackwood family, he'd acted like untouchable royalty across Newport City.

He'd openly opposed Vivian's marriage to Nathaniel, claiming she wasn't worthy. He'd even hired thugs to crash their wedding, humiliating her publicly.

Alfred had been furious, stripping him of power and exiling him overseas with only minor business dealings to manage. That had kept him in check—until now.

Liam had never forgotten that incident. He'd longed to punch Julian's smug face, and now fate had handed him the perfect opportunity.

"It's fine."

Vivian placed a calming hand on Liam's arm. "Beauty attracts attention. If Mr. Blackwood enjoys looking, I'll take it as a compliment. Stare all you want."

Liam scowled. "Boss, how can you let this creep get away with it? Remember what he did to you?"

"People change. I believe he can be... useful to us now."

Vivian's gaze locked onto Julian, her smile laced with hidden meaning.

"See? She gets it!"

Julian looked pleasantly surprised.

It was true. Vivian had transformed from that rigid, conservative woman into someone entirely different.

"Ms. Lockhart, I heard you wanted access to the presidential suite's surveillance footage. Nathaniel denied your request, but... I happen to have his authorization. Maybe I can help."

His tone dripped with smugness.

Vivian remained unfazed. "By all means, Mr. Blackwood. Do enlighten us."

Even without his help, she had other ways to hack into that system.
###Chapter 459

She could save herself the trouble since he'd offered to help.

Ethan had always been meticulous about Blackwood Group's authorizations. He'd never shown his cousin any kindness.

His sudden decision to hand over full control to someone so unreliable made Vivian question his motives. Was he being careless, or was there more to it?

She knew Blackwood Group held the key to Lockhart Enterprises' survival. This was her chance to extract the truth from Julian.

After all, Julian seemed like a fool who'd spill everything with minimal prompting.

"I can help you, but I have one small request."

Julian's lips curled into a sly smile as he spoke slowly.

Vivian raised an eyebrow. "Name it."

"I want you to spend the night with me."

The room erupted in shocked gasps.

He clearly had no respect for Ethan whatsoever.

Liam's fist clenched Julian's collar, fury radiating from him. "You bastard! How dare you insult Vivian like this!"

This wasn't Julian's first offense. He'd made similar crude remarks when Vivian was still his sister-in-law.

Back then, he'd simply wanted to humiliate her - to prove she wasn't good enough for Ethan. But now... his interest seemed genuine.

"Liam, stand down."

Vivian stopped him, then turned to Julian. "Are you serious? You actually dare to ask me that?"

Julian chuckled. "Others would kill for this opportunity. Why wouldn't I dare?"

"An opportunity?" Vivian smirked. "We'll see if you're lucky enough to handle it."

"Now you've really got me excited." Julian's eyes gleamed with newfound interest.

The once-reserved Mrs. Blackwood had changed. Flirting so boldly with someone like Julian? The employees exchanged shocked glances.

Liam understood Vivian's game. He forced himself to step back, fists still clenched. Julian had walked into the lion's den - he'd regret this.

Getting that surveillance footage of Adrian was what mattered most.

With Julian's authorization, they accessed the presidential suite's security feed.

What they saw left them utterly speechless.
###Chapter 460

The surveillance feed abruptly cut to an episode of Pinky Pig the moment Adrian stepped into the CEO's private elevator.

For over an hour, the cartoon played on loop before the footage finally reverted to normal.

But Adrian was nowhere to be seen.

Someone had deliberately spliced the Pinky Pig clip over that segment of the recording.

"Security breach?" A technician paled. "Did someone hack into Blackwood Group's surveillance system?"

"Our firewalls are impenetrable," another muttered, sweat beading on his forehead. "Whoever did this is terrifyingly skilled. The boy might be in serious danger."

"Assemble the crisis team immediately. We need to report this to cybercrime—this isn't something we can handle alone."

The entire tech department stared at the looping cartoon with mounting dread, their professional pride in tatters.

Meanwhile, Vivian Lockhart massaged her temples in exasperation.

She recognized her son's handiwork instantly.

Adrian Lockhart, you little devil.

Not only had he sneaked into Newport City alone, but he'd also deployed counter-surveillance tactics against her.

Just wait till I get my hands on you.

Her fingers curled into fists.

Nathaniel Blackwood sighed, equally resigned. "Boss, should we involve the authorities?"

"Absolutely not."

Vivian's tone brooked no argument. "This stays in-house."

The last thing she needed was Adrian's identity leaking to the press. The twins' existence was her most closely guarded secret.

Liam Osborne nodded. "Understood. I'll mobilize our networks. Finding one boy shouldn't be—"

"He doesn't want to be found."

Vivian exhaled sharply. "You know how he is. That child has outmaneuvered me at every turn for years. Unless he decides to surface himself, we're chasing shadows."

A reluctant chuckle escaped Liam.

If Vivian was a genius, then Adrian and Abigail were prodigies that defied logic.

The only person who'd ever outsmarted Vivian Lockhart was her own offspring.

Searching all of Newport City would be futile if Adrian chose to vanish.

From the sidelines, Julian Blackwood observed their whispered exchange with narrowed eyes.

Though he couldn't catch every word, their intimacy matched the rumors perfectly.

His lips twisted into a cold smirk. "Miss Lockhart, you've seen the footage. Time to honor our agreement."

Vivian met his gaze squarely. "I keep my promises. Name your terms."
###Chapter 461

Julian's eyes lit up like a gambler hearing the roulette wheel finally spin.

"Relax," he purred, adjusting his cufflinks. "I'm not some depraved monster. No unspeakable acts required. Just accompany me to a private location for... conversation."

Liam's fist collided with the wall beside Julian's head before anyone could blink. "If you're not a predator, then the word has no meaning!" The veins in his neck stood out like cables. "I've watched you circling her for months. Touch one hair on her head and I'll skin you alive."

Julian didn't flinch. His smirk deepened. "Empty threats bore me. Do it now or forever hold your peace." He leaned into the pressure of Liam's forearm against his throat. "Though we both know she'd never forgive you for damaging her precious business partner."

Security guards hovered uselessly at the periphery. Nobody interfered with Harborview City's most dangerous heir.

Vivian's voice sliced through the tension. "Liam. Control yourself." Her glare could have frozen lava. "We've discussed your temper. This behavior is unacceptable."

For the first time in years, Liam didn't immediately obey. His knuckles whitened around Julian's collar. "Tell me you're not actually considering this."

"A deal is a deal." Vivian's tone brooked no argument. "Mr. Blackwood's terms are reasonable. I suggest you remember whose judgment you've trusted all these years."

Liam released Julian with a shove that sent him stumbling. "Reasonable?" A bitter laugh escaped him. "You'd really spend the night with this viper?"

The office collectively held its breath.

Vivian's chin lifted. "Business requires certain... accommodations. Surely after eight years, you understand that."

Tears glittered in Liam's eyes, making them eerily beautiful. "And your fiancé? Does he understand?"

Gasps rippled through the staff. The Lockhart-Osborne engagement was supposed to be secret.

Julian's amusement visibly grew. He crossed his arms, enjoying the spectacle.

"This isn't a middle school crush!" Vivian snapped. "Grow up. You know exactly why I'm doing this."

Liam's expression hardened into something unrecognizable. "Oh, I understand perfectly." He stepped back, voice dropping to a lethal calm. "But here's your choice—walk out with him tonight, and consider our engagement terminated."

The ultimatum hung in the air like a guillotine blade.
###Chapter 462

Vivian pressed trembling fingers to her temples. A bone-deep weariness settled in her chest. "This isn't something you should be asking me," she whispered, voice breaking.

Nathaniel had always understood her better than anyone. Why would he force this impossible choice now?

The light in Nathaniel's striking blue eyes flickered out like a dying candle. His shoulders slumped in defeat.

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Fine, Isabella. Don't answer. I already know." His voice cracked on the last word.

"Nat, please—" She reached for him, but he stepped back.

"Enough." He schooled his features into a mask of calm, though his jaw remained tight. "Consider our engagement over. From now on, think of me as your brother. I'll still support you, but I won't chain you to promises made under duress."

Each syllable carved another piece from his heart.

But what choice did he have?

Their relationship had become a gilded cage. No matter how hard they tried, happiness remained just out of reach.

This was his final gift to her—freedom.

"Are you... breaking up with me?" Vivian's voice rose in panic. Her fingers dug into his forearm. "I spoke without thinking. I choose you—only you. Don't leave."

The plea tore from her throat, raw and desperate.

Nathaniel had been her anchor through every storm. Without him, how would she navigate the darkness ahead?

Tears glistened in his eyes as he peeled her fingers away one by one. "You'll soar higher without me weighing you down. If you choose me tonight, you'll regret it tomorrow." His breath hitched. "So let me be the villain here."

He turned sharply, shoulders rigid. Only the glint of moisture on his cheeks betrayed his anguish.

Vivian stood frozen as he disappeared into the crowd.

Around them, employees wiped their eyes. A few muffled sobs broke the silence.

'God, a man like that—successful, devoted, willing to walk away for her happiness...'

The collective sigh was almost audible.

"Ms. Lockhart," Julian Blackwood purred, stepping closer. "You seem reluctant to let him go. Shall I call him back?"

"Do you want me to?" Vivian arched a brow, masking her turmoil with practiced ease.

"Not at all." Julian's smile turned predatory as he offered his arm. "Now that you're single... how about that private tour I promised? I know just the place to... distract you."
###Chapter 463

Vivian gave a cool nod. "Why are we standing around? Let's move!"

Arm in arm, they walked out past all the Blackwood Group employees.

The staff exchanged disappointed glances.

"Can you believe how different Mrs. Blackwood is now? Four years changed her completely. That sweet, innocent woman is gone. No shame at all - flirting with every man she meets!"

"This proves Nathaniel and Vivian's love story is dead. I can't stand her reckless behavior. She doesn't deserve Mr. Blackwood's loyalty. He's remained faithful all these years while she throws herself at womanizers like Julian. Poor man..."

"Don't just pity Mr. Blackwood. Think about Liam too! That poor boy's caught in the middle!"

The employees' admiration for Vivian had evaporated. One muttered, "Did you hear? Mr. Blackwood's absence isn't just business. He's seriously injured - because of her."

"Worse - my source says the rescue mission failed. Mr. Blackwood might be..."

"What? You think Julian would actually replace him? That's terrifying! Mr. Blackwood may be tough, but he's got class. Julian's nothing but a cockroach. If he takes over Blackwood Group, I'm resigning!"

Their heated discussion froze when a sharp voice cut through.

"Don't you people have work?"

The speaker had been absent as long as Nathaniel - Ethan Young, CEO's secretary.

"M-Mr. Young!"

Instant silence fell.

As Nathaniel's right-hand man, Ethan commanded nearly equal respect. His presence often felt like the CEO himself had arrived.

"What's this gossip session about?" Ethan's brow furrowed.

Returning after weeks away, the company's state alarmed him.

"Sir, we were discussing..." The boldest employee recounted everything, including Julian's inappropriate behavior with Vivian.

"Mr. Young, if Mr. Blackwood's alright, please bring him back. Julian's making unauthorized moves, clearly angling for control. And today... today he dared lay hands on Mrs. Blackwood!"

This particular employee had been a staunch supporter of Nathaniel and Vivian's romance. His frustration poured out.

"That bastard touched his cousin's wife? He's got a death wish." Ethan's fists clenched.

"Sir... about Mr. Blackwood..." Another dared ask, "Why his long absence? The rumors are damaging our reputation!"

"Some questions shouldn't be asked. Since when do employees demand their CEO's personal details?" Ethan's glare silenced further inquiries. Then thoughtfully, "Where did Mrs. Blackwood and Julian go?"
###Chapter 464

The sleek silver Bugatti Veyron roared down the empty highway like a beast unleashed.

Vivian Lockhart sat motionless in the passenger seat. She knew Julian Blackwood behind the wheel was dangerous, that this midnight drive was likely a trap. Yet her expression remained unreadable.

She wasn't always confident facing others, but dealing with reckless rich boys like Julian? That was practically her specialty.

Pulsing rock music filled the car's interior.

Julian was in high spirits, his grin nearly splitting his face. One hand rested lazily on the steering wheel while the other drummed against the window frame in perfect rhythm. The passing streetlights cast an amber glow over his sharp features, making him look almost...

For a fleeting moment, Vivian thought she saw a ghost of Nathaniel Blackwood in Julian's profile. The resemblance was uncanny.

"If you haven't slept, if I haven't stopped chasing, if being awake is a crime..."

Julian sang along with the radio, his voice surprisingly melodic. His carefree swaying to the music made him seem younger, more vibrant.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "You've got decent pipes, Mr. Blackwood. Sunset Drive's songs sound simple but are murder on vocal ranges. Most people end up sounding like wounded alley cats."

Julian's grin widened. He shot her a sideways glance. "Coming from you? That's high praise. Though between us, I still think you're the better singer."

Vivian stiffened. "You've heard me sing?"

"More than that." Julian's expression turned uncharacteristically serious. "Azure Tide was leagues above these new bands - Sunset Drive, Twilight Ride, Crimson Wave. They had real soul. Shame they disbanded."

Vivian's fingers twitched against her thigh. "You know Azure Tide?"

"Anyone who loves rock does." Julian's eyes gleamed with genuine admiration. "That lead singer? Voice like liquid gold. When she sang, it wasn't just music - it was pure emotion."

Without warning, Julian launched into an impassioned rendition of Azure Dream, his voice dropping into a surprisingly rich baritone.

Vivian's breath caught. Against her will, her lips parted as she harmonized: "You're my long-lost child, running by that glowing shore..."

Julian's eyes lit up like a fan meeting their idol. "Yes! That's the magic! Your voice brings the song to life!" He looked ready to whip out a lighter and wave it in the air.

Vivian abruptly stopped singing, shaking her head. "Ancient history. Azure Tide's gone. You should find a new band to obsess over."

Julian's gaze turned intense. "The band lives as long as its soul survives. And you, Vivian Lockhart, will always be Azure Tide's beating heart."

The car slowed as Julian completely abandoned paying attention to the road, his focus entirely on her.
###Chapter 465

Vivian Lockhart could never have imagined that her cousin-in-law, Julian Blackwood, who constantly belittled her at every turn, was secretly her biggest fan!

The revelation was utterly surreal.

"So you're telling me you knew about me even before I married your cousin? And you're actually a fan of Azure Tide?" Vivian's voice trembled with disbelief, yet she needed confirmation.

Azure Tide had been her college passion project - a band formed with fellow lab mates during their university days at Stanford. Contrary to their scientific reputations, they'd all shared a rebellious love for music.

Vivian had been the creative force behind the group - writing lyrics, composing melodies, and blessed with a voice that could melt stone.

Their journey began with uploading original tracks online. The viral response led to underground club performances, each show selling out as their following exploded.

Now that she thought about it, remaining unmarried would've been far more glamorous. Nothing compared to the adrenaline rush of performing under spotlights, bouquets raining at her feet.

But family circumstances changed. Her marriage to Nathaniel Blackwood forced Azure Tide's abrupt dissolution. Her former bandmates now dominated their respective research fields.

Those golden days existed only as fading memories... until Julian unearthed them.

"Of course I knew you," Julian confessed, his usual smirk replaced by rare sincerity. "You were purity incarnate back then - an untouchable goddess. I'd wake up guilty after dreaming about you!"

Vivian burst into laughter. "Mr. Blackwood, spare me the theatrics. This romantic delusion doesn't suit you. Do you hear how absurd you sound?"

"You doubt me?" Julian's expression darkened. He tapped his car's display, pulling up an extensive archive of Azure Tide performances - every song, every show.

Most shocking were the countless photos he'd taken of Vivian mid-performance, each capturing her radiance from perfect angles only a true fan would recognize.

"This is... unbelievable!" Vivian gasped.

As she scrolled through the footage, memories flooded back - a time before Nathaniel, when her parents still lived, when the Lockhart name commanded respect. When she could pursue both science and art without consequence.

Now only scars remained from her ill-fated marriage, the wounds superficially healed but still throbbing beneath the surface.

"Here's what I don't understand," Vivian studied Julian closely. "If you were such an admirer, why the constant hostility? The insults? The public humiliations? Are you clinically bipolar?"

After this brief interaction, her perception of him had already shifted. Perhaps he wasn't the irredeemable scoundrel she'd assumed. Perhaps he was simply... complicated.
###Chapter 466

Vivian had to force herself not to appear too curious. She remained silent in the passenger seat.

The traffic thinned as they entered the suburban outskirts. Darkness swallowed the surroundings. Not a single streetlight illuminated the desolate road. The atmosphere grew more unsettling with each passing second.

This was exactly the kind of place where terrible things happened.

But Vivian wasn’t afraid. Even with her legs freshly healed, she could take on ten more Julians if necessary.

"Where the hell are you taking me?" Her patience was wearing thin. Irritation laced her voice.

"Patience. We’re almost there." Julian turned onto a narrow, pitch-black path. Towering cypress trees lined both sides, their silhouettes sharp against the night sky.

Vivian rolled down the window, scanning the area. Why did this place feel familiar?

Then it hit her.

This was the cemetery where she and Ethan had fallen and gotten injured.

Rumors claimed this was an elite burial ground—those interred here supposedly lived luxuriously in the afterlife. But for the living, lingering too long risked encountering something unholy. Most considered it taboo.

Why would Julian bring her to such a cursed place in the dead of night? Her cast had just come off. She wasn’t about to risk another fall.

"Turn the car around." Her voice was ice. "I don’t like it here. Do it now."

Julian smirked. "I’m the one driving. What if I refuse?"

"Then don’t blame me for what happens next." In one swift motion, she pressed a switchblade against his throat. "We’re in the middle of nowhere. More ghosts than people. If you push me, I’ll slit your throat and bury you right here."

Julian wasn’t scared. If anything, he looked exhilarated. His eyes gleamed as he stared at her. "Then do it. I’d gladly die by your hand."

"You think I won’t?"

"Of course you will. If it’s too hard, I’ll help." He grabbed her wrist and yanked the blade deeper into his neck. Blood welled instantly.

Vivian jerked back, furious. "Are you insane? If you want to die, do it on your own time. Don’t drag me into your madness!"

Her grandfather had gifted her this Swiss knife—razor-sharp, capable of slicing through steel. Compact but lethal. She’d carried it for years, rarely needing to use it.

There was an old saying: Once a blade like this was drawn, it had to taste blood, or it would dull.

Julian, the madman, had fulfilled that superstition. His blood wasn’t spilled in vain.

"Enough games. If this was a joke, it’s over. I’m not playing along." She sheathed the knife and reached for the door. Locked.

"We haven’t reached our destination. Why the rush? All this driving would be wasted." Julian chuckled, restarting the engine.

Blood still trickled down his neck, staining his collar. He didn’t even flinch.

"Aren’t you going to stop the bleeding?" Disgust dripped from her words as she glared at him.

A man grinning in the darkness, driving through a remote graveyard, his shirt soaked in red—it was nothing short of deranged.
###Chapter 467

Julian's lips curved into a wider grin. His eyes sparkled as they locked onto Vivian's face. "Are you concerned about me?"

Vivian said nothing.

"If losing some blood makes you care, I'd gladly lose my head just to see that worried look on your face," he continued.

"Drop dead!" Vivian rolled her eyes before flinging a handkerchief at him.

Julian caught it mid-air, bringing the fabric to his nose for an exaggerated inhale. With theatrical reluctance, he pressed it against his bleeding neck. "Such fine linen. What a waste," he sighed dramatically.

"You're completely insane!" Vivian massaged her temples, regretting every life choice that led her here.

She'd initially thought Julian was just another spoiled rich boy - easy to manipulate for information about Blackwood Group. But the joke was on her. This man wasn't dumb. He was dangerously unhinged.

Playing along had backfired spectacularly, even causing tension between her and Liam.

'Biggest mistake of my life.'

This lunatic couldn't be reasoned with. Her only option was to wait until they reached their destination before making a break for it.

The car turned left, pulling up to an expansive platform.

"We've arrived." Julian cut the engine, turning to Vivian with an unsettling smile. "Trust me. You'll thank me for bringing you here."

"Yeah, I'm sure I will," Vivian replied with forced cheer, already calculating her escape.

She watched Julian exit the vehicle and followed suit. The moment he stepped toward her, she drove her foot into his stomach and snatched the keys from his grasp.

"Bedtime. No more games. Enjoy your creepy platform - I'm leaving." Vivian slid into the driver's seat, turning the ignition.

Julian coughed up blood from the impact but looked more exhilarated than ever. He licked the crimson from his lips. "Running away so soon? Isn't my charming cousin Nathaniel reason enough to stay?"

Vivian's foot froze on the brake. "Explain. Now."

"Haven't you wondered?" Julian propped himself up on one elbow, blood staining his teeth. "Two weeks without a single public appearance from Nathaniel Blackwood. Suddenly I'm recalled from overseas to handle Blackwood affairs. Doesn't that strike you as... curious?"

"H-He was injured. Probably recovering." Vivian's voice wavered. The pieces were forming a picture she refused to see.

"Just recovering? Is that what you really believe?"

"W-What else could it be?" Her hands trembled on the steering wheel.

Nathaniel was indestructible. Nothing could take him down. She repeated this like a mantra.

Julian's laugh sent chills down her spine. "You already know the answer, don't you?"
###Chapter 468

Vivian shook her head violently. "I don't have an answer for you, Julian. And I refuse to play your twisted mind games." Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel. "Move. Now. Or I swear I'll drive right through you."

Julian Blackwood lounged against the hood of her car, completely unfazed. A smirk played on his lips. "I expected you to be stronger after all these years. Yet here you are—still running from the truth. Pathetic, really."

"You're delusional!" Vivian snapped. "Last warning. Get out of my way!"

Her foot hovered over the accelerator. One hard press, and Julian would be nothing but a red stain on the pavement.

He chuckled darkly. "Do you really think killing me will change anything? My dear cousin is still dying, Vivian. Running me over won't save him."

Julian pushed off the car and gestured grandly at their surroundings. "Beautiful spot, isn't it? The Blackwoods picked it themselves. Perfect feng shui for eternity." His grin turned vicious. "Once they bury Ethan here, the great Nathaniel Blackwood will be trapped in this dirt forever—"

Vivian's vision blurred. The words "dying cousin" echoed in her skull like a death knell.

No. Impossible. Ethan didn't die. Men like him didn't just—

"See for yourself." Julian pointed to the massive marble tomb ahead. "They've even engraved your name beside his. How poetic—the devoted wife joining him in death." He barked a laugh. "Life's hilarious, isn't it? Doesn't matter how powerful someone is. In the end, we're all just corpses waiting to happen."

With deliberate cruelty, Julian ground his heel into Ethan's photograph on the tombstone.

"Where's that famous Blackwood pride now, cousin? Can't fight back from six feet under, can you?" Spittle flew from Julian's lips as decades of resentment boiled over. "Ninety-nine percent on my bar exams got me beaten bloody because you scored perfect. Built NovaTech into the top three—only to get exiled because you whispered in Grandfather's ear!"

He kicked the tombstone hard. "They called me the family disgrace. But how could I ever measure up to Saint Ethan?" Julian's voice cracked with manic glee. "Finally. Finally, you're the one lying in the dirt while I take everything—including her."

"STOP!"

Vivian didn't remember exiting the car. She stood between Julian and the desecrated grave, chest heaving. "You're stomping on a dead man's memory. Have you no decency?"

Julian's eyes glittered with malice. "What's wrong, Vivian? Feeling guilty?"
###Chapter 469

Julian Blackwood lifted his polished leather shoe and turned his body sideways to face Vivian Lockhart. A cruel smirk twisted his lips. "Gentleman? That was never part of my vocabulary, darling."

He took a deliberate step forward, crushing fallen leaves beneath his heel. "I've always been the family disgrace. Surely you've heard the stories." His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "Couldn't touch Ethan when he was breathing, but now? Now I can trample his memory into the dirt."

Vivian's emerald eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "You're insane. Even in death, Ethan was ten times the man you'll ever be!"

Something dangerous flickered in Julian's gaze. He closed the distance between them with predatory grace. "Really? Where is your mighty husband now?" He gestured mockingly at the marble tombstone. "My footprints stain his grave while I take what was his. He watches helplessly - is that your definition of strength?"

The slap echoed through the cemetery. Vivian's palm connected with Julian's cheek with enough force to snap his head sideways. "You disgusting pig! Never in your pathetic life will you lay a finger on me!"

Rage burned through her veins. Before Julian could react, her knee drove into his abdomen with brutal precision.

Julian crumpled to his knees before Ethan's grave, gasping for air. Vivian didn't hesitate - her designer boot pressed between his shoulder blades, forcing his forehead against the cold stone.

"This," she hissed, applying pressure, "is where you belong. At your betters' feet. Need another lesson in humility?"

A choked laugh escaped Julian. "Harder," he rasped, voice thick with perverse delight. "God, I love when you fight back."

Even through the pain, his eyes shone with manic intensity. "You want to know why I worshipped you then tore you down?" He licked blood from his split lip. "Because you betrayed yourself."

Vivian's grip faltered.

"You were lightning in human form," Julian continued, words dripping with venomous admiration. "A goddess walking among mortals. Then you shackled yourself to that emotionless machine." His sneer turned vicious. "Dismantled Azure Tide. Played the perfect little society wife for a man who couldn't love you. Watching you degrade yourself was worse than any insult I could invent."

Vivian recoiled as if struck. "You're sick."

"Am I?" Julian's laughter held no warmth. "Ethan's gone, Vivian. The Blackwood Empire will be mine soon. Why cling to ghosts when I can give you everything?"

She increased the pressure on his spine. "I don't need handouts. And Ethan isn't dead - that's your twisted fantasy!"

"Ask Dominic Harrington then." Julian's grin turned feral despite his position. "If he'll still speak to you, that is."

Two birds with one stone - his two greatest rivals eliminated in a single night. The thought sent electric pleasure coursing through his veins. This victory tasted sweeter than any boardroom conquest.
###Chapter 470

Vivian didn't have the patience to deal with Julian any longer. She spun on her heel and slid into the driver's seat.

The car tires screeched as she sped away from the cemetery.

She deliberately avoided glancing at Ethan's supposed grave.

In her heart, she knew with absolute certainty that he was still breathing.

Moonlight bathed the city streets as Vivian raced back to Sophia's downtown apartment.

The day's events had drained her completely. Her eyelids felt like lead weights.

All she craved was oblivion in the form of deep, dreamless sleep.

The moment she pushed open the door, two figures came into view - Sophia and Liam.

Their gazes locked, tension crackling between them after their explosive confrontation at Blackwood Group earlier.

"Vivian! Thank God you're safe." Sophia rushed forward, gripping her arm. "Liam was about to file a missing person report."

She studied Vivian's exhausted face. "When was the last time you ate? Let me fix you something."

Vivian shook her head weakly. "Not hungry. Just... so tired." Her words slurred slightly. "Need to sleep."

Without another word, she brushed past Liam toward the guest room.

"Sleep?" Sophia's eyes narrowed as she watched Vivian's unsteady retreat.

This wasn't normal behavior. Not after Adrian's disappearance.

The Vivian she knew would be tearing the city apart right now, not collapsing into bed.

"Did Julian do something to you?" Sophia demanded, blocking Vivian's path. "You're acting strange."

She shot a meaningful look at Liam. They both knew Julian was the reason for their breakup.

It burned Sophia that after everything Liam had sacrificed, some scheming cousin could destroy their relationship.

If it had been Ethan who won Vivian's heart, she could accept that. But Julian? Unforgivable.

She'd planned to give Vivian a piece of her mind, but the hollow look in her friend's eyes stopped her.

"Tell us what happened," Sophia insisted, hands on hips. "We'll make him pay if he hurt you."

Vivian's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Since when do I need protection from the likes of Julian?"

Sophia frowned. That much was true - Vivian could handle herself against ten Julians.

"Then what is it? Did you get news about Adrian?" Her voice softened with concern.

"Not about Adrian." Vivian's shoulders slumped. "Just... need to stop thinking for a while."

Her breathing grew shallow, each word more labored than the last. This wasn't the fierce woman they knew.

"I'll be fine after some rest." The forced smile didn't reach her eyes as she grasped the doorknob.

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Liam and Sophia exchanging worried glances in the silent apartment.
###Chapter 471

"I don't buy it!" Sophia's voice trembled with concern. She whirled to face Liam. "Do something, Liam. Now."

Vivian must have gone through something horrific. Nothing else could explain this broken version of her.

"You two might be over, but that doesn't mean you get to shut her out. You waited all night to talk when she came back, didn't you? So why the silence now?"

Sophia had always been impulsive. Without hesitation, she shoved Liam into Vivian's room and slammed the door shut. The lock clicked ominously from the outside.

Liam immediately panicked, rattling the doorknob. "Sophia, open this damn door right now!"

"Not happening. Fix whatever's eating her tonight, or you're not leaving that room," Sophia shot back. For extra security, she wedged a steel bar against the doorframe.

What else could she do? Her brother was hopeless when it came to emotions. If she didn't intervene, he'd never make a move.

Now it was just the two of them—Vivian and Liam—trapped together in the suffocating silence.

"You'll have to forgive my sister. Tact was never her strong suit." Liam shoved his hands into his pockets, feigning nonchalance. As if their explosive argument at Blackwood Group had never happened.

Vivian gave a hollow laugh. "I'm the one who should apologize. Julian's insane. I actually thought I could get answers from him. Turns out he's just a pathological liar. Wasted my time. Ruined things between us. God, I'm so stupid." Her voice cracked as she slumped before the vanity, face buried in trembling hands.

Liam's chest tightened at the sight. "You know now, don't you? Go ahead and cry. No need to pretend you're fine. There's no shame in grieving."

The moment Julian appeared, Liam had known the truth about Ethan's death couldn't stay hidden. His outburst at Blackwood Group—his desperate attempts to keep Julian away—had all been to shield Vivian from this pain.

Yet here they were.

"Ha. Know what? You're not making any sense." Vivian's weak denial only made Liam ache more.

He moved closer, resting a hand on her quivering shoulder. "Let it out. He was the love of your life. Of course you'd mourn him." His voice softened. "Just don't drown in it. Adrian and Abigail need their mother. You have to keep living."

"Stop lying to me!" Vivian jerked away, eyes blazing through tears. "Julian deceived me, and so did you! Do you all think I'm that gullible? Ethan Blackwood doesn't die easily. This is some sick joke!"

"I get it—you're not ready." Liam exhaled sharply. "Fine. Let's pretend he's still breathing if that helps. I'll say it as many times as you need: Ethan's alive. Just stop crying."

Since when did Vivian Lockhart crumble like this? The woman who faced every crisis head-on?

If denial was her armor, he'd reinforce it. That had always been the plan.

"His life or death means nothing to me. I won't waste tears on him." Vivian staggered to the bed, back turned as she collapsed onto the mattress. "Even if he died saving me, that's his own damn misfortune." A shaky breath. "I'm exhausted. Leave me alone."

Liam watched her fragile frame tremble under silent sobs. Each shudder felt like a knife twisting in his ribs.

Ethan Blackwood, if you're still breathing somewhere—show yourself. What kind of man lets the woman he loves suffer like this?
###Chapter 472

The suite at The Grand Marquis in Newport City was filled with the cheerful sounds of Pinky Pig playing on the television.

Adrian Lockhart sat cross-legged on the plush couch, his wide eyes fixed on the colorful animation.

Cassandra Delacroix approached with a bowl of freshly washed berries, her lips curved into a practiced smile. "Adrian, have some fruit. They're good for you."

The little boy beamed up at her, his cherubic face lighting up. "Thank you, Aunt Cassandra. You're so pretty and nice. No wonder Mommy likes you."

"You little charmer," Cassandra chuckled, though her fingers tightened slightly around the bowl.

Adrian popped a strawberry into his mouth. "It's true! Everything tastes sweeter when you prepare it. That's why my words are sweet too!"

Laughter bubbled from Cassandra's lips, genuine despite herself.

This child—this impossible, radiant child—was supposed to be nothing more than collateral damage. A necessary sacrifice to secure her place in the Blackwood dynasty. Yet every time those innocent eyes met hers, her resolve wavered.

She'd planned everything meticulously. Contact arranged. Location secured. All she needed was to deliver Adrian to the docks tonight, where a private yacht would take him far from Newport City.

But now, watching him giggle at the cartoon wolf's antics, her stomach twisted.

Cassandra sat beside him, studying his profile as he chewed. The way his cheeks rounded with each bite made her chest ache.

"Adrian," she began carefully, "do you really like Pinky Pig? Don't you think the wolf is... bad?"

The boy shook his head vigorously. "Nuh-uh. The wolf isn't bad. He pretends to be scary, but he never actually catches Pinky. I think maybe he doesn't really want to." His small hand patted Cassandra's knee. "Mommy says nobody's all good or all bad. Even mean people can change if they try."

Cassandra's smile froze.

How ironic that this child would unknowingly echo the very philosophy that had shaped her own mother's rise from mistress to matriarch. The same philosophy that now demanded Adrian's disappearance.

"Your mother is very wise," Cassandra managed. "But sometimes, people don't change. Some wolves... stay wolves."

Adrian tilted his head. "Are you a wolf, Aunt Cassandra?"

The question struck like a physical blow.

"Of course not!" Her voice came out too sharp. She forced another laugh. "I just want you to be careful. The world has real monsters, sweetheart. Never go with strangers. Never trust too easily."

Adrian's knowing gaze held hers a beat too long before he turned back to the screen. "Don't worry. I'm good at telling who's nice." He pointed at the cartoon wolf. "See? He's smiling now. Maybe he just needed a friend."

Cassandra's phone buzzed in her pocket—the final confirmation from the contact at Harbor Market.

Her fingers trembled as she reached for another strawberry.

Tonight. It had to be tonight.
###Chapter 473

Good men were rare these days. Women had to be bold and cunning to claim them and hold onto them.

The harsher you were, the more secure your place in the household. Weakness only led to abandonment—even your children would suffer for it.

Cassandra Delacroix had no other skill but seduction.

She had fought ruthlessly for Sebastian Hunt, wrapping him around her finger with ease.

Sebastian believed she carried his child, but the truth was far darker—the baby didn’t even belong to the Blackwood bloodline.

Even if the child had been healthy, she would never have kept it.

Vivian Lockhart made the perfect scapegoat.

Nathaniel Blackwood was the man Cassandra truly wanted. She would do anything to become his wife.

"Adrian, darling, you must believe I’m a good person. I would never hurt you. You should be grateful your mother has a friend like me." Cassandra smiled sweetly, ruffling Adrian’s hair.

Her mind was made up.

The boy had no one to blame but his own mother.

Suddenly, Adrian turned away from the cartoon he’d been watching. His wide eyes locked onto Cassandra with unsettling intensity.

"W-What’s wrong?" Her pulse spiked under his piercing gaze.

He looked too much like Nathaniel. Those sharp, unblinking eyes—just like his father’s—seemed to see straight through her.

"Nothing. I just think you’re really nice. I like you a lot." His voice was soft, innocent. "I’m so happy I met you. Can I have a hug, Aunty Delacroix?"

Before she could react, his small arms wrapped around her neck in a tight embrace.

Cassandra froze.

He was warm, his tiny frame so fragile against hers. For a fleeting second, something in her chest tightened.

But she didn’t see the disappointment flicker across Adrian’s face.

He had given her a chance. She hadn’t taken it.

Now, she would face the consequences.

"Adrian, it’s late. Drink your milk and go to bed." After a long hesitation, she handed him the glass—laced with enough sleeping pills to knock him out cold.

"Okay. Thank you, Aunty Delacroix." He downed the milk in a few quick gulps.

Within minutes, he was unconscious. No amount of shaking would wake him.

"Don’t hate me, kid. This is your mother’s fault." Cassandra sat on the edge of the bed, staring at his peaceful face. Her expression hardened, though a sliver of regret lingered.

"You’re sweet. I do like you. But you’re Vivian’s son. And I can’t let you stay."

Just then, the doorbell rang.
###Chapter 474

Cassandra rose from her seat and moved toward the entrance. There stood William Carter, her most persistent suitor.

"I've come to collect my reward!" William shoved his way inside, pinning Cassandra against the wall. His lips crashed onto hers with bruising force.

Cassandra remained motionless, arms limp at her sides. Her expression stayed blank, bordering on irritated.

After several unsatisfying kisses, William pulled back with a frustrated growl. "If you despise me so much, why promise yourself as a reward for completing your mission?" His fingers dug into her cheeks. "You're like kissing a corpse. No warmth, no response. Is this supposed to be my reward or my punishment?"

A cold smile twisted Cassandra's lips. "Patience, William. I always keep my promises. Just not today."

"What excuse do you have now?" William's patience wore thin.

"For years I considered you my only love. I never forgot that. When you were still innocent, I wouldn't even let you kiss me. Only after we ended things did I realize what a snake you truly were."

William's grip tightened. "Other men got to touch you so easily, but never me. That's my only regret - the one thing driving me insane. I've dreamed about you. Done things I swore I'd never do. Even hurt an innocent girl. And now you're backing out?"

Cassandra's icy gaze never wavered. "You lost control with that naive friend of hers, Sophia. Didn't expect to actually fall for her, did you? You claim undying love for me, yet develop feelings for someone else in months? Men like you are all the same - full of empty promises!"

"That's not true!" William's anger faltered. His eyes darted nervously. "I was only acting! Using her to get information on Vivian. I even recorded us together to blackmail her into betraying Vivian. Everything I did was for you!"

"Eloquent performance." Cassandra held up her phone. "I recorded everything. Prove your words - send this to Sophia."

"You're insane!" William snatched the device, fingers trembling as he deleted the recording.

Cassandra's laughter rang sharp and mocking. "See? Your love is as fragile as a soap bubble. I've always known - no man can remain faithful. The day men become trustworthy is the day pigs fly!"

After confirming the deletion, William exhaled. "Sophia's kind and innocent. I've hurt her enough. This ends now. I won't be your pawn anymore."

Cassandra smirked. "Think you can walk away that easily? You fell into this abyss the moment you approached Sophia for me. There's no climbing out now."

"You think deleting one recording erases everything?" She tapped her temple. "I uploaded it to the cloud. Along with your little video with Sophia. Imagine her reaction when it goes public. Think she might... take drastic measures?"

William's hands flew to her throat. "Give me the password! Delete everything now!"

Cassandra's smile turned predatory. "I'll consider it... if you do one last thing for me. Succeed, and I'll vanish from your life forever. You and Sophia can live happily - no one ever needs to know your dirty secrets."

William swallowed hard. "You swear?"

"On one condition." Her gaze slid toward the bedroom where Adrian slept peacefully. The unspoken demand hung between them.
###Chapter 475

Nathaniel's expression darkened the moment he saw Adrian sleeping soundly.

"Cassandra, have you lost your mind? How could you do this to a child? He's barely begun his life. Taking him to Crimson Emporium—you've gone too far! Don't you fear retribution?"

Earlier, he had received Cassandra's order—to deliver something "unique" to Harbor Market's Crimson Emporium.

On the surface, Crimson Emporium appeared to be a respectable establishment, housing rare treasures from across the globe. But in truth, it was a den of unspeakable horrors.

The owner, Quentin Blackthorn, was a shadowy figure with unfathomable influence. He had once declared that if a client offered him something truly valuable, he would grant any wish in return.

Some traded priceless heirlooms for love. Others bartered their own flesh for unimaginable wealth.

The rule was simple—if Quentin accepted the offering, the deepest desires of the one who brought it would be fulfilled.

If Cassandra was offering Adrian, she must have struck a deal with Quentin. All she needed now was a trustworthy courier to deliver the boy, and the transaction would be complete.

"Tell me," Nathaniel demanded, his voice tight. "What did you ask for? Money? Power? Immortality?" He couldn't fathom her motives. "You already have everything. This child has his whole life ahead of him. If the Emporium takes him, he'll be destroyed. Stop this madness before it's too late!"

Cassandra laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. She stood beneath the golden glow of the lamp, her posture regal. "You, of all people, preaching morality? After everything you've done? How rich."

Her smile twisted into something bitter. "You found happiness. You walked away unscathed. But me? I have nothing. The man I love is gone. The Blackwoods treat me like a curse. I'll never be a mother. If I don't fight back now, my mother would rise from her grave to scorn me." Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "So tell me—am I really the one going too far?"

For years, she had played the pitiable fool, weaving her way into Ethan's life. She had been so close to becoming a Blackwood.

Then Isabella Lockhart returned.

Like a storm, she shattered everything. No matter what Cassandra did, Isabella was always one step ahead.

Ethan was spellbound. Four years of careful planning—gone in an instant.

Cassandra knew she couldn't defeat Isabella alone. She needed power beyond her own.

And Adrian? He was the perfect offering. Quentin had taken an interest the moment Cassandra mentioned him.

"I have no choice," she hissed. "Kindness is weakness. Mercy is death." Her gaze locked onto Nathaniel's. "We're the same, you and I. If this child isn't delivered on time, neither of us will escape Quentin's wrath. Hesitate now, and you'll lose everything—including Sophia."

That struck home.

Nathaniel had no fear for himself. But Sophia? Quentin was a demon in human skin. If crossed, he would destroy them all without hesitation.

With a heavy breath, Nathaniel moved to the bed and lifted Adrian into his arms. The boy didn't stir.

"Relax," Cassandra said coolly, arms crossed. "He's clever, but he trusts you too much. The milk was laced with enough sedatives to keep him asleep until delivery. Just do your part." Her smile was serpentine. "I know you won't fail."

"You're a monster," Nathaniel spat.

He looked down at Adrian's peaceful face, guilt twisting inside him like a knife.
###Chapter 476

"I could say the same about you!" Cassandra glared at William. Just as she prepared to unleash her sharp tongue,

her gaze landed on Adrian. A sharp pang pierced her chest.

She inhaled deeply, nails digging into her palms. No mercy. Not this time.

"This is the last favor. Delete every video and recording. After today, we're strangers." William's voice was ice as he carried Adrian out of the hotel.

Cassandra stood frozen, watching their retreating figures. Minutes ticked by, her face eerily blank—a porcelain doll with dead eyes.

Then suddenly, she collapsed to her knees. Hysterical laughter erupted from her throat, wild and unhinged. She rolled across the floor, clutching her stomach.

"Pathetic! Even the fool who loved you most walked away. You deserve this emptiness!"

She clawed her way up, spotting Adrian's abandoned sippy cup. The toys she'd bought him lay scattered nearby.

The sting of loss flickered—then vanished. She smothered it.

Nothing left to lose.

"Vivian... your time's up."

William buckled the sleeping boy into the backseat, tucking a fleece blanket around him. Adrian's lashes fluttered against cherub cheeks.

Guilt twisted William's gut.

Mr. Blackthorn's ultimatum echoed: Deliver the child before dawn or the contract burns. Along with you and Cassandra.

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.

The car purred through moonlit streets when his phone buzzed. Sophia's name flashed.

"Sweetheart!" He fumbled to answer. "You're not breaking up with me anymore?"

"Don't get excited." Her tone could frost glass. "But if you prove yourself, I might reconsider."

"Name it. Anything."

"Listen. My friend's desperate—her son's missing. You mentioned your cop friend? Find Adrian. Fast."

Sophia needed this test. Was William truly loyal, or just another snake?

His eyes darted to the rearview mirror. Adrian slept peacefully, oblivious.

William's resolve cracked.
###Chapter 477

"Sophia, if you ever discover I'm not who you think I am—if I turn out to be someone terrible—would you... would you forgive me?" William's voice was unsteady.

"Why ask that now? I already knew you were shady." Sophia crossed her arms. "But it depends on what 'terrible' means. Hurt me, and I'll decide based on how bad it is. Hurt my best friend, though? Unforgivable. Vivian comes first. Always. Cross that line, and we're done. Understand?"

To her and her brother, Vivian wasn't just a friend. She was the one who'd saved them when they had nothing. Their loyalty to her was absolute.

William's face went pale. He stayed silent for a long moment before speaking again.

"Fine. I get it. I know what I have to do."

Sophia frowned. "What's that supposed to mean? Stop being cryptic. Are you helping me or not?"

"I can't." His voice cracked. "If this means we're over, then... so be it." His eyes glistened. "I'm a monster. A fool. I don't deserve to live. But meeting you? Loving you? No regrets. Thank you for saving me. Goodbye, Sophia."

"William, wait—"

The line went dead before she could finish.

Tears streamed down his face.

Sophia's words made it clear—if he returned Adrian to Vivian now, there might still be hope for them. But if he delivered the boy to Crimson Emporium? That would be the end.

He loved her too much to risk her safety. The owner of Crimson Emporium wasn't someone to cross. If they targeted Sophia because of him...

Better to let her go.

"Sorry, kid." William turned to Adrian, guilt heavy in his chest. "I don’t want to do this, but if I don’t, the woman I love gets hurt. I just hope Quentin Blackthorn actually wants you for good reasons."

Despite his crimes, William wasn’t heartless. He’d already planned his redemption—after delivering Adrian, he’d confess everything.

The car pulled into a gas station.

Needing air, William stepped out to smoke.

Just as Cassandra had promised, Adrian remained asleep, drugged by the laced milk.

Or so William thought.

The moment he walked away, Adrian's eyes snapped open.

He’d switched the glasses when Cassandra wasn’t looking. Every word between her and William? He’d heard it all.

This "Quentin Blackthorn" intrigued him. If the man was as powerful as they claimed, maybe he could be convinced to work for Mommy. She could always use more allies.

But Cassandra? She’d pay for hurting Mommy and trying to sell him.

Adrian pulled out his phone and dialed 911.

"Help! I’ve been kidnapped by Cassandra Delacroix. She’s at the Grand Marquis Hotel right now. Arrest her. And send someone to save me—fast. My name is Adrian Lockhart. My mom is Vivian Lockhart. My dad is Nathaniel Blackwood. Oh no—he’s coming back!"

He hung up just as William turned toward the car.
###Chapter 478

Adrian ended the call after delivering the crucial intel. His fingers moved swiftly to disable the phone's location tracking.

The authorities wouldn't trace him easily now.

He'd deliberately left his personal items at the hotel earlier. If Cassandra got apprehended now, the evidence would be damning. A smirk played on his lips.

William finished his cigarette and slid back into the driver's seat. Adrian remained asleep in the back. William exhaled sharply.

"Poor kid."

The gas tank now full, he accelerated toward their destination.

Harbor Market transformed at night into a neon-lit underworld. Dangerous crowds prowled the streets.

Decent folk knew better than to venture here after dark.

Men risked organ harvesting. Women faced worse fates. And fair-skinned boys like Adrian? William shuddered at the possibilities.

His hands trembled on the wheel as they entered the district.

They barely made it half a mile from Crimson Emporium when disaster struck.

BANG!

A tire exploded. A one-eyed thug approached, chewing gum while twirling a machete. "Brave move, coming here at night. Lucky for you, I've got replacements."

William's grip tightened. "No thanks. I've got a spare."

"Your cheap rubber won't last here." The thug's gaze slid past William. His single eye gleamed when he spotted Adrian. "Now that's valuable cargo. I'll take the boy as payment."

"Hands off!" William barked. "He's already spoken for. Name your price."

The thug's machete flashed. "I make the rules here!" The blade smashed against the window. "Out! Now! Or lose your head!"

William slammed the locks. The engine roared as he floored the accelerator.

But the thug whistled. Another vehicle screeched into their path, blocking escape. The machete crashed against the door again. "Last chance, pretty boy!"

William's breath came fast. Harbor Market lived up to its hellish reputation. No wonder Cassandra had sent him.

"Drive, damn it!" Adrian's eyes flew open. No more pretending. He lunged forward, gripping William's seat. "Move!"
###Chapter 479

"Ahh!" Adrian's sudden shout made William jump in his seat, his hands trembling on the steering wheel. "K-kid, you're awake?" he stammered, voice cracking.

Adrian rolled his eyes. "Obviously. I've been awake this whole time. Now focus—floor it and swerve left. Hard. Or we're both dead."

He had planned to keep pretending to sleep, but this guy was hopeless. The enemy was charging straight at them, yet William still hesitated. Adrian clenched his fists, frustration boiling under his skin.

"What? Huh?" William blinked, then snapped his gaze forward. His blood ran cold. Without another thought, he gripped the wheel tighter. "Brace yourself—sharp turn incoming!"

The engine roared as the car lurched violently to the left, tires screeching against the dock pavement. For a split second, it looked like they might make it—until another vehicle slammed into their path, cutting them off from Crimson Emporium.

And then came the sickening pop of a blown tire.

William's stomach dropped. They weren't going anywhere now.

His knuckles whitened around the wheel. He didn’t care about himself, but if Adrian fell into the one-eyed man’s hands…

"Kid, listen," William said urgently. "When I open the door, you jump and run. Get to Crimson Emporium—tell them your name. They’ll protect you."

Crimson Emporium was shrouded in mystery, but its owner, Quentin Blackthorn, had a reputation. Ruthless, yes, but not unhinged. Better Adrian with him than with the monster outside.

Adrian didn’t even flinch. "Worry about yourself. He’s about to smash your window."

Sure enough, the one-eyed man’s blade came crashing through the glass. With a brutal yank, he unlocked the door. "Pathetic. Did you really think you could run from me?"

William fumbled for his phone. "This is kidnapping! I’m calling the police!"

The one-eyed man laughed, then drove his fist into William’s temple. "Police? Laws?" He sneered. "In Harbor Market, strength is the only law. And this kid? He’s mine."

Dazed, William slumped forward. He was a doctor, not a fighter. As the one-eyed man reached for the backseat, he choked out, "Adrian—run!"

But Adrian didn’t move. He crossed his arms, cool as ice. "You sure you want to take me? Doubt you can handle the consequences."

The one-eyed man paused. "Oh? And why’s that?"

"Because Quentin Blackthorn personally requested me." Adrian tilted his head. "Take me to Crimson Emporium. Fight him for me. Winner takes all."

William’s vision swam, but shock cut through the haze. "You—you knew?!"

The one-eyed man scoffed. "Quentin Blackthorn doesn’t just ask for random kids. Why would I pick a fight with him over you?"

Adrian smirked. "Exactly. So back off."
###Chapter 480

The one-eyed thug scoffed at Adrian's words. His patience wore thin as he grabbed the boy by his collar. "Listen here, kid. Start talking or you'll get the same treatment as him!"

William struggled to his feet, blood dripping from his split lip. "L-Let him go!" He lunged forward only to be knocked back by a brutal punch.

Adrian thrashed violently in the man's grip. "Release me now or you'll regret this!" His small fists pounded against the brute's arms.

"Shut your mouth, brat!" The thug raised his hand to strike when a black SUV came screeching around the corner. Metal crunched as it T-boned the thug's vehicle, sending it spinning across the pavement.

"What the hell—" The one-eyed man's curses died in his throat when he recognized the license plate. His knees buckled instantly, forehead pressing against the asphalt in terrified submission.

Adrian wriggled free and approached the massive armored vehicle. Standing on tiptoes, he rapped his knuckles against the tinted window with a frown.

The window lowered with an electric hum.

Dark sunglasses reflected Adrian's determined face as the driver leaned forward. "Are you the owner of Crimson Emporium?"

A cold chuckle answered him. The man's sharp jawline tensed beneath the sunglasses that hid half his face. "Are you Adrian Lockhart?" His voice was deep, measured.

"That's correct. You may call me Adrian." The boy straightened his posture. "Proper etiquette requires you to step out when speaking to someone."

Quentin Blackthorn's eyebrow arched. "And if I refuse?"

"Then we can't be friends." Adrian crossed his arms. "Mother says I shouldn't associate with rude people."

Silence stretched between them before Quentin surprised everyone by opening the door. Towering at six-foot-three in his black trench coat, his presence commanded instant obedience.

The one-eyed thug dared a glance upward before cowering again. "M-Mr. Blackthorn! Forgive me for touching what's yours! Mercy, please!"

Now he believed. Quentin Blackthorn himself had come for this child.

No one in Harbor Market crossed Quentin and lived to tell the tale. The thug knew his fate was sealed.

Ignoring the groveling man, Quentin extended a gloved hand toward Adrian. "Satisfied?"

Adrian studied the offered hand before shaking it firmly. "We'll see."
###Chapter 481

Adrian rubbed his small chin, his tiny forehead creasing in concentration.

He looked absurdly serious for a four-year-old.

After a moment, he stood on his tiptoes and extended a hand toward Quentin Blackthorn. "Since you're sorry," he declared solemnly, "we can be friends now. Nice to meet you. I'll learn a lot from you."

A faint, unconscious smile tugged at Quentin's usually cold lips. Without realizing it, he bent slightly to meet the child's height.

"Nice to meet you too," he rumbled in that deep, intimidating voice. "I'll learn from you as well."

Though tall for his age, Adrian barely reached Quentin's waist. The contrast between the towering, dangerous man and the tiny boy should have been absurd—yet somehow, it worked.

The entire room, including William Carter, gaped. No one could believe Adrian's fearless confidence. Even more shocking was Quentin's reaction—this was a man who inspired terror, not tenderness.

William clutched his bruised ribs, torn. Should he seize this chance to escape? Or beg Quentin to spare the child?

The man seemed reasonable—certainly more so than the one-eyed brute. But before William could speak, Adrian turned to him.

"You did your job," the boy said cheerfully. "Tell Mom I'm fine. I made a new friend, so I won't be home for a while."

"Kid!" William sputtered. "Do you even understand the situation? This isn't safe! We should be asking him to let you go!"

Adrian waved a dismissive hand. "Mom's used to me disappearing. Just tell her I'll come back when I'm done playing. Bye!"

He took a few steps, then paused. "Oh, and stop hanging out with Cassandra Delacroix. She's hopeless. You? There's still time to change. Thanks for the ride!"

With that, Adrian marched back to Quentin and announced, "Okay. You can take me now."

The SUV was massive, but Adrian scrambled up like a determined little monkey.

No one spoke to Quentin like that and lived. Yet Adrian seemed immune to the man's lethal aura—ordering him around without a hint of fear.

Even more baffling? Quentin didn't react with anger. Instead, he carefully buckled Adrian's seatbelt with surprising gentleness.

"Stay put," Quentin warned as Adrian settled into the passenger seat.

The boy lounged back, utterly relaxed. "Don't bother speeding," he said airily. "Mom's way faster. You guys are slow compared to her."
###Chapter 482

The sleek black car pulled up to the notorious Crimson Emporium. Rumors swirled about this place being a trove of wonders—rare artifacts, exotic relics, and curiosities from every corner of the globe.

Yet, the reality was far less imposing. The building itself was unremarkable, blending seamlessly with the surrounding structures. No heavy security, no grand facade—just an ordinary exterior hiding extraordinary secrets.

As the car rolled into the private underground garage, Quentin Blackthorn killed the engine and turned to Adrian. His voice was smooth, almost teasing.

"Last chance to back out. You do know that once you step inside the Crimson Emporium, your fate isn't yours to control anymore, right?"

Adrian blinked up at him, all wide-eyed innocence. "I'm just a kid. Nothing I say counts." He grinned. "And if you want control over my fate, you'll have to ask my mom first."

Quentin chuckled. The boy was sharp—far sharper than most adults.

"Your mom again, huh?" His fingers tapped rhythmically against the steering wheel. The delicate feather mask he wore couldn't hide the smirk tugging at his lips. "You've been singing her praises the entire ride. Is she really that incredible?"

"Of course!" Adrian's voice was fierce with pride. "Mom’s the best in the world. There’s nothing she can’t do. No one compares to her. I love her more than anything."

Then, his expression dimmed. His small hands clenched into fists. "But right now... she's fighting someone dangerous. I have to help her. I won’t let her carry this alone."

Quentin arched a brow.

Adrian met his gaze unflinchingly. "You’re probably wondering who this enemy is, right? Well, it’s not hard to guess. Mom says he’s the most ruthless, arrogant man in Newport City. Everyone wants him gone—including you, I bet. That’s why I came to you. Help her win, and she’ll reward you generously."

The air between them grew heavy. Quentin’s fingers stilled. His smile turned icy.

"Who is this villain, then?"

Adrian sighed dramatically, as if the answer were obvious. "Ethan Blackwood, of course! The CEO of Blackwood Group? Seriously, how do you not know?" He shook his head in disappointment. "I thought you were supposed to be smart."

Quentin’s grip on the wheel tightened. His voice dropped to a dangerous murmur. "And what does your mother think of him?"

"Mom says he’s the most cunning, heartless man she’s ever met. The one person she regrets ever knowing. He’s made so many enemies—half the city wants him dead!"

"Is that so?" Quentin’s jaw clenched. His mask hid his expression, but his voice was razor-sharp.

Then, abruptly, he leaned closer. His gaze locked onto Adrian’s face—the bright eyes, the stubborn set of his jaw.

"Tell me, kid," he murmured. "Did your mother ever tell you who your real father is?"
###Chapter 483

"So... about that—"

Adrian's gaze flickered nervously as he considered the question. He couldn't risk revealing his true identity—that he was the son of Nathaniel Blackwood himself. That would ruin any chance of this man agreeing to help his mother.

Steeling himself, he adopted a serious tone. "My father is Liam Osborne. You know him, right? Mommy says he's not bad at all. He's the heir to the Osborne family, one of the Elite Eight in Newport City. And with the Lockhart and Osborne families combined, taking down the Blackwoods will be easy!"

"Is that so?" Mr. Q's voice was sharp, laced with irritation. "Your mother has quite the ambition."

Vivian Lockhart, you deceitful woman. Did you really think you could fool me?

But it didn't matter. Whether this boy carried Blackwood blood or not, as long as he was Vivian's son, the deal was worth it.

Expressionless, Mr. Q pushed open the car door and stepped out, his long strides carrying him into the pawnshop.

Adrian, fearless as ever, trailed behind with cheerful little hops, as if this were just another ordinary day. The boy had nerves of steel.

Inside, a handsome young man in a pristine white coat greeted them warmly. "Welcome back, Mr. Q. So... this is the 'priceless treasure' you mentioned?"

The man was Carter Whitmore, manager of the Crimson Emporium. Though young, his sharp, discerning eyes had earned him a reputation as the top appraiser in the business. Nothing entered the shop without his approval.

His gaze swept over Adrian, assessing. "He's adorable, sure, but clearly raised like royalty. He won't be much use for labor, nor is he worth much in resale. What's the point of bringing him here?"

Days ago, Carter had been buzzing with excitement over Mr. Q's promised "rare find." But this? Just some pampered brat?

"That's none of your concern," Mr. Q replied coolly. "Just make sure he's comfortable for the next few days."

He shoved his hands into his pockets, deliberately keeping his distance—until Adrian suddenly darted forward and latched onto his leg like a koala.

"I knew you were a good person, Mr. Q!" the boy chirped, his voice sweet and innocent.

Mr. Q froze, torn between pushing him away and... something else.

Adrian tilted his round, cherubic face up, beaming like sunshine. Then, in a startlingly mature tone, he declared, "Congratulations. You passed my test. I can introduce you to Mommy now. Work hard as her assistant, and your future will be bright!"

Both men stared, speechless.

Carter finally understood why his boss wanted this kid. His sheer audacity was rare even among adults. With the right polishing, his potential was limitless.

He braced for Mr. Q's fury—rumors said the man despised physical contact.

Instead, Mr. Q merely ruffled Adrian's hair and muttered, "Don't push your luck."

Wait... is this brat actually his secret son?!

The next morning, Sophia Osborne eased open Vivian's bedroom door, peeking inside.

The room was immaculate, showing no signs of the "passionate night" she'd anticipated.

Her best friend Vivian lay curled under a thick beige blanket, fast asleep, her back turned to the door.
###Chapter 484

The morning light spilled through the curtains, revealing Vivian still curled up in bed. Across the room, her hopeless brother Nathaniel lounged on the sofa, fast asleep. His crisp shirt remained perfectly tucked, not a single wrinkle in sight. Even his dark hair lay undisturbed, every strand in place.

Vivian sighed. A decade of unresolved tension between these two, and they were still trapped in this endless dance of unspoken feelings. It was enough to drive her mad.

"Ahem!" Sophia barged in, yanking the curtains open with dramatic flair. Sunlight flooded the room. "Rise and shine, you two! The day's wasting!"

Nathaniel jolted awake, his expression darkening. In one swift motion, he seized Sophia by the collar, hauling her backward.

"You little brat," he growled. "Finally decided to show your face, huh? Locking us in here was a bold move. Too bold."

Sophia shrieked, flailing like a trapped bird. "Let go, you idiot! I was helping you! All my efforts—wasted!"

She twisted toward Vivian, desperation in her voice. "Vivian, save me! He's lost his mind!"

Despite the chaos, Vivian remained motionless, her back turned to them. Unnervingly still.

Sophia frowned, pausing mid-struggle. "Something's wrong with her." She shot Nathaniel an accusing look. "You were supposed to comfort her last night. What happened?"

Nathaniel shoved his hands into his pockets, his gaze lingering on Vivian's rigid form. "She's in self-preservation mode."

"Self-preservation?" Sophia echoed.

"When the mind takes a hit too hard," Nathaniel murmured, "it shuts down. Some people cry. Some rage. Some drown themselves in vices." His voice softened. "She chose sleep."

Sophia scoffed. "Vivian? Traumatized? She'd never doubt Adrian's survival. This isn't about him."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. The truth weighed heavy. "Ethan Blackwood is dead. He died saving her. The doctors couldn't revive him."

Sophia's face drained of color. "What?" Her voice cracked. "Ethan Blackwood—dead? That's impossible. The man was a force of nature. Newport City's untouchable king doesn't just—"

"I saw his body," Nathaniel cut in flatly. "White sheet. Cold steel gurney."

A bitter taste filled his mouth. Ethan had been his rival in every way—business, love, life. He'd spent years chasing the man's shadow, only for death to steal that chance forever. Now, Ethan would remain an unconquered legend.

The room plunged into suffocating silence.

Then—Vivian's phone buzzed on the nightstand.
###Chapter 485

Nathaniel and Sophia exchanged glances. They assumed Vivian was still fast asleep and reached for her phone.

Before their fingers could brush the device, Vivian sat up silently and answered the call with eerie composure.

"Hello, Officer. Yes, this is Vivian Lockhart. Adrian Lockhart is my son. Do you have news about him?"

The conversation stretched for several tense moments before she finally nodded. "Understood. I'll be there immediately."

Vivian's expression remained unreadable—no panic, no relief. Just calm detachment. Meanwhile, Nathaniel and Sophia vibrated with barely contained energy.

"Was that the police?" Sophia blurted, eyes bright. "Did they find Adrian?"

"They've apprehended the kidnapper," Vivian said evenly, sliding out of bed. "Details will have to wait until we get there."

She stretched lazily, as if discussing weekend plans, then strolled to her walk-in closet to select an outfit.

Her nonchalance unnerved them. Nathaniel studied her with a frown. "You're... handling this remarkably well, Boss."

Vivian's fingers paused mid-air over a silk blouse. A beat passed before she turned with a wry smile.

"Contrary to popular belief, I'm not made of glass. I wasn't hiding under the covers to mourn. I was exhausted. Now that I've slept, I'm ready."

Sophia wasn't convinced. She crossed the room and gripped Vivian's shoulders, voice thick. "Nathaniel Blackwood was a bastard, but he was your first love. You watched him die saving you. Don't tell me you feel nothing."

Vivian exhaled slowly. "Sad? Yes. Devastated? No. Mostly... adrift." She met Sophia's gaze squarely. "But dead or alive, Nathaniel changes nothing. The Lockharts will still surpass the Blackwoods among Newport City's Elite Eight."

Sophia opened her mouth, but Nathaniel silenced her with a look. Some realizations had to come from within.

The police station hummed with fluorescent-lit urgency. After paperwork, Vivian was ushered into interrogation alone while Nathaniel and Sophia waited outside.

The detective—a weary-eyed man in his thirties—gestured to a chair. "Ms. Lockhart. Last night, we received a call from Adrian. He reported being trafficked, provided the perpetrator's name, address, and evidence." He leaned forward. "Is your son actually missing?"

Vivian didn't blink. "Yes. My entire circle has been searching. Given his history of... wanderings, we delayed filing a report."
###Chapter 486

The officer taking notes glanced up at Vivian, disapproval etched across his face.

"You let your son stay missing this long without reporting it?" His tone was sharp. "What kind of parent does that? Thank heavens the boy had the sense to call us himself! We haven't located him yet, but we've detained the kidnapper. At least it's not a total disaster."

Vivian dipped her head in agreement. "You're absolutely right, Officer. We failed him as parents."

Internally, she sighed. I wonder which poor souls crossed paths with Adrian this time. They should be grateful if he didn't sell THEM into trafficking instead.

Adrian had a habit of vanishing—and every time, some fool tried to take advantage. Without fail, those kidnappers ended up begging the police for protection from the real menace: Adrian Lockhart.

"The suspect confessed," the officer continued, "but refuses to disclose the child's location. Claims she targeted him because of a personal vendetta against you. She's demanding a private conversation."

"Vendetta?" Vivian's fingers tightened.

She'd made enemies—the dangerous kind. If one of them had Adrian... Her stomach twisted.

"Where is she?" Vivian's voice turned icy. "Bring her in."

The officer nodded, speaking into his intercom. Moments later, the door swung open.

Cassandra Delacroix shuffled in, cuffs gleaming. Her dead-eyed stare snapped to life at the sight of Vivian. A vicious smile curled her lips.

"Couldn't wait to hear the news, could you, Vivian? Should've stayed home. Soon enough, you'd have received... a special delivery."

Vivian's nails bit into her palms. "If you wanted revenge, you should've come for ME. Not a child. Do you believe in karma, Cassandra?"

"Spare me the lecture!" Cassandra lunged against her restraints, voice shrill. "You murdered my baby! Took motherhood from me forever! Now I'll return the favor—that precious boy of yours? He's suffering horrors you can't imagine!"

The officers wrestled her back as she shrieked, "God gave you such a perfect son... Pity he shares your cursed blood! I made sure he'll beg for death before I'm done!"

Vivian's blood ran cold.

"Any moment now," Cassandra hissed, "you'll learn his fate. And you'll drown in guilt knowing YOU caused it!"

"Enough!" An officer slammed Cassandra onto the table. "One more word and you're in solitary!"

Cassandra laughed, cheek mashed against steel. "Do your worst! That boy is already broken! Vivian Lockhart, you'll—"

Vivian stood abruptly. "Officer, I need the room."

Her voice was calm. Deadly calm.

The Carmine Emporium wasn't just any black-market den—it was a point of no return. Its owner, Quentin Blackthorn, was Nathaniel Blackwood's most ruthless enemy. And Adrian, as Nathaniel's son...

Cassandra had struck where it hurt most.

Because nothing destroyed a mother faster than her child's suffering.

Vivian's hands trembled—but her voice didn't. "Leave us."
###Chapter 487

The officers exchanged glances before nodding at Vivian's request. They filed out of the interrogation room, leaving only Vivian and Cassandra inside.

Every word, every movement was still being monitored.

Cassandra remained haughty despite the handcuffs. A sinister chuckle escaped her lips. "Did you really think sending them away would make me talk?"

Her laughter turned icy. "I targeted your son to hurt you. Seeing you suffer brings me joy. Why would I stop now?"

"Suffer?" Vivian leaned back casually, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "What gave you that idea? My son is brilliant. He'll find his way back before you know it."

Her eyes hardened. "But you? Once I press charges, you'll rot in prison for life. Pitiful, really."

Cassandra's smirk faltered for a split second before she scoffed. "Clever, yes. But no match for the man who has him now. Wake up, Vivian. Face reality."

Vivian's knuckles whitened as Cassandra leaned in, whispering, "Go home. Order a tiny coffin instead. Give him a proper send-off."

"Shut your mouth!"

Vivian snapped. In one swift motion, she lunged, fingers closing around Cassandra's throat. Her eyes burned with lethal intent.

"Death wish? I'll grant it."

Cassandra gasped, face flushing, yet she choked out a laugh. "Do it! Ruin your life too! Nathaniel will never forgive you. I'll live forever in his heart!"

Vivian's grip loosened slightly at the name.

"Nathaniel Blackwood?" Her voice dripped with disdain. "He's dead. Bringing him up now is pathetic."

Cassandra staggered as if struck. "Liar!"

Vivian released her, coldly observing her shock. "Your protector is gone. No one’s saving you now." She tilted her head. "Tell me where Adrian is, and I might drop the charges."

"Never!" Cassandra screamed, tears streaming. "Nathaniel was untouchable! This is a trick!"

Vivian shrugged. "Believe what you want." She turned toward the door. "You threw away your chance. Don’t cry about it later."

The officers outside tensed as Vivian emerged.

"Any leads?" one asked.

Vivian offered a faint, unreadable smile. "Just a misunderstanding. Release Ms. Delacroix immediately."

They gaped. "But she kidnapped your son!"

Vivian arched a brow. "Adrian played a prank. He called the police because he knew we didn’t get along." She sighed. "I’ve found him. To apologize for the trouble, I’ll donate $150,000 to this precinct."

The officers exchanged bewildered looks.

"But—"

Vivian was already walking away.
###Chapter 488

"I appreciate your efforts. I'll take my leave now."

Vivian gave a slight nod to the officers before turning on her heel and walking away.

In the waiting area, Liam and Sophia had been pacing nervously. The moment they spotted Vivian emerging, they rushed forward.

"Finally! What happened? Any news about Adrian?" Sophia demanded, her fingers twisting anxiously.

Vivian's expression remained unreadable. "Keep an eye out for Cassandra Delacroix. When she exits, detain her immediately. She knows where Adrian is."

"Cassandra?" Sophia's face darkened instantly. "That venomous witch! Don't tell me she's behind this?"

Vivian didn't confirm or deny. Instead, she locked eyes with Liam. "I'm counting on you. The Osbornes have... particular expertise in these matters."

The Osborne family's roots ran deep in the underworld. Their reputation was built on walking the razor's edge, collecting interrogation methods like trophies along the way. If anyone could make Cassandra talk, it was them.

Vivian had initially planned to let Cassandra go after obtaining Adrian's location. But gentle persuasion clearly wouldn't work on her. Sometimes cruelty was the only language certain people understood.

That's precisely why she'd arranged for Cassandra's release—to make their upcoming "conversation" more... private.

"Leave it to me." Liam's icy gaze glinted dangerously. "She'll be singing like a canary within the hour."

Previously, Nathaniel's protection had shielded Cassandra, forcing Liam to hold back. But with her guardian gone? The gloves were off.

Meanwhile, Cassandra nearly wept with relief upon hearing of her impending release.

"Mr. Blackwood must have intervened! I knew Nathaniel wouldn't abandon me!" She dabbed at her tears dramatically.

"Just get out already," the officer snapped, shoving her toward the exit.

Free at last, Cassandra immediately reached for her phone to call Nathaniel.

No answer.

Her elation curdled into unease. "This doesn't make sense. Unless..."

A chill ran down her spine. Something wasn't right. The police station suddenly felt safer than the outside world.

Just as hesitation gripped her, a familiar voice spoke from behind.

"Ms. Delacroix?"

Cassandra spun around, her breath catching.

"J-Julian Blackwood?"

Nathaniel's cousin stood there, hands casually tucked in his pockets, smiling like a shark scenting blood.

"You look well," he remarked smoothly. "Nathaniel asked me to escort you home."
###Chapter 489

Liam Osborne paced outside the police station for what felt like hours. Still no sign of Briar Desrosiers. His patience snapped like a twig.

He stormed inside, demanding answers from the officer handling Briar's case. The truth hit him like a slap - she'd been released hours ago.

"Damn it!" Liam's fist connected with the wall as he dialed Vivian Lockhart.

"Boss, I screwed up. That snake must've known we were waiting. She slipped out another exit."

"Forget it." Vivian's voice crackled through the phone. "I'll handle this my way."

Back at Sunup Residence, Vivian's fingers flew across the keyboard. The glow of the monitor cast sharp shadows on her determined face. She'd hacked into the Lux Hotel's surveillance system.

The footage made her blood boil. There was Briar, doting on Adrian like he was her own. Shopping sprees. Ice cream. Even bedtime stories.

But the worst part? Adrian holding Briar's hand willingly. Smiling. Like some happy little family.

"My God..." Vivian pressed her palms against her temples. "I might actually stroke out."

Sophia Osborne stifled a laugh beside her. "Who knew our little tough guy could be so easily bought with toys and candy?"

Then Sophia's smile died. Her nails dug into her palms.

There he was. William Carter. Knocking on Briar's hotel room door.

Vivian slammed the laptop shut. "Enough. If Adrian's smart enough to turn Briar in himself, he can find his way home."

"Did you see that?" Sophia's voice trembled.

"See what?" Vivian's terrible acting could've won a Razzie.

"Play it again." Sophia's fingers trembled as she reached for the laptop.

"Can't. Access expired."

Sophia grabbed Vivian's arm. "Hack it again! I need to know if I'm going crazy!"

Vivian sighed. "You're not crazy. William and Briar have history. Serious history."

Sophia's face crumpled. She slapped her own cheeks hard. "I'm such an idiot! All those questions about you... I was just his pawn!"

Her fists pounded her thighs. "This is all my fault! Adrian's gone because of me! Hit me, Vivian! I deserve it!"
###Chapter 490

Sophia's hands trembled violently as guilt consumed her entire being. Hot tears streamed down her cheeks without restraint.

She grabbed Vivian's hands and pressed them against her own chest, as if physical pain could somehow atone for her betrayal.

"Stop talking nonsense! How could I ever blame you?" Vivian gently wiped Sophia's tears away with maternal patience. "The real villain here is that snake William Carter."

Her voice softened as she continued, "Consider this a painful lesson. Never trust men blindly again. Always think before you act, otherwise you'll keep getting played like a fool!"

Sophia nodded furiously, her small hands balling into determined fists. "I swear I'll never forget! Men only bring misery - one lifetime isn't enough for their betrayal! After I deal with that bastard William, I'm joining a convent!"

Vivian couldn't help but chuckle at her friend's dramatic declaration.

"Hold off on killing him just yet," Vivian advised. "With Cassandra Delacroix missing, William's our only lead to find Adrian. He was working for her, remember?"

Time was slipping away. Every moment delayed meant her son might forget his real mother and bond with that imposter instead.

As if summoned by their conversation, Sophia's phone rang - William's name flashing on the screen.

"Well, well," Sophia spat into the phone, her voice dripping with venom. "How brave of you to call after what you've done, Dr. Carter!"

"Seems you've discovered everything," William's resigned voice came through. "Meet me? I'll explain everything."

"At least you've got some decency left!" Sophia snapped before hanging up.

She immediately began tearing through the apartment in a frenzy.

"What are you searching for?" Vivian asked.

"My gun. Liam gave it to me for protection." Sophia's voice shook with barely contained rage. "Never thought I'd actually need to use it!"

She finally retrieved the compact pistol from the study shelf. Running her fingers along the cold metal, she hissed, "Once he leads us to Adrian, I'm putting a bullet between his eyes. Nobody betrays an Osborne woman and lives!"

Vivian watched her best friend's theatrics with quiet amusement. She knew Sophia better than anyone - that gentle heart could never truly harm another soul. They were alike in that way.

Even when wronged, they couldn't summon true hatred. Vivian's thoughts drifted unwillingly to Nathaniel - his death had left not satisfaction, but a hollow ache where pain once lived.

She forcefully shook away the memory. Thinking of him always reopened wounds that never fully healed.

William had chosen their first date spot - an upscale beachfront restaurant. He sat alone, drowning his sorrows in glass after glass of whiskey as waves crashed rhythmically against the shore.

The roar of Sophia's sports car announced her arrival before she stormed inside, zeroing in on William instantly.

"William Carter, you lying piece of shit!" she screamed, drawing stares from other diners.

She lunged at him, slapping him hard across both cheeks before yanking his hair painfully. "Where's my nephew? Tell me now!"
###Chapter 491

The brutal beating quickly drew a crowd of spectators.

Vivian found a secluded spot and sat down gracefully, crossing her legs. She was ready to intervene if Nathaniel dared to fight back—she’d make sure he learned his lesson.

But Nathaniel’s reaction stunned her.

Sophia struck him four, five times—hard—yet he didn’t even flinch. His expression remained devoted, almost reverent.

"Sophia," he murmured, cheeks reddened from the blows, "can I hold you?"

His arms stretched toward her as if the pain meant nothing. All he wanted was to pull her close.

"Don’t you dare touch me, you bastard!"

Her fury only grew. She slapped him again and again until her palms burned.

The crowd couldn’t stay silent.

"This woman is insane! Who does she think she is? No man deserves this kind of abuse!"

"Pathetic. Look at him still begging for her attention. He’s asking for it at this point."

"Since when is it okay for women to hit men? Where’s the justice?"

Sophia’s temper flared. She whirled on them, snarling, "Got nothing better to do? Shut your mouths and leave, or I’ll slap you too!"

But the taunts only grew louder.

"A man like him—refined, handsome—deserves better than some violent shrew."

Then, a bold young woman stepped forward, gripping Nathaniel’s arm. "Sweetheart," she cooed, "if she treats you like this, she doesn’t love you. Dump her. I’ll treat you right."

Sophia saw red. She yanked Nathaniel behind her, staking her claim. "This bastard is mine. Even if I beat him to death, he stays mine. Back off, you little nobody!"

The woman smirked. "Let him decide. No man would stay with a brute like you."

She leaned around Sophia, whispering to Nathaniel, "Blink if you need help. We’ll get you out of this."

His face was swollen, his perfect features marred—yet he smiled.

"Everyone, relax," he said, voice calm. "This is just how we show love. The harder she hits me, the more she cares. And I love her for it. You wouldn’t understand."

The crowd gaped.

Sophia wanted to scream. "You’re insane!"

The woman backed off, embarrassed. "Fine. Your funeral."

With nothing left to gawk at, the crowd dispersed.

Nathaniel turned to Sophia, eyes shining. "Now that they’re gone… hit me as much as you want."

He took her hand, closed his eyes, and waited.

To him, this was bliss. She was touching him. Fighting for him.

"I’d die happy if it’s by your hand," he whispered.

Sophia gagged.
###Chapter 492

Her loathing had twisted into something far worse—pure revulsion.

"Want to die? I'll gladly help you with that."

Her eyes burned with feral rage. Every fiber of her being screamed to pull the trigger, to make him pay for the lies, the deception. But—damn it—she couldn't.

"Enough! Give Adrian back to us. After this, we're done. Forever."

Nathaniel shook his head, his voice ragged. "Even if you kill me, I won't tell you where he is. The people who have him? They're dangerous. You can't handle them. If I talk, you'll be next. I'm already at the end of my rope... I have no choice."

"Nathaniel Blackwood!"

Sophia's fury erupted. She drove her knee into his stomach. "Do you have any idea what Adrian means to Vivian and me? If you have even a shred of remorse, you'll tell me now. Don't make me end you."

He doubled over, pain contorting his features.

Those once-bright eyes, always so full of warmth, now swam with tears. Grief.

His arms lifted weakly, a plea in his whisper. "Sophia... just hold me. Please."

She froze.

Beating him wasn't working. Threats were useless. Fine. She'd play his game.

Her voice softened, calculated. "If I do... will you tell me the truth?"

A slow nod. "Yes. Everything. Just... let me feel you one last time."

"Fine."

She stepped into his embrace, her skin crawling.

Disgust coiled in her gut. This liar, this traitor—daring to act like he still had the right to touch her.

If not for Adrian, she'd have put a bullet between his eyes already.

"Sophia... I never thought I'd fall for someone like you."

His arms tightened, desperate, as if he could fuse them together.

"Remember our first meeting? Right here, in this restaurant. You were beating the hell out of some creep harassing a waitress. Sent him flying with one kick. Told him you were Sophia Osborne—Harborview City's fiercest woman."

A humorless laugh rattled in his chest.

"I thought you were insane. Not my type at all. Who'd want a woman that violent? But... a month with you, and I was gone. Completely."

Her jaw clenched. She forced herself to stay still.

"You're reckless, loyal to a fault. So damn pure it made me hate myself every time I touched you."

Sophia rolled her eyes. She wanted to shove him away, scream, demand answers. But she bit her tongue.

Play the role. Find Adrian.

"I let Cassandra manipulate me. That obsession... it ruined everything. I hurt you. Hurt Vivian. I don't deserve forgiveness."

"Damn right you don't." Her fingers twitched toward her gun. "Now make it right. Stop stalling and—"

A wet, hacking cough cut her off.

She recoiled.

Blood. Dark and thick, trickled from his lips.

He smiled—broken, resigned.

"Sophia... I lied to you. But my love wasn't one of them. I know you can't do it... so I'll do it for you."
###Chapter 493

Nathaniel was barely holding on. His legs gave out, forcing him to lean heavily against Sophia's shoulder.

He'd known for a long time that his sins were unforgivable. There was no path back to her.

Death was his only escape. But before that, he needed to see her one last time. To hold her.

The poison he'd taken before this meeting was already working its way through his veins.

"Sophia... this is what I deserve." His voice was weak, broken. "I regret so much... but never you. Never knowing you."

He gasped, struggling to keep his arms around her. "At least... I get to die in your arms."

Sophia's eyes burned with unshed tears. "Nathaniel Carter," she hissed, gripping his shirt. "You're still playing games. What kind of trick is this? A pity act?"

She shook him. "Tell me where Adrian is. Now. Three... two—"

From her seat across the room, Vivian watched the scene unfold. Too far to hear their words, but close enough to see the raw emotion.

Sophia had beaten him. Then embraced him. Now he was sobbing like a broken man.

It was messy. Complicated.

Vivian didn't interfere.

Nathaniel had been a bastard, but if he'd truly changed—if he loved Sophia—she'd let them have this.

Love made fools of everyone.

Even when you knew better.

Even when it was toxic.

Vivian took a slow sip of her drink, forcing her thoughts away from Ethan.

Then a waiter appeared, placing a crystal glass in front of her. A shimmering blue cocktail.

"From the gentleman over there, miss. A Midnight Tides."

She barely glanced at it. "Leave it."

Men had been buying her drinks all night. She wasn't interested.

The waiter hesitated. "He insisted you'd like it. Said it was your favorite."

Vivian froze.

Her fingers closed around the glass. One sip—and her entire body went rigid.

That flavor. That exact blend of vodka, mint, and lime.

Only one person had ever known this recipe.

She stood so fast her chair nearly toppled. "Where is he?"

The waiter blinked. "He left."

"Description. Now."

"Tall. Handsome. Cold expression—"

Vivian didn't wait for the rest. "Which way did he go?"

Her pulse roared in her ears.

Because that drink?

She'd created it for one person.

Ethan.

And if he was here—

If he was alive—

She was going to find him.
###Chapter 494

She was certain he wasn't dead. That man had more lives than a cockroach. There was no way death could claim him so easily.

Vivian discovered from the waiter that Ethan had exited through the side door. Without hesitation, she turned to follow him—

"Help! Someone's collapsed!"

A shrill scream pierced the air as a woman pointed at William's motionless body on the floor.

Panic erupted. Most patrons fled, but a few curious onlookers formed a tight circle around the scene.

"William, you bastard! Quit faking!" Sophia's hands trembled violently as she shook his limp form. "Get up right now or I swear—"

Something felt off. Vivian abandoned her pursuit and pushed through the crowd.

"What happened?" Her sharp tone cut through the chaos.

"That woman killed him!" An accusatory finger jabbed toward Sophia. "She was slapping him earlier, and now look!"

"Call the police! Don't let the murderer escape!"

Sophia's face drained of color. "That's impossible! This spineless worm wouldn't die from a few slaps!" She kicked William's shoe. "Enough games!"

The crowd's murmurs grew hostile.

Vivian's patience snapped. "Silence!" Her command froze everyone in place.

"Viv, check what trick this scumbag's pulling." Sophia stepped back, feigning indifference. "He can't die yet—not before telling me where Adrian is."

Vivian knelt, examining the dark blood at William's lips. She inhaled sharply. "Poison. A lethal dose, by the looks of it."

Sophia staggered as if struck. Her vision blurred with unshed tears.

Guilt? Cowardice? Was this his pathetic way out?

"Don't break down yet." Vivian's voice was steady. "If we get him to a hospital now, they might pump his stomach in time."

"Let him rot." But Sophia was already hauling him up, her movements frantic.

Bystanders rushed to assist.

Vivian didn't follow. Sophia could handle this.

She had a far more pressing matter—finding Ethan before the night ended.

The side door beckoned.
###Chapter 495

The side door opened onto the beach, where the ocean breeze danced across the water's surface, sending gentle waves lapping against the shore.

Night had fallen, casting the beach in a dim, silvery glow. Only a handful of couples strolled along the sand, their laughter carried away by the wind.

Vivian stepped onto the uneven terrain, her sharp gaze sweeping the coastline with urgency.

The wind tangled her hair and lifted the hem of her white dress, exposing her toned legs. She moved like a shadow slipping through the darkness—graceful yet untamed.

She searched for what felt like an eternity, but her efforts yielded nothing. The initial thrill of the chase faded into frustration.

"Ethan, damn you," she muttered under her breath. "Are we playing hide-and-seek now? How childish."

The absurdity of it all struck her. If he was alive, he would show himself eventually.

With a sigh, she bent to brush the sand from her calves, then tucked her windblown hair behind her ears. It was time to go home.

But as she straightened, her breath caught.

A tall, familiar figure stood about a hundred yards ahead, his back to her as he stared out at the ocean. The lighting was poor, but the silhouette was unmistakable—broad shoulders, that proud posture, the sharp angle of his jaw.

It had to be Ethan.

Her pulse spiked.

"Ethan!"

The name tore from her lips before she could stop herself.

But instead of turning, the man bolted.

Vivian froze for half a second before instinct kicked in. She sprinted after him.

"Stop running!"

Her legs, still recovering from injury, protested, but she pushed through the pain. She couldn’t let him disappear again.

The soft sand made every step treacherous.

Ahead, the man stumbled, crashing onto the beach with a muffled curse.

Vivian didn’t hesitate. She lunged, pinning him beneath her with the precision of a predator.

"Got you," she hissed. "No more games. What are you hiding from?"

The man beneath her went still, then let out a low, amused chuckle.

"Still relentless, I see," he said, his voice laced with amusement. "If this were Ethan, I doubt he'd survive your ambush."

Vivian's stomach dropped.

Julian turned his head, revealing a face eerily similar to Ethan's—but not quite the same.

"Sorry," he said, flashing an apologetic grin. "I just wanted to buy you a drink. Didn’t mean to give you the wrong idea."

Their position was uncomfortably intimate, her legs straddling his waist.

Vivian recoiled, scrambling off him with a scowl.

Julian sat up, brushing sand from his clothes. "Though I can’t say I mind the view."

She glared. "Not funny."

His smirk faded. "No. It’s not."

For a moment, neither spoke. The ocean roared between them.

Then Julian sighed. "You really thought I was him, didn’t you?"

Vivian didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.
###Chapter 496

Vivian's face twisted in irritation as she quickly pushed Julian away. She straightened her clothes with sharp, angry movements.

"Are you telling me you were the one who made that Midnight Tides earlier?" Her voice was ice.

Julian remained sprawled on the sand, arms propped behind him. He tilted his head up at her, unfazed. "What? Did you think Ethan made it for you?"

Vivian scoffed, turning her gaze toward the dark, churning sea. Her lips pressed into a thin line.

Julian shrugged. "Ethan made it for me once. Took me forever to get the recipe out of him. Said it was your creation." A faint smirk played on his lips. "Interesting drink. Vodka's fire and mint's chill—complete opposites, yet they create something... magical together. Kind of like you and Ethan."

Vivian rolled her eyes. "You're reading too much into it. I mixed it on a whim. Didn't even remember the recipe until you brought it up."

"Still lying to yourself?" Julian arched a brow. "If you really forgot, why did you chase after me like a madwoman?"

"So you were just messing with me?"

Vivian's glare could have burned through steel. "You think it's funny, playing me for a fool? Should've known. Every man in the Blackwood family is twisted. Ethan's an iceberg, Julian's a lunatic, and you—you're just a brat."

The memory of her sprinting after him, shouting like some lovesick idiot, made her cringe.

She wasn’t just angry at Julian. She was furious at herself—for losing control over a man whose profile, for one fleeting second, had reminded her of Ethan.

Julian didn’t argue. He patted the sand beside him. "Four years is a long time. We’ve got catching up to do."

Vivian turned away. "I have nothing to say to you. It’s late. I’m leaving."

She wanted nothing to do with Julian—or any Blackwood.

"What if it’s about Ethan?"

Her steps faltered.

Julian’s voice was low, deliberate. "Don’t you want to know how he is?"

Vivian’s fingers curled into fists. Slowly, she turned back and sat beside him.

"Talk."

The sea breeze sharpened her senses. She needed answers. She’d never believed Ethan was dead.

Julian stared at the restless waves, his expression unreadable. "I don’t know if he’s alive." He glanced at her. "If I said that, would you hit me?"

Vivian’s jaw clenched. "Yes."

"Hold off." He exhaled. "I’ll tell you what I know. Maybe it’ll help."

He began. "Blackwood Group’s grown fast these past four years. Too fast. There’s rot underneath—power struggles, backstabbing. If something happened to Ethan, it wasn’t an accident. It was planned. Just like Sebastian’s death."

Vivian went still. "You’re saying—both of them were murdered?"

Julian nodded. "Same people. And we need your help."
###Chapter 497

"Me?"

Vivian Lockhart frowned, completely baffled by Julian Carter's suggestion.

She was a stranger to Ethan Blackwood and had no ties to the Blackwood family. Why would Julian come to her for help? He must have mistaken her for someone far more charitable than she was.

Julian's expression darkened. "Six months ago, I resigned as Chief R&D Officer at QuantumTech and sold a portion of my shares. The company has new ownership now. The incoming chairman has a technical background, but he’s ruthless in business. He plans to overhaul the entire company—staff, management, partnerships. My influence is gone."

Vivian arched a brow. "Businesses change hands. Even the strongest empires fall. What’s your point?"

"I’m not cut out for corporate warfare. I don’t care what happens to QuantumTech. But Blackwood Group and QuantumTech have always worked seamlessly because of my relationship with Ethan. Their partnership is vital."

"Now that Ethan’s gone, and the new chairman wants to shake things up… I’m worried. The deal could collapse."

He exhaled sharply. "Ethan was the backbone of Blackwood Group. Without him, the company is vulnerable. They’re about to sign a strategic agreement with QuantumTech on the Quantum-6 chip. This deal could redefine the tech industry. If it fails, Blackwood Group is finished."

Vivian scoffed. "And what does that have to do with me? How could I possibly help?"

"You can," Julian insisted, a cryptic smile playing on his lips. "Ethan’s fate is uncertain. Rumors are spreading. Blackwood Group has no leader. And people like Julian Blackwood are waiting to strike. Someone needs to step in—someone who can represent Ethan and secure this deal."

Realization dawned on Vivian. She laughed coldly. "You want me to stabilize the company?"

"Exactly."

"You’re insane. I’m his ex-wife. Do you really think the board would accept me? Or are you just desperate for drama?"

Julian’s expression turned grave. "I’m dead serious. The world knows Ethan would move mountains for you. He even starred in Hunt My Everheart to win you back. If you hold a press conference and announce you’ve reconciled, no one would question your authority to act on his behalf."

"Absolutely not." Vivian cut him off sharply. "Marriage isn’t a game. We’re done. Your plan is absurd."

Julian pressed on. "Gaining public trust is just step one. You need to secure QuantumTech’s confidence. Restructure Blackwood Group. Weed out the traitors."

His voice lowered. "And find out who killed Sebastian and Ethan. Give them justice."

"That’s the police’s job. Not mine."

Vivian stood, done with the conversation.

"You don’t care if he’s dead?" Julian challenged. "You won’t even avenge him?"

She turned, her gaze icy. "No. I don’t. You came to the wrong person."

As she walked away, Julian shook his head in disbelief.

When a woman falls out of love, her heart turns to stone.

Poor Ethan. If only you’d known.

Vivian returned home that night, her mind in turmoil.
###Chapter 498

Julian's words made it clear—Blackwood Group was in deep trouble this time. Nathaniel had vanished at the worst possible moment, his fate unknown. Even if he was alive, he'd be fighting an uphill battle.

But why should Vivian care?

Empires rose and fell. Blackwood Group had dominated the industry for decades. Its decline was inevitable.

Even if she agreed to step in for Nathaniel, she couldn't reverse the company's downfall.

Still, curiosity gnawed at her. Who had the audacity to target the Blackwood heir not once, but twice? She opened her laptop, searching for details about Sebastian's murder years ago.

The internet yielded almost nothing. The Blackwoods had clearly scrubbed the records clean.

Sebastian's case had happened five years ago in Newport City. The local police archives might hold answers.

Vivian considered hacking into their system. But Newport PD used an archaic binary key code—her biggest weakness.

Years ago, she'd lost a global hacking competition to Julian Blackthorn because of it. He was the expert in that field.

Asking him for help now? No. He'd been quiet lately, and she wasn't about to invite trouble.

She'd do this herself.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard. Multiple attempts. Multiple failures. Then—alarms blared. The police were tracing her IP.

"Damn it!"

She shut everything down. Not worth the risk. This wasn't her problem anyway.

She had more pressing concerns—Adrian's whereabouts. How was Sophia doing? Had William been rescued? If he survived, would he reveal where Adrian was?

The doorbell rang.

"Who the hell visits this late?"

Vivian slammed her laptop shut and marched to the door.
###Chapter 499

Vivian swung the door open, her heart leaping at the unexpected visitor. Standing there was none other than Adrian!

"Mommy, it's been forever! I missed you so much! Hug me now!"

The impeccably dressed little boy stretched out his arms with practiced ease. His crisp white shirt and neatly combed hair showed no signs of his earlier disappearance.

Vivian's initial shock quickly turned to fury. She crossed her arms, fixing Adrian with her sternest glare. "Adrian Lockhart. Did you enjoy your little adventure before coming to me?"

"You were gone from Coral Haven for barely an hour. How could you? Do you realize how worried we were? Is this your idea of a joke?"

"Relax, Mommy. I'm home safe..."

Adrian shrugged nonchalantly before launching himself into Vivian's arms. His big hazel eyes widened into the perfect puppy-dog expression as he blinked up at her. "You know me, Mommy. What's there to worry about? You're overreacting... But I know it's because you love me too much. Best mommy ever! World's greatest! Love you mostest!"

The little schemer knew exactly how to play Vivian's heartstrings. A few sweet words and that adorable pout usually melted her anger instantly. But not today.

Vivian resisted the urge to pinch his rosy cheeks. "Adrian Lockhart, save the act. It won't work this time. Start talking - what was this stunt really about?"

Seeing his charm offensive fail, Adrian dropped the act immediately. His expression shifted to its usual composed maturity. "Simple. I was concerned about you. Newport City can be dangerous, and I couldn't let my mommy face it alone. Consider me your personal bodyguard."

Vivian pressed her palm to her forehead, fighting off a migraine. Did her four-year-old really just say that?

Sometimes Vivian swore Adrian was the upgraded version of her and Nathaniel. The child operated on a completely different level. In their ongoing battle of wits, Vivian often found herself outmaneuvered.

"You're a child! Staying put is your only job. How could you leave Coral Haven without telling anyone? Traveling alone? What if you'd encountered criminals? You're tiny! Any stranger could have snatched you up!"

"Impossible." Adrian smirked with unshakable confidence. "I'm smarter than common criminals. Anyone who tried anything is already in police custody. This isn't my first rodeo, Mommy. You know that."

Vivian opened her mouth, then closed it. The little devil had a point.

"Mommy, you're missing the bigger picture! I came to protect you. Instead of scolding me, shouldn't you be rewarding your brave little hero?" Adrian reasoned with infuriating logic.

"Reward you?"

Vivian's anger dissolved into disbelieving laughter. Only Adrian could twist the situation so masterfully that staying mad felt unreasonable.

Her smile turned dangerously sweet. "A reward, you say? Wait right here, darling. Mommy will get your special prize."

Adrian beamed triumphantly. "I knew you'd understand! Best mommy in the universe!"

Moments later, Vivian returned with a wooden ruler. Her smile never wavered as she commanded, "On your knees. Hands out."
###Chapter 500

Adrian knew better than to test Vivian's patience this time. He could see the storm brewing in her eyes.

He dropped to his knees immediately, palms outstretched without protest. His small frame remained steady under her furious gaze. "Mommy, hit me if it makes you feel better. Just don't stay angry. I can take the pain."

"Still playing the smart one, aren't you?"

The ruler came down hard across Adrian's tender skin. A bright red mark bloomed instantly. Vivian's voice turned icy. "Do you understand what you did wrong yet?"

Tears pooled in the boy's eyes but didn't fall. He lifted his chin defiantly. "I didn't do anything wrong. Protecting you is never wrong."

"Adrian!" The ruler struck again, harder this time. Vivian's hands trembled with barely contained fury.

Her son was slipping through her fingers lately - too clever for his own good, too reckless with his actions. This lesson needed to stick before he got himself hurt.

Three more sharp cracks echoed through the room. "You stubborn child! I'll keep punishing you until you admit your mistake!"

A sob finally broke free. But even through tears, Adrian remained obstinate. "Hit me all you want, Mommy. I'd rather die than let The Rival hurt you again!"

Vivian froze mid-swing. "What did you just call him?"
