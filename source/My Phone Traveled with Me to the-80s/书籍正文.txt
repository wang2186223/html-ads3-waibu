###Chapter 1: Transmigrated into Motherhood

"Brother, did Mommy abandon us?" A scrawny little boy tugged at the sleeve of his slightly older brother, his voice trembling.

The two boys, dressed in patched clothes, stood before a tightly shut door. It had been two days since they'd last seen their mother. During that time, they'd had to beg for meals at their grandparents' house, only to be mocked by their cousins as "beggars."

The older boy bit his lip, mustered his courage, and tiptoed to the door. He gave it a timid knock before darting back to the corner, torn between hope and fear that the door might suddenly swing open.

"Mommy... Mommy..." the younger boy whimpered, rubbing his growling stomach.

Emily Johnson stirred in her sleep, faintly registering the knocking and the children's voices. She frowned, annoyed. She'd worked late into the night and had planned to sleep in on her day off.

"What time is it...?" she mumbled, groping blindly for her phone. Instead, her fingers brushed against something hard. Her eyes flew open, and she bolted upright in shock.

"Where am I?"

The room before her was unfamiliar—peeling walls, an old wooden chest, and a stiff plank bed beneath her. Where was her spacious apartment? Her smart home system?

"This must be a dream..." She pinched herself, hissing at the sharp pain.

Outside, the childish voices called again: "Mommy..."

Emily froze. Mommy? She didn’t even have a boyfriend, let alone children. Unless...

A terrifying thought struck her—had she been kidnapped?

She tried to get up, but her legs felt weak, and a sharp ache twisted her stomach. Spotting an old-fashioned phone on the bedside table, she grabbed it frantically, intending to call the police—only to find it couldn’t even locate her position.

"What the hell is going on...?" she muttered, just as a wave of dizziness hit her. Fragments of last night—leaving work—flashed through her mind...
###Chapter 2: Transmigrated as the Cannon Fodder Female Lead

"Ding-dong—" A notification chimed from Emily Johnson's phone as she gripped the steering wheel with one hand, glancing at the screen. It was a voice message from her mother.

"Emily, your cousin's baby is already a month old. When are you bringing a boyfriend home?" Mrs. Fan's voice echoed through the car speakers. "Oh, and help me with this PennyDeals deal! Just one more click!"

Emily rolled her eyes and expertly opened the PennyDeals link. Just as she raised the phone to her face, the tires hit a rock, jolting the car violently.

Thud!

The phone smacked hard against her forehead. A sharp pain shot through her skull, and darkness swallowed her vision.

"Damn, this can't be happening..." were her last thoughts before she blacked out.

When she opened her eyes again, Emily found herself lying on a hard wooden bed. A patched-up mosquito net hung above her, and the air smelled of firewood.

"Where am I?"

Instinctively, she reached into her pocket—and to her shock, her phone was still there. The screen lit up, displaying the PennyDeals interface.

Ding— The phone vibrated with a new notification.

Emily's pupils constricted.

Wasn't this the period novel she had binge-read last night?

Fragments of memories suddenly flooded her mind, the pain so intense she curled into a ball. When it finally subsided, she understood what had happened.

She had transmigrated.

Into the book.

As the cannon-fodder female lead—the male lead's ex-wife.

In the original story, the character also named Emily Johnson despised rural life and constantly schemed to return to the city. While the male lead was away on business, she abandoned her two young children and fled back to the city. As a result, her youngest son suffered permanent disability from untreated high fever.

Later, the male lead took the children to the city, where he met the female lead—a college graduate who not only cured the boy's hearing but also gave birth to a daughter, completing their happy family of five.

And the original Emily? After returning to the city, she married an abusive man and was eventually beaten to death.

"This is too cruel..." Emily wanted to cry but had no tears left.

She looked around—the earthen walls, the kerosene lamp, the chipped enamel mug—this was unmistakably the countryside of the late 1970s.

"Mom, I'm hungry." A timid voice came from the doorway.

Emily turned to see a boy about five years old standing by the doorframe, holding a toddler no older than three. Both children were painfully thin, their clothes patched and worn.

These were the two sons she had abandoned in the original story.

The older one was David, the younger Tommy.

Emily's heart clenched. According to the plot, in just a few days, she was supposed to abandon them and run away.

"Wait here. I'll make you something to eat," she heard herself say.

In the kitchen, Emily fumbled with starting a fire. Thick smoke choked her, making her cough until tears streamed down her face.

"Mom, let me help." David appeared behind her, skillfully taking the fire tongs from her hands.

Watching the child's practiced movements, Emily's nose stung.

What five-year-old should know how to do this? Just how neglectful had the original Emily been?

At the table, the two boys devoured the simple corn porridge. Tommy, with grains stuck to his lips, looked up at her with a bright smile. "Mom, this is delicious."

Emily's eyes burned.

She made a decision then and there.

To hell with the plot! To hell with the female lead! These two children—she was keeping them!

As for the male lead... She'd deal with him when he returned. According to the original story, he was currently in the south trading electronic watches and wouldn't be back anytime soon.

Ding— Her phone buzzed again.

Emily looked down. The PennyDeals screen now displayed: Deal Successful!

Below it, in smaller text: Congratulations! You've received a Transmigration Starter Pack. Claim now?

Her heartbeat quickened.
###Chapter 3: The Secret of the Mysterious Phone

Emily Johnson stared at the smartphone in her hand, her heart racing. This phone had somehow traveled through time with her to the 1980s!

"Could this be my golden finger?" she murmured, swiping her fingers across the screen.

Hunger gnawed at her, prompting her to test the online shopping feature first. With practiced ease, she opened the shopping app and selected a box of bread.

"Fingerprint payment..." She held her breath as she pressed her finger to the screen.

"Payment successful!"

Emily's eyes widened as a cardboard box materialized out of thin air beside the bed.

"It really works!" Trembling, she tore open the packaging, and the aroma of fresh bread filled the air.

She devoured two slices before ordering a carton of milk. When the milk appeared before her, she finally accepted that this wasn’t a hallucination.

"Mom..." A timid voice called from outside the door.

Emily suddenly remembered—the original owner of this body had two children. Quickly hiding the food, she smoothed her clothes and went to open the door.

The moment the door creaked open, her elder son, David, darted back into the room like a frightened rabbit.

"Am I that scary?" Emily touched her face, puzzled.

Inside the room, little Tommy rubbed his stomach. "Brother, I'm so hungry..."

"Don't go out!" David clutched his younger brother's sleeve. "I'll get us something to eat."

Emily sighed and retrieved the bread and milk. Now she had to figure out how to explain the modern packaging.

"Kids, dinner's ready," she called softly.

Through the crack in the door, two pairs of wary eyes studied her. Emily placed the food on the table and took several steps back.

"Mom bought these from town. Come and eat."

Tommy's stomach growled loudly, but David still held him back. Watching the pitiful brothers, Emily felt a pang in her chest.

"Winning their trust won't be easy," she thought to herself.
###Chapter 4: The Desperate Little Ones

"Brother..." Tommy tried to grab David's sleeve, but his older brother yanked him out of the room.

David tiptoed to the main hall doorway but hesitated to enter. He stood on his toes, peeking through the crack in the door.

"David? Where's your brother?"

Emily's heart sank when she spotted the small head poking through the door. In her memories, the male lead had just left for work, but this child didn't look five at all. His tiny frame was swallowed by a patched gray shirt, his face smudged with dirt, and his cloth shoes worn through, revealing grimy toes.

He was so thin!

David strained on his tiptoes but could only see the edge of the table. Yet the mouthwatering aroma filled his nose, making him swallow hard.

"Mom..." he whispered timidly, though his eyes remained fixed on the table.

"Go get Tommy. Let's eat together," Emily said gently, forcing a smile.

David clenched his shirt. Bring his brother? What if Mom changed her mind again?

But she had smiled at him today! Ever since Dad left, she rarely smiled at them. Sometimes she wouldn't cook all day, and they'd have to scavenge for wild berries or sneak to their grandparents' for food.

"Go on. I promise I won't hit you." Seeing his hesitation, Emily's heart ached. What had the original owner done to make this child so afraid?

David bit his lip. Fine—he'd take the risk! If they got beaten, he'd shield Tommy.

He dashed back to the room, dragging Tommy toward the main hall. Tommy shrank back in fear, but his brother pulled him forward.

Now Emily saw Tommy clearly—a scrawny little thing drowning in oversized clothes, his face so dirty she could barely make out his features.

Growl— Both boys' stomachs rumbled in unison.

"Mom..." Tommy hid behind David, his voice barely audible.

Emily sighed. "Let's eat first."

The boys climbed onto their stools and saw small bowls of milky liquid and a few pastries set before them.

"This is powdered milk, and some treats from town. I'll make something better for dinner." Emily winced inwardly—her cooking skills were nothing to brag about.

The boys exchanged glances and made a silent pact—eat first, worry later! Even if they got beaten, at least they'd be full!

As the first sip of warm milk slid down his throat, the rich creaminess exploded in David's mouth. For a fleeting moment, he remembered—the last time he'd tasted something this good was when Dad bought that can of powdered milk after Tommy was born.
###Chapter 5: Transmigrated as the Villainess

"This is sponge cake. It tastes even better with milk," Emily Johnson coaxed the two children gently.

The little boys timidly reached for the bread, stealing glances at her before taking small, cautious bites.

"Is it good?" She softened her voice as much as possible.

David hesitated before whispering, "Yes." He immediately hunched his shoulders, as if expecting a slap any second.

"Take your time." Emily stood up and headed to the kitchen, relieved. The wood-burning stove had been a nightmare. As a modern office worker, she could barely handle a gas stove, let alone this primitive method.

"Brother, Mommy didn't hit us today," Tommy whispered to David, his voice barely audible.

David frowned. Something was off about their mother today. Not only had she given them such expensive treats, but she'd even made them milk. Was she... planning to abandon them and return to the city?

"Eat fast," David urged his brother, though his own stomach twisted with unease.

Meanwhile, at the Stone family home.

"It's already noon—why haven't the boys come for lunch?" Mary Stone set down her chopsticks, her brow furrowed. Had that city-bred daughter-in-law of hers caused trouble again?

Unable to sit still, Mary hurried toward her youngest son's house.

"David! Tommy!" Pushing open the half-closed gate, she spotted her grandsons holding bowls.

"Grandma!" The boys called out as if she were their savior.

In the kitchen, Emily dropped the fire poker with a loud clang. Oh no—her mother-in-law! How was she supposed to handle this when she was stuck in the role of the story's villainess?

"Grandma, I'll put my bowl away!" David mustered his courage to dash into the kitchen, tossed his bowl onto the counter, and bolted back outside.

Mary held Tommy's hand, noticing the sweet milky scent on him. Had that wasteful daughter-in-law actually given the children malt extract?

Watching David flee, Emily sighed. The original owner must have abused these kids terribly for them to be this scared.

"What did you have for lunch?" Mary crouched to wipe Tommy's dirty face.

Just as David opened his mouth to answer—

BANG!

A loud crash came from the kitchen.

###Chapter 6: Secrets Beneath the Scars

"Powdered milk and sponge cake."

Emily Johnson froze. No hot meal? Just this?

"Grandma, the cake is yummy!" Tommy patted his round little belly, eyes sparkling.

Mary Stone rose hastily. "Come to Grandma's if you're still hungry." She dared not linger, fearing her daughter-in-law might cause another scene. The vegetable plot awaited her attention.

"Yeah." David responded quietly, recalling his cousins' warning: another visit to Grandma's would earn him a beating.

Watching Mary's retreating figure, Emily's heart grew heavy. The original host had fought tooth and nail to marry into the Stone family, yet now...

In the kitchen, the kettle bubbled noisily. Emily filled thermoses, then boiled a large pot of water. Those two grimy boys were unbearable to look at.

"David! Tommy! Bath time!"

By the courtyard wall, two small figures froze mid-creep toward the gate.

"We... aren't dirty." David stared at his grubby hands, voice fading.

"Now! Immediately!" Emily's sharp tone made Tommy clutch his brother's shirt, face pale. "Davey..."

"Don't be scared."

The wooden tub brimmed with warm water. Emily rummaged for clean clothes before resorting to PennyDeals for period-appropriate outfits.

"Know how to use soap?"

David obediently climbed in, clumsily scrubbing. When Emily approached to help, she froze—

Their backs were mottled with bruises, their bottoms striped with cane marks. At her approach, both small bodies tensed.

These injuries... had the original host done this?

No wonder the boys trembled around her. What had they endured when Michael was away?

Warm water revealed two pale, delicate faces beneath the grime—and ribs protruding painfully through thin skin.

"New clothes. New shoes."

Tommy timidly touched the rubber boots, wide-eyed with confusion. Mom was acting so strange today—tasty food, fresh outfits...

"What would you like for dinner?"

"Meat..." Tommy's whisper was barely audible before he hid behind David.

Emily's throat tightened. Was this the first time the child dared voice a wish?
###Chapter 7: The Secret of PennyDeals

"Mommy..." Tommy stood timidly at the door, his small hands nervously twisting the hem of his shirt. His thin cheeks bore two bright patches of red, and his malnourished hair had a dull, yellowish tint.

Emily Johnson crouched down to meet his eye level. "Would you like some chicken?"

Tommy froze, his wide eyes filled with disbelief. He had expected another scolding—not this.

"Y-yes..." His voice was barely a whisper.

Soon, the tantalizing aroma of chestnut stewed chicken filled the kitchen. The rich scent made the two little boys fidget like hungry kittens by the doorway.

"David, it smells so good..." Tommy swallowed hard.

David kept a wary eye on their mother's busy figure, his small hand gripping his brother's shirt tightly. New clothes, new shoes, and now meat? None of this felt real.

Only when a steaming chicken leg was placed in his hand did David dare believe it. He took a careful bite, and the savory juices burst in his mouth.

"Slow down," Emily said, her heart aching as she watched them devour the food. In this era, even meat was a luxury for children.

"Tomorrow, we'll go pick wild berries in the hills," she mused, making a mental note to familiarize herself with local edible plants. If she accidentally bought exotic fruits from her phone, it would raise suspicions.

"But there are wild boars in the hills!" David suddenly looked up, his greasy face creased with worry. "Daddy never lets us go."

Wild boars? Emily tensed. The wilderness here wasn't as safe as in modern times.

"Then... we'll just stay near the foot of the hills."

After dinner, David volunteered to wash the dishes. Emily watched the tiny boy—barely taller than the stove—and felt her heart melt.

"Good job!" She ruffled his hair, noticing how he stiffened slightly at her touch.

Late at night, Emily lay in bed studying her phone. PennyDeals was the only app that worked, but strangely, her attempt to buy pork again failed.

"Only one purchase per day?" Frowning, she scrolled through her order history and noticed a pattern—there seemed to be a limit on items of the same category.

She quickly placed orders for a solar charger and two more sets of clothes. For underwear, she chose modest vests—anything too revealing wouldn’t do in this era.

"What kind of system is this...?" Muttering to herself, she washed the new clothes. She had no intention of wearing the original undergarments.

Tiptoeing to the children’s room, she peeked through the window. Moonlight bathed their faces, which finally showed a hint of healthy color.

"Cock-a-doodle-doo—"

Before dawn, the rooster's crow jolted Emily awake. Rubbing her temples, she realized a serious problem:

In a world without alarm clocks, how was she supposed to sleep in?
###Chapter 8: The New Clothes Incident

Morning sunlight streamed through the window as Emily Johnson opened her eyes, finding herself still lying in the adobe house.

She sat up abruptly and pinched her arm—ouch!

"I really didn't go back..." she murmured, staring at her rough hands.

In the kitchen, Emily fumbled with lighting the fire. The kettle bubbled as she tossed a few eggs into the pot.

"Mom..."

Two little boys stood at the door, already dressed. David held Tommy's hand, their clothes slightly crooked but at least properly worn.

"Go wash your hands," Emily said without looking up.

The table was set with steaming milk, eggs, and leftover chicken from last night. The boys' eyes widened.

"Mom, you should have the powdered milk..." David said hesitantly.

"It's about to expire. Drink it all," Emily insisted firmly.

No way was she the type to sacrifice herself. Good things should be shared—why should adults always give way to kids?

"What's 'expire'?" Tommy tilted his head.

"It means... it'll go bad," Emily struggled to explain. "Like... when bread gets moldy after sitting too long. If you eat it, your stomach will hurt."

The boys nodded vaguely and sipped their milk carefully.

"David, we're going to pick vegetables later," Emily announced suddenly.

She needed to get familiar with this household. The original owner's memories were like a fragmented film, with crucial scenes always blurry.

"Okay!" David answered brightly, though his eyes lingered on his new shoes.

Before leaving, the boys insisted on changing into their old clothes. Emily rummaged through the chest but only found a few patched-up cotton jackets.

"Wear these," she pointed to the new outfits they already had on. "Let's go."

Walking along the country path, Emily tried identifying the crops in the fields. Eggplants? Potatoes? Were they in season?

"Mom, lock the door," David reminded her.

Emily scrambled for the key, finally managing to lock up—only to realize she'd forgotten the vegetable basket. Luckily, David was quick-witted and grabbed a bamboo basket from behind the door.

"Mom..." David hesitated.

They hadn't gone far when a group of children surrounded them.

"Wow! New clothes!" a girl with braids exclaimed.

David immediately puffed out his chest. "My mom made them!"

Tommy eagerly lifted his foot to show off his new cotton shoes. "So warm!"

Emily watched the group of thin, sallow-faced children. Their ill-fitting old clothes hung loosely, some wearing straw sandals, their fingers red from the cold.

"David's mom is so nice..." the children murmured enviously.

Then a shrill voice cut through:

"Liar! She was hitting you just days ago!"

Emily's heart skipped a beat. A tall, skinny boy stood at the edge of the crowd, a malicious grin on his face.

The air froze instantly.
###Chapter 9: Michael's Decision

"Hey, do I look invisible to you? How dare you gossip right in front of me?" Michael Stone's icy tone instantly silenced the group of children.

"David, Tommy, let's go home."

Just as David was about to argue back, Emily Johnson's gentle voice intervened. The two boys immediately trailed behind her like little ducklings, skipping away cheerfully.

The other children exchanged uneasy glances before scattering in all directions.

News traveled faster than the wind in the village. By noon, word of Emily dressing the children in new clothes had spread throughout the entire production team.

At that moment, Emily was picking vegetables with the boys in their private plot—a neatly tended piece of land not far from their home.

"Mom, I always bring Tommy here to pull weeds," David said proudly. At five years old, he was still too young for school, as most village children didn't start until seven or eight.

"You're such a good helper," Emily praised, ruffling his hair.

Meanwhile, on a remote path outside the county town—

"Third Brother, we'll strike it rich once we sell this batch!" Charles Clark, his skin darkened by the sun, rubbed his hands together eagerly.

Michael narrowed his eyes as he surveyed the road ahead. Standing at six feet tall, he cut an imposing figure even in his rough-spun clothes, his sharp presence impossible to ignore.

"Third Brother, is your wife still giving you trouble?" Daniel River asked cautiously. As Michael's cousin, he both respected and feared the man.

At the mention of Emily, Michael's expression darkened. "She wants to return to the city."

"Honestly, you should take her and the kids to visit her family," Samuel Bright suggested, adjusting his glasses. The slender young man served as the group's strategist. "She hasn't been back since coming to the countryside—it's natural to miss home."

Charles chimed in, "Exactly! My girl gets excited for days if I buy her a hairpin."

Daniel and Samuel exchanged a look—this fool was wrapped around his sweetheart's finger again.

Michael gazed into the distance. He'd been away for half a month—had her anger cooled? This time, he'd bring back something special for her.

Just then, seven or eight burly men suddenly blocked their path.

"Hand over the goods, Stone, and we might let you walk away alive!"

Michael smirked and cracked his knuckles. "You're asking for death."

Before the words fully left his mouth, he lunged forward like a tiger. This was already the third ambush in two weeks.
###Chapter 10: Seeds of Jealousy

"Emily Johnson..."

Emily was crouched in the vegetable patch, inspecting the growth of the potatoes. The tender green leaves stretched under the sunlight. Suddenly, she heard someone call her name and looked up to see a woman in patched clothing standing on the ridge of the field.

"Yes?"

She quickly searched the original host's memories but found no trace of this face. After all, in the original story, she was merely a foil to the female lead—many villagers didn’t even have names.

"Emily, don’t you want to return to the city?" The woman’s voice carried a probing tone.

Return to the city?

Emily scoffed inwardly. The original host had died because of that very obsession. If she hadn’t been so desperate to go back, the female lead would never have had the chance to rise.

"Aunt Olivia!" David suddenly stepped in front of Emily, eyeing the woman warily.

Only then did Emily remember—this was Olivia Brown, another educated youth who had been sent to the village. She had married into the poorest family, the Lees, and given birth to two daughters, living a life of hardship.

Olivia’s gaze lingered on Emily’s fair skin and neat clothes, a flicker of envy flashing in her eyes. They were both educated youths, yet Emily had married the village chief’s son, borne two sons, and never had to toil in the fields. While she...

"David, your mother will go back to the city sooner or later," Olivia lowered her voice. "City folk don’t stay in the countryside forever. What will happen to you and your brother then—"

"Aunt Olivia," Emily cut her off, rising slowly to her feet. "My family matters are none of your concern. Shouldn’t you be working at this hour?"

She brushed the dirt from her hands, her tone gentle but edged with steel. "You chose this path—now you must walk it to the end. Instead of gossiping here, you should focus on improving your own life."

Olivia’s face flushed with anger before she finally shot Emily a glare and stormed off.

"Mom, let’s go home!" Tommy tugged at Emily’s sleeve, his small face creased with worry.

"Alright." Emily picked a few eggplants and green peppers before taking the children’s hands and heading back.

On the way, David suddenly declared, "Mom, Aunt Olivia is bad. I’m going to beat up her daughter Daisy!"

Emily stopped in her tracks.

Where had this thought come from?

"No," she knelt down, meeting David’s eyes seriously. "Just because someone does something wrong doesn’t mean we should too. Remember—violence is never the answer."

The two boys nodded, though they didn’t fully understand.

As they walked home, Emily felt countless eyes on her. The hushed whispers buzzed around her like flies, making her skin crawl.

Finally, they reached the house. Closing the door behind her, she exhaled deeply, first placing the vegetables in the kitchen before hurrying to check her phone, which was charging.

The solar charger’s indicator light blinked—the battery had reached 78%. Emily ran her fingers over the smooth screen. This phone was her only connection to the world she had left behind.
###Chapter 11: The Bully Gets What He Deserves

Emily Johnson surveyed the simple adobe house, contemplating how to make it more comfortable. Suddenly, rapid knocking at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Emily! Emily! Something bad happened!" a child's shrill voice called from outside.

It took Emily a moment to realize the child was addressing her. She quickly pulled the door open to find a red-faced little boy—the same one who had admired David and Tommy’s new clothes a few days ago—standing breathlessly on her doorstep.

"What's wrong?" Her heart clenched with worry.

"Come quick!" The boy stamped his foot impatiently.

Emily locked the door and followed him at a jog. Along the way, she pieced together the story: Richard, the older boy, had seen David in his new clothes and tried to snatch them, claiming that since David and Tommy often ate at his house, the clothes should count as payment.

"What?" Emily stopped mid-stride, fury flaring. This was outright bullying!

Before they even reached the scene, she heard Tommy’s heart-wrenching sobs, his voice hoarse from crying. The crowd of children parted as Emily rushed forward.

"Move!" She pushed through and saw David sitting on the ground, blood trickling from his forehead, while Tommy wept uncontrollably beside him.

A stocky boy—Richard—tried to slip away, but Emily grabbed him by the collar.

"Did you hurt my son?" Her voice was icy.

"Let me go!" The boy struggled. "I’ll tell my mom, and she’ll beat you up!"

Oh, so he was a bully and a coward. Emily scoffed. "You pick on my kid, then threaten to have your mother come after me?"

She released him, sending him stumbling to the ground. Ignoring him, she scooped David into her arms and called to Tommy, "Come on, let’s go home."

David’s forehead was still bleeding, and Emily’s chest ached. The boy was already malnourished—losing blood was the last thing he needed.

"David, does it hurt?" she asked softly.

The boy froze in her arms. His mother wasn’t scolding him for ruining his clothes—she was comforting him? He bit his lip and shook his head. "N-no."

"Sweetheart, it’s okay to cry if it hurts." She quickened her pace. "Next time, if you can’t fight back, run. If you can’t run, call for help. And if all else fails..." She lowered her voice. "Find a way to get back at them quietly."

David blinked, nodding uncertainly.

Meanwhile, Richard had already bolted home to tattle. Emily knew this wasn’t over—bigger trouble was coming.
###Chapter 12: Emily's Wrath

Sunlight streamed through the window into the main room, illuminating David’s pale face, his forehead wrapped in gauze. Emily Johnson’s heart ached as she gently touched his head before turning to fetch water from the kitchen.

"Mommy..." David called timidly.

"Don’t be afraid, I'm here," Emily reassured him, handing him the cup with a soft voice.

Suddenly, a commotion erupted in the yard.

"Emily Johnson, come out here right now!" Patricia Stone’s shrill voice echoed from beyond the gate.

Little Tommy hid behind his brother, frightened. Emily’s eyes hardened as she strode toward the entrance.

"What do you want?" she asked coldly, facing the furious mother and son.

Patricia yanked her son forward. "Look what your boy did to mine!"

Emily glanced at the faint red mark on Richard’s arm and scoffed. "That’s it?"

"What do you mean?" Patricia’s eyes bulged with outrage.

"Your son pushed David down and split his forehead open," Emily retorted, pointing inside. "Would you like to see the wound?"

Patricia faltered for a second before snapping, "Kids roughhouse all the time!"

"Oh?" Emily narrowed her eyes. "Then it’s perfectly fine if I roughhouse your son right now?"

A crowd of villagers had gathered, murmuring among themselves. "Since when did Emily become so bold?"

Patricia, incensed, rolled up her sleeves and lunged. "I’ll teach you a lesson today!"

Emily didn’t retreat—instead, she seized Patricia’s wrist. "Looking for a fight?"

As they stood locked in tension, Elizabeth Stone rushed over. "Stop this at once!"

Patricia wrenched her arm free and hissed, "You’ll regret this!"

Emily smirked. "I’ll be waiting. But remember—if you lay a finger on my son again, you’ll wish you hadn’t."

The onlookers gaped. Was this really the same delicate Emily they knew?

Elizabeth pulled Emily inside, whispering anxiously, "Why provoke her? She’s notorious for her temper."

Emily handed each boy a piece of candy and replied calmly, "For my children, I’ll stand up to anyone."

Her gaze drifted to the window, resolute. This time, she wouldn’t back down.

In the distance, Patricia dragged Richard toward the brigade office, loudly demanding justice from John Stone Sr.

The real drama had only just begun.
###Chapter 13: The Guilty Party Files First

Elizabeth Stone forced a bitter smile. "Those two sisters-in-law of mine only ever exchange sharp words."

She had no interest in getting involved in such thankless matters.

Her politeness toward Patricia was merely superficial.

If they came to blows, she couldn’t care less who won.

Both sisters-in-law had two sons each, unlike her—three daughters before finally bearing a son. Back then, she couldn’t even hold her head high in the Stone household.

Patricia had never missed a chance to mock her. The grudge between them ran deep.

Her son was the same age as Tommy.

That brat Richard constantly bullied her boy, and whenever she confronted Patricia about it, the woman would dismiss it as "kids being kids."

It made her blood boil.

This son of hers was the one she had prayed for night and day—of course she treasured him.

Meanwhile, Patricia stormed toward Emily Johnson’s house, dragging her son behind her.

"Emily Johnson, get out here!"

The furious shout instantly silenced the main room.

"Patricia’s here."

Emily smirked. She hadn’t even gone to settle the score yet, and the aggressor was already at her door.

"Mom... Aunt Patricia is here."

Aunt Patricia?

Amid Patricia’s shouting, a young woman barged in, pulling a boy along.

"Emily Johnson, how dare you hit my son? Pay up!"

Emily barely spared her a glance.

"Pay up? Your son beat David bloody—he’ll need weeks of good meals to recover. I haven’t even come for you yet, and here you are demanding compensation? Perfect. Let’s settle this properly."

"David, come here. Show this victim what her precious boy did. Stealing clothes and throwing punches—why not just rob a bank while you’re at it?"

Patricia froze. Since when had this sister-in-law become so sharp-tongued?

Seeing his mother hesitate, Richard panicked. "Mom, she hit me! You said everything in the Stone family is mine! David’s new clothes should be mine too! I don’t have any new clothes—why does he get to wear them?"

"Why don’t you just claim the whole country while you’re at it? I’ve seen shameless people, but never one as brazen as you. Taking what belongs to others—do you think the whole nation was birthed by your mother?"

Emily wasn’t one to be bullied. As an only child, she had grown up independent and never lacked for anything.

Patricia didn’t care. Her son had been struck, and Emily would pay.

"Look at his head—he’s injured! If his studies suffer because of this, it’s on you! You’re paying for medical bills, nutrition, lost wages, and my time caring for him!"

Only then did Patricia notice the bandage wrapped around David’s head.

"I have witnesses—everyone saw your boy bullying David and Tommy. You say I hit your son? Where’s your proof? Show me the marks. No evidence? Then this is extortion!"

Patricia was stunned. Since when had this woman become so articulate?

"Richard bullied David and Tommy!"
"Yeah, we all saw it!"

The children, having enjoyed Emily’s White Rabbit candies, naturally sided with her. Besides, Richard did pick on the boys often.

"You did hit me! You did!" Richard, red-faced at the accusations, suddenly charged at Emily.

She sidestepped smoothly, and the boy faceplanted into the dirt.
###Chapter 14: Eye for an Eye, Double the Payback

"Waaah—" Richard suddenly burst into loud sobs, snot and tears smearing across his face.

Patricia Stone rushed forward in three quick strides.

She yanked her son up and immediately lunged at Emily Johnson.

"Get inside!" Emily had already braced herself, shielding the children behind her.

Memories of being bullied by boys in her childhood flashed vividly in her mind.

Mrs. Fan had signed her up for martial arts classes without hesitation.

Five years of training had honed her skills.

"How dare you touch my son? I'll tear you apart!"

Emily pivoted sideways, her right leg snapping out like a whip, followed by a sharp straight punch.

David and Tommy huddled behind the doorframe, tiny hands gripping the wood tightly.

This aunt was the meanest.

Every time they went over for meals, she called them little beggars.

Patricia staggered back from the kick, her hand shooting out to grab Emily’s braid.

Village women always went for the hair first in a fight.

But Emily wasn’t about to give her the chance.

Fists and feet rained down, keeping Patricia at bay.

Someone had already run to fetch the village chief.

"Ahh—!" Patricia had never suffered defeat since marrying into the Stone family. The pain only fueled her rage.

With Michael away, who would protect this little wretch?

Emily deliberately held back—just enough to make her suffer.

Judging by the brat’s bullying tactics, he must have tormented David and Tommy often.

She couldn’t take it out on the child, so the mother would pay instead!

Behind every brat was a rotten parent.

Today, she’d deliver justice herself.

That smug look earlier had been downright infuriating.

Left hook, right sweep—each strike aimed for the most painful spots.

Patricia tried to dodge, to fight back, but couldn’t even graze Emily’s clothes.

The two little ones stomped anxiously.

Seeing his mother losing, Richard swung a fist at David.

The kids who’d earlier accepted Emily’s candies swarmed him, pinning him down and pummeling him until he wailed for mercy.

Hearing her son’s cries, Patricia tried to intervene, but Emily tripped her flat.

Harvest season had just ended, and the fields still needed sowing. The villagers were all busy working.

Thanks to Michael, Emily rarely labored in the fields.

"Stop! Stop hitting me! Hit her instead! Hit my mom!" Richard begged through bruised sobs.

Rapid footsteps approached.

"Enough!"

Everyone turned to see a man in his fifties striding over—John Stone Sr., the village chief and Michael’s father.

His roar froze the scene.

Seeing his daughter-in-law picking fights, the chief’s face darkened with fury.

"Disgraceful!"

Villagers who’d come to gawk whispered and pointed.

"Grandpa—" Tommy suddenly wailed, his small finger pointing at David’s bandaged head. "Brother bled so much... so much blood..."
###Chapter 15: Whose Brat Is This?

"Grandpa, Richard hit me!" Tommy's tearful voice made John Stone Sr. spin around.

Only then did he notice the thick bandage wrapped around David's forehead, with small spots of blood seeping through the white gauze.

"And they stole my brother's new clothes!" Tommy tugged at his dirty shirt, adding indignantly.

John's face darkened as he took in the sight of his grandsons' once-new outfits now covered in mud.

"Dad, it was Emily who hit Richard first!" Patricia shrieked, her voice shrill enough to grate on the ears.

Emily released her grip on Patricia and calmly straightened her collar.

"Dad..." Her voice was steady, yet carried undeniable authority.

John's stomach twisted. Before Michael left, he had repeatedly asked him to look after his wife and children. But now, this mess...

"Dad, perhaps we should hear what the children have to say." Emily pulled forward a young boy who had been watching the commotion and crouched down to his level. "Sweetheart, can you tell us what happened?"

Just then, Mary Stone rushed over. Spotting Emily standing unharmed in the distance, she finally let out a small sigh of relief.

"Oh my! What happened to David's head?" Mary's heart ached at the sight of the bandage, and she stomped her foot in distress.

The little boy, now put on the spot, nervously recounted the events. The gathered crowd immediately erupted in murmurs of disapproval.

"Dad, Richard is only ten and already stealing. What will he do when he grows up?" Emily remarked pointedly. "If he isn't disciplined now, who knows what he'll turn into?"

John's face flushed red, then paled.

"Richard, apologize!" he barked.

Richard muttered a reluctant "sorry" before turning and bolting.

"You always favor them!" Patricia spat before chasing after her son.

Emily smirked. Favoritism? David was bleeding, and all they got was a half-hearted apology?

"Everyone, go home!" John waved his hand, and the crowd quickly dispersed.

Only the elderly couple and Emily's family remained in the yard.

"Grandma, it hurts..." David's lips trembled, tears welling in his eyes.

Mary's heart clenched. "Sweetheart, Grandma will make you some eggs to help you feel better."

"Dad, you should have a word with William about this," Emily said calmly. "Cousins should look out for each other, not steal and fight. This behavior can't be ignored."

John coughed awkwardly, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.
###Chapter 16: The Fight That Shook the Village

"For this child's future, you must discipline him properly. He's the eldest grandson of the Stone family!"

Emily Johnson's voice was calm but firm, emphasizing the words "eldest grandson" to make the consequences clear.

John Stone Sr., the brigade leader, was no fool. He understood the underlying message.

It seemed he had underestimated his third son's wife—she had a sharp tongue.

No wonder William's wife had lost to her.

"We'll discipline him properly. I need to get back to work now."

John Stone Sr. left, but Mary Stone stayed behind.

Her heart ached as she examined the wound on David's forehead, then noticed the brand-new clothes and shoes on both grandsons.

Had Emily actually made them new clothes?

She had even bathed them—their skin carried a faint, pleasant scent.

"Grandma, have some candy." Tommy pulled out a piece of White Rabbit Candy from his pocket, holding it up eagerly.

Mary was stunned. White Rabbit Candy was a rare treat these days.

"Grandma doesn’t want it. You eat it, Tommy."

Emily, tidying up the yard, turned and saw the scene.

"Mother..."

Mary looked at her daughter-in-law with mixed emotions. Years ago, when her youngest son—then a troublemaker—had married the prettiest educated youth in the village, she had been overjoyed.

"Mother, my family sent some food. Let me get it for you. Tommy, close the door."

Food? For her?

Tommy happily skipped to shut the door.

"Grandma..."

Mary had only intended to check on her grandsons before heading home. With the busy farming season over, she mostly did household chores now.

Emily brought out two cans of powdered milk and prepared a bowl for each of them.

"I don’t need any. Give David extra."

"It’s already made. Let it cool before drinking."

The rich aroma of milk filled the air.

The two boys stared eagerly at the steaming bowls, swallowing hard.

"Mother, try this new sponge cake."

Mary was surprised. Since when had Emily become so generous?

"Were you sick a few days ago?"

"Yes, I had a fever..."

"Grandma, it’s so good!"

Mary stopped refusing. She sipped the milk and nibbled on the soft sponge cake.

"William’s wife won’t let this go. Be careful," Mary warned.

Of her three sons, she favored the youngest the most—and naturally, she adored the well-behaved David and Tommy.

"I should head back."

Mary planned to bring some eggs later to nourish her grandsons.

Even though Emily had plenty of food, those were her own supplies.

After Mary left, Emily told the boys to rest indoors and not go out to play.

Yet by noon, news of her fight with Margaret Wilson had spread through the entire production brigade.

"Did you hear? Emily Johnson beat up Margaret Wilson!"

"Really? That delicate city girl?"

"Absolutely true! Margaret still had marks on her face!"

The villagers chattered excitedly. No one had expected the usually gentle Emily to take down the notorious troublemaker Margaret.

Like wildfire, the news spread across Stone Village before the day was over.
###Chapter 17: The Trouble with Meat

"Richard bullied David! He tore his new clothes and made him bleed!"

William Stone was working in the field when he heard the news. He threw down his hoe and ran home. Without a word, he grabbed a broom and started beating Richard, making the boy howl in pain.

Patricia tried to intervene, but her father-in-law John Sr. barked, "Let him teach the boy a lesson!"

Robert and Elizabeth watched coldly. They remembered clearly how often their nephew had bullied their own children.

After the beating, Richard cried himself to sleep without dinner. Patricia wiped her tears, the bruises from Emily's beating still aching on her body.

"I won't swallow this insult!" Patricia gritted her teeth. "When Michael comes back, I'll—"

"Shut up!" William glared. "Have you forgotten how he dealt with us last time?"

Patricia immediately fell silent. She still remembered the beating from last year when Richard stole food from David and Michael caught them. When she complained, Michael avoided her—only to beat her husband later.

"That wretched..." Patricia muttered under her breath.

"Who told them to show off with new clothes when it's not even a holiday?" Patricia fumed. With the limited fabric rations, every family struggled to make ends meet.

Meanwhile, Emily frowned at the eggplants in her kitchen.

"What should I cook for lunch?" she murmured to herself. Noodles? Dumplings? But where would she get meat? The children were young but sharp-eyed.

She decided on braised eggplants with two fried eggs over noodles.

"Mommy, I'm hungry..." Tommy rubbed his belly. Though he'd eaten well at breakfast and had milk powder with cake earlier, his stomach growled again.

David took his brother's hand. "Let's go find Mommy."

The two tiptoed into the kitchen where Emily was busy cooking.

"Mommy..." Tommy called timidly.

Emily turned and her heart melted at the sight of her two little boys. "Why aren't you napping?"

"I'll help with the fire," David said, expertly squatting by the stove.

Emily felt warmth in her chest. "What would you like to eat?"

"Meat!" Tommy's eyes sparkled. "Tommy loves meat best!"

Emily couldn't help but smile. Who didn't crave meat these days?

"And you, David?"

"Anything that fills my stomach," the boy whispered.

Emily's nose stung. His maturity broke her heart.

"Remember," she knelt down seriously, "you mustn't tell anyone about our milk powder and cakes. What if people come to take them away?"

Tommy immediately covered his mouth, his big eyes darting around. David nodded solemnly, his small face tense.

Just then, the courtyard gate burst open—

"Emily Johnson! Get out here now!"
###Chapter 18: The Fox Spirit Rumor

"Mom, we promise not to tell!" The two little boys shook their heads earnestly. Earlier, they had gone out wearing their new clothes, only for their cousin Richard to snatch them away. If people found out they had good food at home, it would surely be stolen too.

With their father away and their mother frail, they had to learn to protect themselves.

Emily Johnson crouched down and patiently explained the harsh realities of human nature through simple stories. The boys listened wide-eyed, absorbing every word.

"So remember, when we have something good, we keep it to ourselves. We don’t show off," Emily said, gently pinching their cheeks. "Otherwise, bad people will come and take it from us."

David and Tommy nodded solemnly, committing their mother’s words to heart. They didn’t know how many times these simple lessons would save them in the future.

Watching her sensible children, Emily felt both pride and sorrow. Once their father returned, she would have to leave. And if she tried to take the boys with her, that man would never allow it.

For lunch, she made egg noodles—nothing special, but the boys ate eagerly.

"Mom’s noodles are the best!" Tommy licked his lips.

Emily suppressed a laugh. Her cooking skills were barely passable, learned only from helping her own mother in the kitchen.

"After we eat, let’s gather firewood," she suggested. Truthfully, she wanted to explore the area. As a "transmigrator," not knowing the village would eventually expose her.

The boys quickly cleared the table and washed the dishes with surprising efficiency.

When they set out, Emily carried a bamboo basket, David a small woven pack, and Tommy insisted on holding the vegetable basket. The little family made their way through the village.

"Emily, where are you off to?" A woman in her thirties called out.

"Auntie, we're gathering firewood," David answered before his mother could.

The woman eyed Emily up and down. "Has Michael returned yet?"

Everyone in the production team envied Emily. Though married to a troublemaker, her husband doted on her—she never had to work in the fields.

"He’ll be back soon," Emily replied vaguely, ushering the children away.

Once they were out of earshot, the woman spat on the ground. "Fox spirit! Only Michael Stone would be fool enough to be bewitched by you. All the other educated youths have returned to the city, but you’ll rot in this village forever!"

Unaware of the gossip, Emily held Tommy’s hand as he skipped along. "Tired?"

"Nope! Full stomach means lots of energy!" Tommy chirped.

For the first time in days, the children had eaten their fill. Emily gazed at the distant mountains and river, her mind racing. Living off the land—this untouched countryside must have resources she could use.

She had once dreamed of retiring to a rustic cottage, embracing a pastoral life. Never had she imagined it would happen this way...
###Chapter 19: A Gift to Cheer Up His Wife

"Henry?" David called out in surprise at the ragged little boy. The child's pants were too short, exposing his dark calves, and his shirt had several holes.

It was lunchtime, and smoke curled from chimneys throughout the village.

"Auntie, David, Tommy..." Henry greeted them timidly.

Emily Johnson studied the skinny boy, her heart aching. Even in modern times, children in impoverished mountain regions still lived such difficult lives.

"My stepmother sent me to gather firewood," Henry muttered, lowering his head.

"But it's mealtime. You should eat first," David said with a frown. He knew Henry's stepmother treated him poorly.

"Let's go gather wood together! Maybe we'll find wild berries too!" Tommy suggested excitedly.

Emily watched the three boys, noting how much thinner Henry looked compared to her sons. She sighed quietly.

In the bamboo grove, Emily showed the children how to collect bamboo husks for kindling.

"You gather here. I'll look for berries," she said, taking the basket from Tommy.

What wild berries could even be found in the autumn mountains? she wondered as she walked.

"Brother, do you think Mom will abandon us?" Tommy asked nervously as he picked up bamboo husks.

Both boys carried the same fear. Their mother's sudden kindness these past two days only made them more uneasy.

They remembered her saying it was because of them that she couldn’t return to the city.

"Michael, are you buying a gift for your wife?" Charles Clark asked as he saw Michael Stone heading toward the department store.

Samuel Bright and Daniel River nearly covered Charles' mouth. Wasn’t it obvious?

With the last batch of goods sold, they could finally go home. Michael clearly wanted to bring his wife a gift to make her happy.

Of their group, Michael was the only one married. The rest were too poor to afford a wife.

"Help me pick something," Michael said bluntly.

The department store was filled with dazzling merchandise.

"Get vanishing cream! And new clothes!" Charles suggested, recalling what village women often talked about.

Michael took his advice and first bought skincare products.

"I'd like a lipstick," he told the sales clerk.

The clerk eyed the group of men before pulling out several tubes. "We have scarlet, rose, and peach..."

Charles scratched his head. "Aren’t they all just for lips? Why so many colors?"

"Which shade would you like?" the clerk asked.

"Michael, the rose one looks nice!" Charles chimed in.

Michael ignored him. "One peach and one scarlet."

"Michael, one is enough..." Samuel whispered. A single tube cost five dollars—far too expensive.

But Michael didn’t hesitate. He also picked out a new dress, spending over a hundred dollars in total.

Wasn’t earning money meant for his wife? That was what he believed.
###Chapter 20: The Secret of a Hundred Bucks

Charles Clark stared at the crisp hundred-dollar bill, his eyes wide with disbelief.

"Michael, this is..."

Michael Stone counted the money expressionlessly. "For her."

A hundred bucks! That was three months' wages for an average worker! Charles swallowed hard but didn’t dare ask further.

Meanwhile, Emily Johnson was busy at the foot of the mountain. She deftly unpacked the fruit, transferring wild grapes and small peaches into a bamboo basket. Afterward, she carefully buried the packaging in the soil.

"Big brother, did Mommy abandon us?" Tommy tugged at David’s sleeve, his eyes red.

David forced a brave face. "No, she didn’t." But his small hands clenched the basket strap so tightly his knuckles turned white.

"Waaah—Mommy—!" Tommy suddenly burst into tears.

"What’s wrong?" Emily hurried over with the basket.

Both boys rushed toward her. Tommy clung to her leg while David gripped the hem of her shirt.

Emily’s heart softened. The original owner’s sins had become her burden.

"Look what I found!" She shook the basket playfully. "Wild grapes and peaches!"

The children’s attention immediately shifted. Henry Wood’s eyes lit up at the sight of the fresh fruit.

"Here." Emily handed Henry a bunch first. "Take some back for your sister."

On the way home, David suddenly spoke up. "Mom, can we give some to Lily?"

Lily? Emily searched her memory for this minor character.

"Go ahead, but don’t let anyone see you," she warned.

The two boys sneaked to the old house like little thieves. David stuffed the grapes into Lily’s pocket and dashed off.

"Sis, what did David give you?" Lucy peeked curiously.

Lily pulled out the glistening purple grapes, and both sisters gasped in surprise.

Meanwhile, Michael stood at the village entrance, the burning hundred-dollar bill still clutched in his hand...
###Chapter 21: Hidden Sweetness

"Come in, quick!" Lily Stone pulled her sister's hand as they tiptoed into their parents' room.

Elizabeth Stone was rocking her youngest son to sleep when she noticed her daughters sneaking in. She lowered her voice. "What's going on?"

"Look, Mom!" Lucy dug into her pocket and pulled out a cluster of deep purple grapes, presenting them like treasure.

Elizabeth's eyes widened. "Where did you—?"

"David gave them to us!" Lily whispered excitedly. "They're so sweet!"

The four of them huddled on the bed, carefully sharing the rare treat. Each grape was so delicious it made them squint with delight—even the baby smacked his lips and grinned.

Meanwhile, the scene at Henry Wood's house was starkly different.

Slap!

The sharp sound of a hand striking flesh echoed across the yard.

"You little thief! How dare you hoard food for yourself!" Henry's stepmother, Lily Wilson, glared at the scrawny boy and snatched the last few grapes from his hand.

Henry clutched his stinging cheek but lifted his chin stubbornly. "Aunt Patricia gave them to me!"

"Which aunt?" His father, George Wilson, stepped out of the house, frowning.

"Mrs. Stone..." Henry mumbled.

The couple exchanged glances, both surprised. The news of Emily Johnson's fight with Patricia Stone had already spread through the entire production team.

"Selfish brat! You didn't even think to share with your brother?" Lily screeched.

George sighed. "Henry, next time you get something good, remember to give some to your little brother."

Behind Henry, his sister Daisy clenched the hem of her shirt, tears welling in her eyes. She remembered how her brother hadn’t even let them lick the wrapper when he got candy last time.

"Yes, Dad," Henry muttered, staring at the ground.

Once the adults were gone, Henry quickly pulled two hidden grapes from his waistband and popped them into Daisy’s mouth.

"Shh—" He pressed a finger to his lips. Seeing her astonished joy, his dirt-streaked face finally broke into a smile.

Meanwhile, Emily Johnson sat at her desk, lost in thought.

What if... I can't go back?

The moment the idea surfaced, it grew like weeds. She abruptly stood and began rummaging through her belongings.

"Just these few?" Emily stared at the handful of tattered textbooks on the table, finally understanding why the original owner had failed the college entrance exam.

She bit her lip, determination hardening in her gaze.

If she couldn’t return for now, she had to prepare to stay. The college entrance exam was her only way out!

Emily opened her PennyDeals system and immediately ordered The Self-Study Series for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. As for English? She had already passed Level Six.

"Next year's exam..." Emily murmured, her fingers absently tapping the desk.

Outside, the setting sun stretched her shadow long across the floor.
###Chapter 22 Country Children Grow Up Fast

Emily Johnson flipped open her physics textbook, her fingers tracing the familiar formulas. Though years had passed since high school, the knowledge seemed etched in her bones. She decided to review both liberal arts and sciences before making a final choice after a month of study.

"Mommy..."

Tommy's sweet voice drifted in from the yard. Emily set the book aside and stepped outside. In the golden evening light, her two boys were staring longingly at the peaches hanging from the tree.

"What's wrong?"

"Mommy, can we have that peach?" David pointed at the ripe red fruit, his little face full of hope.

Emily's heart softened. She crouched to their eye level. "You can have anything in our home. But remember, don't eat too much, or you won't have room for dinner."

She plucked two peaches, carefully washing off the fuzz. Watching the boys happily munching on the fruit, she couldn't help but smile. Such simple joys made them beam with delight.

"Take a nap after this. What would you like for dinner?"

Their eyes lit up. Ever since their mother had changed, this was the first time they'd been given a choice.

"Milk powder!" Tommy blurted eagerly.

"How about sweet potato ball soup tonight, and milk powder tomorrow morning?" Emily suggested gently.

"Okay!" they chorused.

In the kitchen that evening, Emily prepared shrimp paste, mincing the meat and mixing it with a bit of starch. As the balls simmered in the pot, she wondered how to explain why these "sweet potato balls" tasted different.

"Mommy, these are so good!" David said, his mouth shiny with broth.

Tommy nodded vigorously. "Can we have them again tomorrow?"

Emily stifled a laugh. These silly boys couldn't even recognize shrimp. She made a mental note to improve their nutrition.

"We'll try something new tomorrow."

After dinner, the boys efficiently cleared the table. Emily no longer worried about them washing dishes—country children learned to help early in this era.

Before full darkness fell, Emily hurried to heat water for a bath. Though the old house was humble, having a dedicated washroom was a luxury she appreciated.

"Emily! Emily!"

She had just stepped out, drying her hair, when urgent shouts came from the yard. Her pulse quickened—who would visit so late?

David ran to open the gate. A young woman in her early twenties stood there, greeting Emily warmly. "Emily, you're still up?"

Emily studied the stranger warily. The familiarity in her tone suggested she was a friend of the original owner—someone Emily didn't recognize.

"Can I help you?" Emily kept her voice neutral, subtly shielding the boys.

The kerosene lamp cast flickering shadows across the yard as night deepened. The uninvited guest's arrival stirred an uneasy feeling in Emily's chest.
###Chapter 23: Sophia Green the Troublemaker

"Mom, someone's here," David said warily, eyeing the gate.

A woman in a blue cotton dress stood at the entrance, her smile forced. Emily Johnson recognized her—Sophia Green, the village's unmarried educated youth in her thirties.

"Sophia?" Emily was surprised.

Tommy instinctively hid behind his mother. Every time this woman visited, his parents ended up arguing.

"I heard you fought with Mrs. Zhao today?" Sophia's eyes darted around, lingering on the children.

Emily frowned. "Her son bullied David, and she had the nerve to come here making trouble."

Sophia feigned concern with a sigh. "Emily, more and more educated youths are returning to the city these days."

David's head snapped up, his small fingers tightening around his mother's sleeve.

"My family wrote to me, urging me to go back," Sophia deliberately raised her voice. "The city is so lively now—movie theaters, department stores..."

Emily felt both children tense beside her. She glanced down to see David glaring at Sophia, his eyes full of distrust.

"David, Tommy, why don't you go to bed now?" Sophia said with false sweetness.

"No!" Tommy suddenly shouted, startling Emily.

Sophia's smile stiffened before she forced it back. "Emily, are you really content to be a farmer's wife in this backwater forever? The city is so much better..."

Then it clicked. This woman wasn't here out of goodwill.

"Return to the city?" Emily chuckled. "Without a job assignment, I'd just be an unregistered migrant. Sophia, did your family arrange work for you?"

Sophia's expression darkened.

"Besides," Emily pulled her children closer, "I'm married with children now. What would I do in the city? Unlike you—shouldn't you be thinking about settling down at your age?"

Sophia's face flushed crimson. She hated when people brought this up! If only Emily hadn't interfered back then...

"Mom's right!" David declared loudly. "Dad treats Mom really well!"

Shaking with rage, Sophia turned and stormed out, slamming the gate behind her.

Emily knelt to meet her children's eyes. "Tell me, did that woman visit often before?"

David bit his lip and nodded. "Every time she came, she'd talk about the city... Then you and Dad would fight..."

Emily's heart sank. So Sophia Green had been deliberately sowing discord all along.
###Chapter 24: Fake Sisterhood

"Emily Johnson, how dare you trick me?" Sophia Green glared at her, teeth clenched in fury.

She never expected this fool, whom she'd always manipulated with ease, would now turn the tables on her.

"Return to the city?" Sophia sneered, her eyes glinting with malice. "Do you really think your husband would let you go? Even if you divorce, would your parents accept a divorced daughter?"

With that, she turned and stormed off, her retreating figure radiating frustration.

The original Emily might have flown into a rage at such words. But the current Emily simply watched her leave, deep in thought.

What was Sophia really after?

Was she secretly in love with Michael? Or did she just despise the original Emily?

Or... was she simply using this fake sisterhood to mooch off her?

"Mommy..."

The timid voices of the two little boys snapped her out of her thoughts.

"Go to bed early." Emily ruffled their hair before heading to lock the door.

She didn’t notice David’s reddened eyes behind her.

"Brother, Mommy didn’t hit us this time..." Tommy whispered as he climbed into bed.

Last time, right after Daddy left, when Aunt Sophia came over, Mommy had beaten them black and blue and refused to feed them.

"Sleep." David pulled his brother close, silently praying for Daddy to come home soon.

He was terrified Mommy might really leave.

In the dead of night, David’s tears soaked his pillow.

The next morning, Emily was washing clothes by the well when she heard a knock at the gate.

"Emily, going to the market?"

The market?

Emily’s eyes lit up. This was the perfect chance to see what the Supply & Market looked like in this era.

"Wait for me."

She hurried inside and stuffed snacks into the boys’ hands. "Eat these if you get hungry. Mommy’s going to town."

David clutched the milk powder tin, his small hands trembling.

"Mommy..." He mustered his courage and chased her to the door. "Can I come with you?"

Emily paused. "It’s too far. Bringing you two would be inconvenient."

The young woman outside chuckled knowingly. "They don’t want to let you go, huh?"

"Maybe." Emily answered vaguely, though she knew the truth—the boys were afraid she wouldn’t return.

"There’s an ox-cart today. It’ll save us some walking." The woman shook her basket, covered with a cloth. "I’m selling eggs."

As the two walked away, neither noticed David inside, crying his heart out.

"Brother..." Tommy tugged at his sleeve. "Is Mommy leaving us?"

David bit his lip hard, tears splashing onto the ground.

Mommy had given them so much food... Did that mean... she was really leaving?
###Chapter 25: Rumors Spread

"Daddy, when are you coming home?" Tommy pressed his face against the windowsill, his eyes fixed longingly on the road leading out of the village.

Emily Johnson sat on the rickety oxcart, the curious gazes of the village women flickering toward her every now and then.

"Emily, what are you going to town for? Something special?" Mrs. Lee squinted, her tone laced with playful teasing.

Emily tightened her grip on the cloth bundle in her arms and smiled faintly. "Just some everyday necessities."

"Oh, I hear the city's bustling these days. You're not thinking of going back, are you?" another woman chimed in, deliberately raising her voice to draw attention.

Emily was used to these veiled remarks. Ever since she married into the village, the gossip had never stopped.

"Yes, it's been years since I visited my parents. I should check on them," she replied calmly. "I'm also going to the post office to see if they've sent any packages."

The women's expressions shifted instantly. Everyone knew Emily's family often sent valuable goods—just last month, she had received a large parcel of brown sugar and fabric.

Not long after the oxcart left the village, shocking news spread like wildfire: Emily was abandoning her two children to return to the city!

"Disaster!" Patricia Stone barged into the brigade office, breathless. "Dad, Emily packed a suitcase and ran off!"

John Stone Sr. nearly dropped his pipe. "What did you say?"

"It's true! The whole village saw her get on the oxcart with a big suitcase!" Patricia slapped her thigh. "I always said you couldn't trust a city girl!"

Without another word, John stormed toward his third son's house, Patricia trailing behind, already relishing the drama.

Meanwhile, David carefully hid the candy his mother had given him under the bed. Tommy sat on the doorstep, staring at the gate.

"Brother, when will Mommy be back?"

"Soon," David said, patting his little brother's head, though he wasn't so sure himself.

Suddenly, the gate burst open.

"Grandpa!" The boys jumped up in surprise.

John's face was dark with anger. "Where's your mother?"

"Mom went to town to get a package," David said, gripping Tommy's hand tightly.

Patricia huffed as she caught up. "Dad, don't listen to them! Emily ran away!"

"That's not true!" David's eyes welled with tears. "Mom would never leave us!"

Tommy burst into loud sobs, his face turning red. "Mommy... Mommy..."

"Enough!" John's roar made Patricia shrink back.

The yard was filled with nothing but the children's heart-wrenching cries. John looked at his grandsons, his mind in turmoil. With his third son away, what would they do if Emily really was gone?
###Chapter 26: A Farce

"Oh my, isn't this David and Tommy? Why are you crying like this?" Patricia Stone called out in a shrill voice, her eyes darting slyly around.

John Stone Sr. frowned and rapped his pipe heavily against the doorframe. "Mind your own business, Patricia!"

"Dad, I was just concerned," Patricia pouted. "Emily hasn't been seen all morning. Could it be that—"

"Waaah—" Tommy burst into louder sobs at her words. David clenched his younger brother's hand, his little face flushed with suppressed emotion.

Mary Stone hurried over and pulled the boys into her arms. "Shut your mouth, you troublemaker! Spouting nonsense like that!"

Patricia shrank back. She wouldn’t dare argue with her mother-in-law—the slap from last time still stung.

"Grandma, did Mommy really leave us?" David looked up with tear-filled eyes.

"Nonsense!" Mary wiped his face with her handkerchief. "Your mother went to town to pick up a package. She’ll be back soon."

A crowd of villagers had gathered, murmuring among themselves. Someone whispered, "I heard the educated youths are all trying to return to the city..."

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Mary whirled around. "Anyone else spreading rumors will get their lips torn off!"

John cleared his throat loudly. "Everyone, disperse! Get back to work!" He turned to his wife. "Keep an eye on the boys."

Once the crowd had scattered, Mary crouched down and gently patted her grandsons' backs. "Tell Grandma, what did Mommy say before she left?"

"She said... she’d buy us candy..." Tommy sniffled.

Mary’s heart ached. Emily had indeed changed these past few months—but who knew if it was genuine?

In the kitchen, she sighed as she looked at the brand-new towel and toothbrush. These were everyday items for city folk, but rare luxuries in the countryside.

"Grandma, will Mommy really come back?" David suddenly asked.

Mary’s hands stilled. Forcing a smile, she said, "Of course she will. Your mother loves you both dearly."

But she wasn’t so sure herself. Rumors about educated youths returning to the city were growing louder. If Emily really left...

"Here, wash your faces." Mary wrung out the new towel with extra care. "When Mommy comes back, she’ll laugh if she sees two little messes."

The boys obediently tilted their faces up. Sunlight streamed through the window, glinting off their tear-streaked cheeks.

Suddenly remembering something, Mary pulled two fruit candies from her pocket. "Have these for now. Mommy will bring better ones when she returns."

Tommy brightened, eagerly unwrapping his candy and popping it into his mouth. But David clutched his tightly and whispered, "I want to wait and share mine with Mommy."

Outside the gate, a neighbor’s hen clucked as it scurried past. Mary stared down the empty village road, her heart in turmoil.

When would this ordeal ever end?
###Chapter 27: Hands Off My Things

"Let's go to Grandma's house to play with Grace," Emily Johnson said, holding her two sons' hands as they walked out, completely unaware of what was about to happen at home.

"We're here," the oxcart driver called out, and the passengers began disembarking.

"Mrs. Stone, be back by eleven sharp—don't be late," the driver reminded her pointedly.

Emily blinked, then nodded. "Understood. I'll be on time."

She wondered inwardly—had the original owner often kept people waiting?

The small town before her was shockingly primitive. Uneven cobblestone roads, a handful of shuttered shops lining the streets, and a long queue in the distance—likely the Supply & Market.

So this was rural life in the 1970s.

She decided to try her luck at the post office first.

"Any packages for me?" Emily asked at the counter.

The clerk looked up, visibly startled by the fair-skinned, neatly dressed young woman before her. "Name?"

"Emily Johnson."

"There's one package and a letter." The clerk turned to retrieve them.

Emily's heart leapt—her parents had actually sent something!

The package was heavy, filling her basket to the brim. Next, she headed to the Supply & Market to use up her nearly expired ration coupons.

By the time she left, she carried several more bags. Curiosity led her toward the state-run diner.

"Mrs. Stone, what goodies did you buy?" A middle-aged woman suddenly sidled up, reaching to lift the cloth covering Emily's basket.

Emily clamped a firm hand over the woman's wrist. "Auntie, what I bought is none of your business," she said coolly. "And I don't like people touching my things."

The woman withdrew her hand with a huff, rolling her eyes. "Oh, so your parents sent more packages?"

"Yes, they're happy to." Emily lifted her chin.

The retort silenced the other nosy women nearby. Who wouldn't envy this city-educated youth whose family sent parcels so often?

The bumpy ride back made Emily's backside ache. The terrible roads threatened to jostle her bones apart.

"Miss Johnson, this is my stop," a fellow passenger said before leaving.

Emily returned home laden with bags, only to find the gate locked.

"David? Tommy?" she called, but no one answered.

This was troublesome. With no idea where the Stone family's old house was, she couldn't haul all these things there herself.

Just as she fretted, a child ran past.

"Hey, could you go to the old house and tell David and Tommy their mom's back?"

The kid dashed off. Soon, shouts echoed in the distance: "David! Your mom's back with lots of stuff!"

In the old house's courtyard, David immediately dropped his toy. "Grandma, I'm going home!"

Mary Stone peered out from inside. "Slow down—don't trip!"
###Chapter 28: Rumors Spread

"Mrs. Stone, have you heard? The whole village is saying you ran away!" Mrs. Li hurriedly stopped Emily Johnson just as she was about to leave the house.

Emily froze, a package still in her hand. The sunlight cast a glow on her face, making her fair skin appear even paler.

"Ran away? Why would I do that?" She frowned slightly.

"They say you abandoned your two children and went back to the city!" Mrs. Li lowered her voice. "Old Mrs. Wang was shouting about it at the village entrance this morning, claiming you left for town at dawn."

Emily’s heart tightened. She had only gone to pick up a package—how had that turned into abandoning her family?

"Mommy!" David came running out of the house, pulling little Tommy behind him, his small face full of worry. "They said you don’t want us anymore!"

Emily crouched down and pulled both children into her arms. "Nonsense! Why would I ever leave you?"

Standing up, her expression firm, she turned to Mrs. Li. "Could you please watch the boys for me? I need to go to the main house."

The package contained mooncakes and money sent by her parents. Emily quickly opened it and took out two oil-paper-wrapped mooncakes.

"David, take me to Grandma and Grandpa’s house."

Along the way, villagers gathered in small groups, whispering and pointing when they saw her.

"Look, she’s back."
"I always said Emily wasn’t that kind of person..."
"Who knows? Maybe she only returned because the rumors got out..."

Emily ignored them, holding her children’s hands as she walked straight ahead.

At the main house, Mary Stone was hanging laundry. When she saw them, her expression darkened.

"Mother." Emily stepped forward. "These are mooncakes from my parents—for you and Father to try."

Mary took the mooncakes with a cold snort. "Heard you were going back to the city?"

"That’s not true." Emily shook her head. "I just went to town to pick up a package."

"A package that took all morning?" Mary clearly didn’t believe her. "People saw you heading toward the bus station."

Emily’s pulse quickened. She had gone near the station—the post office was there.

"Mother, I wasn’t leaving." She pulled out an envelope. "Look, this is a letter from my parents. They don’t even know I’m married yet."

Mary took the letter skeptically, scanning its contents.

"You... kept this from your own parents?" She looked up, shocked.

Emily gave a bitter smile. "I was young and foolish back then..."

"Mommy!" Tommy suddenly clung to her leg. "Don’t go!"

Emily’s heart ached. She bent down and kissed his cheek. "I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be with you."

Mary watched the scene with a complicated expression before finally sighing. "Fine. Since you’re back, settle down properly. I’ll set the villagers straight."

"Thank you, Mother." Emily exhaled in relief.

On the way back, the setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the ground. Emily held each child’s hand, but her heart felt heavy.

This rumor hadn’t come out of nowhere. Who was behind it?

She recalled the figure she’d bumped into near the post office that morning, and her gaze turned cold.

It seemed someone didn’t want her to live in peace.
###Chapter 29: Wisdom Silences Rumors

"Mommy, you won’t really leave us, will you?" David’s eyes were red as he clutched the hem of my dress with his small hand.

I knelt down and gently wiped his tears. "Silly boy, I’m just going to town to pick up a package. Why would I run away?"

Tommy toddled over, his voice sweet and hesitant. "But Aunt Robert said—"

"Do you really believe anything Aunt Robert says?" I cut him off firmly. "Think about it—have I been making all your favorite meals these past few days?"

Both boys nodded.

"Does that sound like someone who’s planning to leave?"

David suddenly threw himself into my arms, his little shoulders shaking. I rubbed his back, my heart aching, while silently cursing that gossip-mongering sister-in-law a thousand times over.

"Come on, let’s go to Grandma’s."

Along the way, we passed a few villagers who avoided my gaze. I deliberately raised my voice. "Some people just can’t stand to see others happy, always spreading lies. If I find out who’s been filling my children’s heads with nonsense—"

Before I could finish, the busybodies scurried away.

The old house was even more run-down than I remembered. Grace stood timidly by the door, her frail frame like a bean sprout.

"Auntie..." she whispered, though her eyes were fixed on the mooncake in my hand.

"Is Grandma home?"

"In the kitchen."

Mary emerged, her hands still dusted with flour. I handed her the mooncake. "Mom, this was sent from my family. Try it."

The old woman hesitated before accepting the heavy oil-paper package. "This is..."

"I should get going." I turned to leave with the boys, not wanting to linger.

Back home, I crouched to their level. "Tell me the truth—who said I was going to run away?"

David bit his lip. "Aunt Robert. She said... city wives always leave."

My teeth clenched in anger. That woman—I’d let her off too easily last time, and now she was pushing her luck!

"Remember, no matter what anyone says, you come to me first. Understand?"

They nodded solemnly.

By evening, raised voices carried from the old house.

"One mooncake, and she thinks she’s so generous!" Aunt Robert’s shrill tone carried far.

Mary’s voice boomed louder. "Then don’t eat it! She was kind enough to bring it, and all you do is gossip behind her back!"

I smirked and gathered the boys. "Come on, let’s make sweet and sour ribs."

Some mouths were best stuffed with good food. As for the idle chatter... well, time would tell.
###Chapter 30: Bloodstained Journey Home

"None for you!" Mary Stone declared sharply, shooting Patricia a withering glare.

Grace and Jack had already taken their seats at the table, watching eagerly as Mary went to fetch the mooncake. When she emerged carrying a mooncake the size of a dinner plate, the entire family gasped.

"T-that's enormous!" Richard stammered.

Patricia's face twisted with regret, her eyes nearly popping out of her head. But Mary remained unmoved, deftly slicing the mooncake into eight equal portions, each as large as a palm.

"Mom, there's meat inside this mooncake?" Richard exclaimed after taking a bite.

At this, Patricia stormed off, slamming the bedroom door behind her. Richard and his sons devoured their portions without saving even a bite for her.

Meanwhile, Emily Johnson bustled by the stove. The sizzle of pork strips in hot oil filled the kitchen with mouthwatering aromas. David and Tommy perched at the table, eyes glued to the frying pan.

"How about dumplings for dinner?" Emily wiped her brow.

Tommy cheered: "Yes! I want ten!"

But David hesitated. "Mom, can we invite Grandma to join us?"

Emily's hand jerked, nearly dropping the spatula. She couldn't possibly make dumplings from scratch! Frozen ones might fool the children, but never sharp-eyed Mary.

"We'll invite Grandpa and Grandma when Daddy comes home," she quickly deflected.

"Michael! Wake up!" Charles Clark knelt by the hospital bed, weeping uncontrollably. "This is all my fault! If anything happens to you, how could I face Emily?"

Samuel Bright paced anxiously. "Daniel, pull him away! He'll reopen the wound shaking Michael like that!"

Daniel River tugged with all his might, but Charles didn't budge. The ward echoed with Charles' wails, making neighboring patients cover their ears.

"Enough!" Samuel finally snapped. "Let him rest!"

Charles quieted instantly, deflated like a punctured balloon. Daniel sighed. "You always act first and think later. Now Michael took that knife for you. How are we getting home tomorrow?"

Samuel massaged his temples as he delegated tasks. "Daniel, get blood-building tonics. I'll find the doctor. Charles, you watch Michael - one more sound and you're out!"

As they dispersed, peace finally returned to the ward.

But in his unconscious state, Michael Stone wandered through eerie dreams. He saw Emily standing in mist, giving him one cold glance before turning away.

"Emily! Wait!" He chased desperately but couldn't catch up. Her silhouette faded into the white fog.

"Michael! Wake up!" Charles panicked at Michael's murmurs, gripping the bedrail until his nails dug into his palms.

If this delay made Emily give up and return to the city... Charles couldn't bear to finish the thought.
###Chapter 31: Awakening from a Nightmare

Charles Clark shot to his feet, his face turning deathly pale. His hands trembled uncontrollably as he stared at Michael Stone, lying unconscious on the hospital bed.

"Brother Michael... why isn't he waking up?"

Daniel River and Samuel Bright were startled by his reaction. They exchanged a glance before rushing to the bedside.

Samuel's fingers shook as he checked Michael's breathing. Relieved to feel the faint rise and fall of his chest, he exhaled sharply before glaring at Charles.

"What's wrong with you? He's fine!"

Charles clutched his hair, his voice unsteady. "Just now... he kept calling out, 'Emily, don't go...'"

The room fell silent.

All three of them knew—Emily had been talking about returning to the city. Michael had left partly to earn money, partly to avoid the issue.

"The doctor said he just needs rest," Samuel muttered, lowering his voice. "He's exhausted. Let him sleep."

On the bed, Michael's brow furrowed, his lips moving faintly. "Emily... don't leave... don't divorce me..."

Daniel's heart ached. "Should we... do something?"

"Do what?" Samuel scoffed. "Wake him up and tell him Emily isn't leaving?"

Silence settled over them again.

Emily Johnson sat in the courtyard, reading under the dappled sunlight filtering through the trees.

"Miss Emily!" A child peeked over the fence.

"What is it?" She closed her book.

"Someone's waiting for you at the hillside!" The child dashed off before she could respond.

Emily frowned. The hillside? Who would be looking for her?

Glancing at the house where David and Tommy were napping, she decided to ignore it.

On the hillside, Sophia Green paced impatiently.

"Why isn't she coming?" she snapped at Peter Wilson.

Peter licked his lips. "Miss Sophia, about the money—"

"Patience," Sophia sneered. "You'll get your share soon enough."

A dark glint flashed in Peter's eyes. Today, he would finally take revenge for the humiliation Michael had dealt him years ago.

"Just wait a little longer," Sophia hissed through gritted teeth. "She'll come."
###Chapter 32: Emily Sees Through the Scheme

"I'll go check." Sophia Green said with a dark expression.

If Emily didn’t show up, her entire plan would be ruined. She had to make sure Emily left in disgrace—otherwise, she wouldn’t rest easy.

"Hurry up. I ain’t got all day," the man snapped impatiently.

Sophia quickened her pace toward the Stone household, her mind racing. If she could pull this off before Michael returned, everything would fall into place.

But there was no sign of Emily along the way, and Sophia’s frown deepened.

"That kid definitely delivered the message..." she muttered under her breath. "Why wouldn’t she come?"

The Stone family’s front door was shut tight. Suppressing her anger, Sophia forced a fake smile and knocked.

"Who is it?" Emily’s voice called from inside.

The door opened, and Emily’s expression turned cold the moment she saw Sophia.

"Emily, why didn’t you come?" Sophia asked, feigning concern.

"Come where?" Emily played dumb.

Sophia gritted her teeth but kept up the act. "I sent someone to tell you."

"Oh?" Emily pretended to suddenly remember. "If it was important, you could’ve just come here. I’m busy studying for the college entrance exams—I don’t have time to run around."

Inside, two little boys—barefoot and peeking over the windowsill—watched the exchange.

Sophia’s face darkened. This bitch isn’t falling for it!

"It was Samuel who wanted to meet you. He’s going back to the city," Sophia lied again.

"What does that have to do with me?" Emily scoffed.

Sophia nearly bit through her tongue. "But you’ve always wanted to return to the city! Samuel has connections—"

"Who said I wanted to go back?" Emily cut her off. "The countryside is fine. Fresh air, healthy food."

Sophia trembled with rage. Since when did this idiot get so sharp?

She’d have to try another approach. Tonight, she thought viciously. It has to be tonight.
###Chapter 33: The Return-to-City Controversy

Bang!

Sophia Green slammed the door shut, her cheerful expression vanishing instantly. Standing outside the courtyard, she glared through the crack at Emily Johnson’s retreating figure.

"Who does she think she is?" Sophia muttered through gritted teeth. "As if she doesn’t want to go back to the city!"

Inside the yard, Emily knelt in the vegetable patch, sunlight dappling her fair skin through the leaves.

"Mommy..." Little David stood timidly behind her, tiny fingers clutching the hem of her dress.

Emily turned to see both boys staring at her with wide, anxious eyes. Her heart softened.

"What’s wrong?"

"You won’t leave, right?" Tommy asked in his small, trembling voice, tears glistening in his eyes.

Emily froze. They had overheard the conversation.

"Silly boys." She ruffled their hair. "Mommy isn’t going anywhere."

But David suddenly threw himself into her arms, his small body shaking. "Aunt Sophia said... Daddy would break your legs if you tried..."

Emily’s gaze turned icy. How dare she say such things to them?

"Don’t listen to her nonsense." She hugged them tighter. "Daddy loves Mommy. He would never hurt me."

A plan formed in her mind. Sophia needed to be taught a lesson—one that would keep her from spreading rumors ever again.

"Come on, let me show you something special." Emily stood, leading them inside.

From the cupboard, she pulled out an oil-paper package, winking mysteriously. "Guess what this is?"

"Candy?" Tommy’s eyes lit up.

"Even better." She unfolded the wrapping, revealing golden mooncakes. "I saved these just for you."

The boys gasped. They had never seen such fancy treats before.

"Try some." Emily broke the pastry in half, handing each a piece.

Tommy took a big bite and immediately grinned. "So sweet!"

David nibbled a tiny corner before carefully rewrapping his share. "I’ll save mine for Daddy."

Emily’s heart swelled. Even when tempted, he still thought of his father.

"Eat up, sweetheart. We have plenty." She stroked his hair. "When Daddy comes home, we’ll all have some together."

Footsteps suddenly crunched in the yard.

"Emily? Are you home?" called an unfamiliar voice.

Emily frowned. Another visitor today?

At the door stood a young woman with braided hair.

"Who are you?"

"I’m Daisy Wood, the new arrival." The girl smiled shyly. "The captain sent me to tell you—there’s a meeting at the Supply & Market tomorrow."

Emily nodded. "Got it. Thanks."

But Daisy lingered, stepping closer and lowering her voice. "Emily... I heard Sophia’s been telling everyone you plan to abandon your family and return to the city."

Emily’s eyes sharpened.

"What else did she say?"

"That... if Michael found out, he wouldn’t let you go..." Daisy twisted her fingers nervously. "I thought you should know. She’s up to no good."

Emily smirked. Sophia just wouldn’t quit.

"Thank you for telling me." She squeezed Daisy’s hand. "Come by for dinner sometime."

After seeing Daisy off, Emily stood in the yard, glaring toward Sophia’s house.

Did she really think Emily wouldn’t fight back?

"Mommy..." David tugged her sleeve anxiously.

Emily blinked, then smiled warmly. "Let’s practice writing, okay?"

"Really?" Both boys gasped in delight.

"Of course." She led them inside. "We’ll surprise Daddy when he gets home."

Her mind was made up. If Sophia wanted to play dirty, Emily would give her a taste of her own medicine.

That night, after tucking the boys in, Emily sat by the kerosene lamp, a cold smile curling her lips.

"Sophia Green... you’ve asked for this."
###Chapter 34: Undercurrents

Emily Johnson sat by the window, flipping through the pages of her book, occasionally glancing at the two small figures busily working in the yard. The fading sunlight cast a warm glow around them.

Meanwhile, beneath the locust tree at the village entrance, Sophia Green was whispering with Peter Wilson.

"Where's Emily?" Peter kicked a pebble impatiently.

Sophia's eyes darkened with malice. "She didn't come."

"What?" Peter's face twisted in anger. "I waited all this time, and she didn't show?"

Sophia smirked. "If she won't come to you, why not go to her? Michael Stone isn't home—just a defenseless woman and two little brats. What are you afraid of?"

She lowered her voice deliberately. "Or... are you content to always be overshadowed by Michael?"

The words cut deep. Peter clenched his fists, veins bulging.

"Don't you dare provoke me!" He glared at her. "I know exactly what you're after. If we weren't both itching to see Michael humiliated, I wouldn't be playing your game!"

Sophia flinched under his fierce gaze but forced a cold smile. "Think what you want. But I heard... Michael should be back in a couple of days."

She gave him a meaningful look before turning away, her clothes fluttering in the evening breeze like the wings of a black butterfly.

Peter watched her retreat, his eyes burning with danger. The October wind carried a chill, but it did nothing to extinguish the fire of rage in his chest.

At the county hospital, in a quiet ward—

"Michael! You're awake!" Charles Clark nearly knocked over the IV stand in his excitement.

Michael Stone tried to push him away but winced as pain shot through his wound.

"Don't move!" Charles fumbled to steady him, voice thick with guilt. "It's my fault... If you hadn't saved me—"

"Enough." Samuel Bright cut him off with a frown, turning to the bed. "How do you feel?"

Michael's vision was still hazy. He had dreamed of Emily saying, over and over, "I'm going back to the city. I won't wait for you."

The memory made his chest tighten.

"How... long was I out?"

"Almost a full day." Daniel River handed him a glass of water. "You lost a lot of blood. You need rest."

A day? Michael abruptly sat up, yanking the IV line.

"I need to leave."

All three men immediately restrained him. "No!"

"I'm fine." Michael stubbornly struggled, sweat beading on his forehead. "I have to go back."

The room fell silent. They exchanged glances—each remembering the name Michael had called out in his delirium.

Samuel sighed. "Rest tonight. Tomorrow... we'll arrange your discharge first thing in the morning."

Outside, the sky darkened. None of them knew a storm was quietly brewing beneath the calm of dusk.
###Chapter 35: Uninvited Guests Lured by the Aroma

"Keep this up, and I'll call your father to deal with you!" The nurse's threat finally silenced Michael Stone.

Meanwhile, the tempting aroma of meat wafted through the small courtyard of the Stone family home. Emily Johnson lifted the pot lid, and the rich fragrance instantly filled the kitchen. The ribs were perfectly stewed, the meat falling off the bone at the slightest touch. She had added a secret blend of spices from her PennyDeals space, making the dish exceptionally flavorful.

"Mom, it smells so good!" Tommy stood on tiptoe, his eyes fixed longingly on the pot.

As night fell, the mother and her two sons enjoyed their dinner by the dim glow of a kerosene lamp. The tender ribs, potatoes soaked in savory broth, and steaming white rice had the boys licking their lips.

"Meat is the best!" David sighed contentedly.

In this era of scarcity, a meal with meat was a rare luxury. After the pork noodles at noon and the rib feast tonight, both boys' bellies were happily full.

"What would you like for breakfast tomorrow?" Emily asked as she cleared the dishes.

"More pork noodles!" Tommy immediately raised his hand.

"Alright, pork noodles and milk then," Emily agreed readily. Cooking noodles was far easier than waking early to make porridge.

After helping the boys wash up, Emily carried the kerosene lamp to light their way to bed. In their simple room, the two burrowed under the covers but stayed wide-eyed.

"Will you wait for Dad to come home?" Tommy suddenly asked.

Emily paused, meeting their hopeful gazes before answering softly, "Yes."

Closing the door behind her, she exhaled deeply. Returning to her own room with the lamp, she found sleep elusive. Pulling out a textbook from the drawer, she worked through a few problems before lying down.

In the dead of night, faint rustling sounds came from beyond the courtyard wall. Emily's eyes snapped open, her hand slipping under the pillow to grip her stun baton.

A shadowy figure crept over the wall...

With a soft thud, Peter Wilson landed silently. He inhaled greedily, as if he could still catch the lingering scent of meat from earlier. The idle troublemaker, driven by hunger, had sneaked into the Stone family's yard under cover of darkness.

In the shadows, Emily held her breath, tightening her grip on her weapon...
###Chapter 36 Midnight Terror

The night was deep, and moonlight spilled like water across the ground.

Emily Johnson lay in bed, wide awake. Her slender fingers traced the stun gun beside her pillow, her gaze sharp as a blade. The anger from dealing with Patricia Stone still simmered inside her.

"Hmph. If anyone dares to come tonight..." A cold smirk curled her lips.

Peter Wilson crept toward the Stone family's courtyard wall. He had already scouted the place—Michael Stone had gone to town to deliver goods tonight. The thought of Emily's graceful figure made him swallow hard.

"Sweetheart, let big brother take good care of you tonight..." He snickered, skillfully prying open the door latch.

The door creaked open.

Darkness swallowed the room as Peter took two steps inside—then his whole body jerked violently.

"Ahh!" He shrieked, convulsing as if struck by lightning.

Emily pressed the stun gun harder, her voice icy. "Breaking into my house in the dead of night—looking to die?"

Before Peter could react, a flurry of blows rained down on him.

"Stop—stop hitting me!" He cowered, scrambling backward. "Sophia Green sent me!"

Emily paused, her eyes glinting with frost. "Sophia?"

Just then, shouts erupted outside. "Fire! Fire! Hurry!"

Villagers jolted awake, grabbing buckets and rushing out.

Seizing the chaos, Peter yelled, "Emily! Be gentle!"

Her foot slammed onto his chest. "Trying to frame me?"

The villagers burst in—only to find Emily standing tall, her boot planted firmly on a trembling man.

"This thief tried to rob me," she said calmly.

"Lies!" Peter wheezed. "You invited me here!"

Emily scoffed. "You?" She pressed down harder. "My man is a hundred times better-looking than you. Can you get me back to the city?"

The villagers exchanged uneasy glances.

"Emily, this—"

Bathed in moonlight, Emily stood unshaken. She had seen through the scheme from the start.

Tonight's drama was only beginning.
###Chapter 37 Midnight Terror

"My husband taught me some self-defense moves," Emily Johnson said, smoothing her disheveled hair. Her profile looked especially cold under the moonlight. "With a face like mine, it’s easy to attract unwanted attention."

"It’s Peter Wilson, that scoundrel!"

Someone in the crowd recognized the figure curled up on the ground. The villagers immediately understood—no matter how desperate Emily was, she would never stoop to someone like Peter.

Everyone knew she was determined to return to the city. Could Peter help her with that? Ridiculous!

"Mommy!" Little David came running out barefoot, his face full of panic. Emily bent down to pick him up, feeling his small body trembling in her arms.

"Uncles, who is this man?" she asked deliberately, her voice laced with just the right amount of confusion.

The villagers exchanged glances. Since Emily had married into the village, she rarely worked in the fields, so it made sense she wouldn’t recognize everyone.

"It’s Peter Wilson..."

"Go get the village chief!"

Peter tried to crawl away, but Emily stepped on his wrist, making him gasp in pain.

Soon, the women who had heard the commotion gathered in a circle, chattering loudly.

"What’s a man doing at Emily’s house in the middle of the night?"
"Could it be..."
"Pah! As if Emily would ever look at him!"

Emily scoffed. "With his stench and wrinkled face?" She kicked Peter again, her movements sharp and precise.

"Ah—!" His pig-like scream cut through the night.

By the time Chief John Stone arrived, his grandson was already pointing an accusing finger. "Grandpa, he’s a thief!"

"Take Peter away!" Chief John ordered sternly.

Emily stood at the gate with David in her arms, ignoring the curious stares. Only when the crowd dispersed did she gently close the rickety gate behind her.

The moonlight spilled like water, illuminating her slightly trembling fingertips.
###Chapter 38 Midnight Terror

"David, are you hungry?" Emily Johnson whispered as she carried her son into the inner room, carefully lighting the kerosene lamp. The flickering amber glow cast shadows across the walls, illuminating David's pale little face.

"Mom, I wish Dad were home," David murmured, his small fists clenched. His voice trembled slightly. "Then the bad man wouldn’t dare steal from us."

Emily’s heart warmed. Even frightened, he was thinking of protecting her.

"Mom isn’t scared," she said, ruffling his hair. "Go to sleep. I’ll check on Tommy."

When she returned from the next room, David had already curled up under the blankets like a frightened rabbit. With a soft sigh, she blew out the lamp.

Meanwhile, the village headquarters blazed with light.

"My boy! My poor boy!" Margaret Wilson wailed, throwing herself over her unconscious son. "Who did this to him? Who dared hurt my child?"

John Stone Sr., the village chief, stood with a stern expression. "Peter was caught stealing in the middle of the night."

"So what if he took a few things?" Margaret shrieked. "Was it worth nearly killing him?"

"Enough!" John slammed his hand on the table. "At dawn, he goes to the police station!"

Margaret’s cries cut off abruptly, as if someone had grabbed her by the throat.

Back at home, Emily slept fitfully, haunted by nightmares of Peter’s snarling face. She jolted awake to find the sky tinged with the first light of dawn.

Beside her, David slept soundly, his face soft and peaceful in the morning glow. Emily rose quietly, but as she pushed open the door, she froze. Mary Stone stood in the yard, her expression grave.

"Mother..." Emily’s pulse quickened.

Mary hurried over, lowering her voice. "The whole village knows what happened last night."

Emily clenched the hem of her shirt. She wasn’t afraid of Peter—but she worried about how this would affect her children.

"Don’t worry," Mary reassured her, patting her shoulder. "Your father-in-law has handled it."

Suddenly, angry shouts erupted from beyond the gate.

"Emily Johnson! Come out here!" Margaret’s shrill voice pierced the air.

Emily paled, instinctively glancing back at the house. David and Tommy were still asleep—they couldn’t hear this.

She took a deep breath, straightened her spine, and walked toward the gate.

This storm was only beginning.
###Chapter 39: The Fierce Daughter-in-Law

"Mom, you're here so early?" Emily Johnson had just woken up when she saw her mother-in-law standing in the yard, holding a wicker basket.

Mary Stone hurried over, taking Emily's hands and looking her up and down. "Were you frightened last night? That damned Peter Wilson deserves to be locked up!"

Emily shook her head, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "I'm fine, Mom. Don't worry."

Mary studied her daughter-in-law's delicate face, recalling the village gossip. Even after having children, the girl still looked so fresh—no wonder she attracted unwanted attention.

"Should I stay with you tonight?" Mary lowered her voice. "I don't feel easy leaving you alone with two kids."

"Really, it's not necessary," Emily said with a smile. "After last night, I doubt anyone would dare try anything."

Mary sighed. "Your father and the others took Peter to the police station before dawn. His parents were wailing—serves them right! Who raised such a disgraceful son?"

Just then, little Tommy came running out of the house, rubbing his eyes. "Grandma!"

"Oh, my sweet boy!" Mary scooped him up and planted a kiss on his cheek.

Emily turned toward the kitchen. "Mom, why don't you stay for breakfast?"

"No, no, I have to get back and cook for the family." Mary set Tommy down, then suddenly remembered something. "Oh, your door latch is broken. I'll have Robert come fix it."

With that, Mary bustled off, leaving Emily standing alone in the yard. She looked down at her hands, the memory of Peter's scream still echoing in her ears from the blow she'd dealt him the night before.

"Mom, I'm hungry!" David poked his head out from inside.

"Coming right up." Emily snapped out of her thoughts and hurried to the kitchen.

Over at the Stone family home, Elizabeth was feeding the chickens when she saw her mother-in-law return. "Mom, I heard about last night—"

"Absolutely true!" Mary slapped her thigh. "Peter Wilson climbed over the wall to steal, and Emily knocked him flat with one swing!"

Elizabeth's eyes widened. "Really? But Peter's so strong..."

"Would I lie to you?" Mary said proudly. "Tell your husband to go fix Emily's door. That girl has her hands full with two kids on her own."

Before long, Robert arrived at Emily's house with his tools.

"Robert, you're here! Come in and sit." Emily, busy in the kitchen, came out to greet him.

Robert gave a warm smile. "Don't trouble yourself, Emily. I'll check the door first."

The two boys circled their uncle, chattering excitedly. Emily returned to the kitchen, deftly boiling noodles, frying eggs, and slicing some meat she'd bought the day before.

"Robert, have some breakfast first!" Emily brought out a steaming bowl of noodles.

Robert waved his hands. "No need, I'll eat at home—"

"Uncle, Mom's noodles are the best!" Tommy tugged at Robert's sleeve insistently.

Under the expectant gazes of his sister-in-law and nephews, Robert finally sat down. The first bite made his eyes light up—the silky noodles, golden fried eggs, and savory meat strips were better than anything from the Supply & Market!

Emily slipped back into the house and retrieved a box of breadsticks from her space, removing the packaging before placing them on a plate.

"Robert, try these," she said with a smile. "I bought them yesterday. The kids love them."

Robert stared at the delicate breadsticks, puzzled. Since when had his sister-in-law become so generous? She used to hesitate even to share a piece of candy...
###Chapter 40 Midnight Terror

Robert Stone had just put down his chopsticks when Emily Johnson handed him a tin can.

"Big brother, these are cookies sent by my parents. Take them back for Lily and the kids to try."

"I can't possibly accept this..." Robert waved his hands in refusal.

"Uncle, give some to Jack!" little Tommy piped up in his childish voice.

Emily smiled and pressed the tin into his hands. "Don't be polite, Robert. I still have more here."

Robert rubbed his hands awkwardly. "Well... thank you, Emily."

Back at the Stone household, he placed the cookies on the table. "From Emily."

Elizabeth Stone stared at the tin with foreign letters printed on it, stunned. This wasn't cheap—it cost several dollars at the Supply & Market.

Since when had Emily become so generous? Wild berries the day before yesterday, mooncakes yesterday, and now imported cookies today...

A pang of bitterness twisted in her heart. Everyone in the village envied Emily. Her brother-in-law treated her like a treasure, even moving out just for her, refusing to let her do any fieldwork.

"I'm off to work," Robert said hurriedly before leaving.

Elizabeth hid the cookies in the cupboard and followed him out.

Gossip had already spread at the village entrance.

"Did you hear? Peter Wilson was caught stealing from Emily's house last night!"

"He was sent to the police station—must be true!"

"Strange, out of all the houses, why target Emily's?"

"I bet he wasn't after things..."

"Exactly! Emily looks like a fox spirit—half the village's young men wanted to marry her back then. Now that Michael's away..."

"Shh! Keep your voice down! You didn’t see it—Peter was beaten half to death last night!"

"What?!"

The women gasped.

"Don’t forget, Michael was the best fighter in our brigade back in the day. You think Emily hasn’t picked up a trick or two after being with him?"

The group fell silent.

Emily was planning to gather bamboo shoots after breakfast when someone knocked on the gate.

It was a young militiaman from the village, once close to Michael.

"Emily, the police station wants you to come in."

"Mommy..." The two children tugged at her clothes nervously.

"Can I bring the kids?"

"Sure, we’ll take the ox cart."

Emily packed some dry rations into a cloth bag before locking up. The three of them boarded the cart heading to town.

At the clinic, Peter had just woken up when he was interrogated. He didn’t hold out long before naming Sophia Green.

When the officers went to the educated youth quarters to fetch Sophia, her face turned deathly pale. The two groups crossed paths on the road, and Sophia glared at Emily with venom in her eyes.

Last night’s plan had failed at the last moment!

But it didn’t matter... She gritted her teeth. If she denied everything, the police couldn’t pin anything on her. She was about to return to the city anyway. If the Wilsons wanted revenge, they’d go after Emily.

She could already picture the Wilsons storming Emily’s house, accusing her of seducing Peter...

A cold smirk curled at the corner of her lips.
###Chapter 41: The Schemes of Fake Sisterhood

"Isn't that Sophia Green?" someone on the oxcart spotted the familiar figure.

"Sis, Peter Wilson insists it was Sophia who sent him to your house," a young villager whispered.

Sophia instigated Peter to break into her home?

Emily Johnson's heart sank. This wasn't just about theft—it was a targeted attack.

An attempt to ruin her reputation?

Hah. Sophia was the epitome of fake sisterhood—all smiles and pretense of friendship while scheming behind her back.

"Mommy, I've never been to town before," little Tommy said, looking up with wide eyes. Michael Stone rarely took his younger son out.

David, however, had accompanied his father to town a few times.

"Here, have some candy." Emily pulled out a few White Rabbit candies from her cloth bag, handing one to each person on the cart.

"Thanks, sis!"

These candies were impossible to find at the local Supply & Market—even in the county, they required ration coupons.

"Mommy, why aren't you eating?"

"I will."

Emily unwrapped the candy and popped it into her mouth. It had been years since she'd tasted this childhood treat. In her modern life, her mother had always bought imported chocolates for holidays, rarely milk candies.

After finishing the candy, she pulled out two breadsticks from her bag.

The cart driver and the young villager exchanged glances, finally understanding why Peter had targeted Emily's home.

The care packages from Emily's parents were clearly filled with luxuries!

"Here's your milk—drink slowly." Emily unscrewed the thermos lid.

Milk powder?!

Even in the county, this was a rare commodity, let alone in their small town.

"Careful, it's hot..."

The oxcart finally rumbled to a stop outside the town police station.

"Emily Johnson..."

An officer approached as soon as they stepped down.

"We've asked you here today to clarify last night's incident."

John Stone Sr. was already inside and took his grandsons away.

"Just recount what happened truthfully."

They were taking her statement.

The officers couldn't fathom how a woman had managed to beat Peter so badly.

"My husband's away, so I keep a stick by my bed for safety. Yesterday, I picked up a care package from my parents—some food and ration coupons—and bought meat while in town. We had stew for dinner, so it was late when we finished."

"I read for a while before bed and only fell asleep around midnight. Just as I was drifting off, I heard noises in the yard. A woman alone with two kids—of course I panicked."

"......"

Emily calmly explained how she'd beaten Peter into submission with nothing but a stick.

As she finished her statement, she ran into Sophia, who'd just been questioned.

"Sophia, here to process your return application?" Emily asked pointedly.

Sophia wasn't free to leave yet, but Emily and the children were cleared to go.

"Dad, come over for lunch with Mom later. I'll take the kids home first."

John Stone Sr. decided to accompany them. Peter's family wouldn't let this go—they might cause trouble at Emily's place.

"Let's go home."

At the drop-off point, the young villager helped carry the children down.

"Thank you. Once Michael's back, we'll have you over for dinner," Emily said sincerely.
###Chapter 42: Longing for Home

"No need, sis. I didn't really help much," the young villager waved his hands nervously, not daring to accept Third Brother's wife's offer of a meal.

"I'll head to work now," he added quickly before hurrying away.

"Dad..."

John Stone Sr. looked at the mother and her two children, sighing heavily. "If the Wilsons come to cause trouble, send someone to call me."

Was he offering his support?

Emily Johnson felt a warmth in her chest. Was her father-in-law no longer afraid of gossip?

"Got it. Don’t forget to bring Mom for lunch—we still have meat at home."

The older man nodded, deciding to have his wife visit his daughter-in-law more often these days. A young woman like Emily would be no match for that shrew Margaret Wilson.

"Alright."

With that, John Stone Sr. walked away, hands clasped behind his back.

At the hospital, Michael Stone finally convinced Samuel Bright and the others to discharge him.

"Doctor, we really have to go."

The doctor reluctantly signed the discharge papers. "Remember to change the bandages regularly."

"Third Brother, let’s split up," Samuel arranged. "Charles and I will get our things from the inn. Daniel, you take care of Third Brother. We’ll meet at the train station."

The four quickly divided into two groups.

"Third Brother, let’s get the tickets first," Daniel River said, helping Michael onto the bus. "With your condition, we should get sleeper berths."

Though still pale, Michael was eager to get home.

On the bus, Daniel carefully shielded his injured brother. A taxi would’ve been better, but their pockets were empty.

The train station buzzed with noise.

"Third Brother, I got us seats," Daniel wiped his sweat. "I told the conductor to notify us if sleeper berths become available."

Michael leaned back in his seat, watching the scenery flash past outside.

Home was getting closer.

Soon, he’d see Emily.

Would she still be there?

The thought that she might have already returned to the city made his chest tighten.

"Third Brother, drink some malt extract," Samuel handed him an enamel mug. "Charles went out of his way to get hot water."

Michael frowned. "Save it for the kids."

"Third Brother, you need the nutrients," Samuel said slyly. "If Sister-in-law sees how pale you are, she’ll be heartbroken."

Michael’s breath hitched.

What he feared most... was returning to find her gone.

"Third Brother, we’ll be home by tomorrow morning," Samuel said, reading his thoughts.

They’d been away for nearly a month, leaving right after the autumn harvest.

Back in Stone Village, Emily had just stepped out with the boys when Margaret Wilson stormed to her doorstep.

"You little witch, running away so fast!" Margaret kicked the locked gate. "You ruined my son—I’ll tear your face apart!"

The iron lock gleamed coldly under the sun.
###Chapter 43: Unwelcome Visitors

In the bamboo grove, Emily Johnson bent down to gather fallen bamboo husks. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground.

"Mom, look how many I've collected!" Tommy held up a big pile of husks, his little face beaming with pride.

Emily smiled and ruffled his hair. "Great job! I'm going to check the hillside. You two stay here and gather firewood, okay?"

David nodded dutifully. "Be careful, Mom."

Carrying a bamboo basket, Emily headed toward the slope. After making sure no one was around, she quickly retrieved fresh ground cherries, blueberries, and cherry tomatoes from her space, filling the basket to the brim.

"Auntie! Auntie!"

A boy with a small braid came running, panting. "Peter Wilson's mom brought people to your house! They're kicking your door!"

Emily's eyes turned cold. "Kicking my door?"

"Yeah! They look really mean!"

Emily grabbed a handful of fruit and handed it to the boy. "Thanks for telling me."

The boy clutched the treats, eyes shining. "Thank you, Auntie!"

"Mom..." David tugged nervously at her sleeve.

She patted his shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry. If I could handle Peter, do you really think I'm scared of his mother?"

Back at home, Emily washed the fruit for the boys.

"So sweet!" Tommy squinted happily, looking like a content little kitten.

"Don't eat too much. Save room for dinner." Emily chuckled and pinched his cheek.

In the kitchen, the rich aroma of braised pork filled the air. David tended the fire while Tommy played with the fruit, counting them one by one.

"Open the door, you little witch!" A shrill voice suddenly rang out from the yard.

David flinched, dropping the firewood.

"Mom..." Tommy shrank back fearfully.

Emily covered the pot and added a ladle of water. "David, watch the fire. I'll deal with them."

"I'll get Grandma to help!" David said urgently.

She shook her head. "No need. Stay here."

Outside the gate, Margaret Wilson stood with her hands on her hips, spewing curses. Behind her were two burly women, their faces twisted in hostility.

"Wretched woman! How dare you lay a hand on my son!"

Emily yanked the gate open.

Margaret stumbled forward, nearly falling inside.

"Well, if it isn't Mrs. Wilson?" Emily leaned against the doorframe, smirking. "What brings you here so early—putting on a show for me?"

Margaret's face turned purple with rage. "You—you little—!"

"Mrs. Wilson," Emily said coolly, smoothing her sleeves, "your son got what he deserved for stealing. If you'd like to join him at the police station, feel free to make a scene."

The two women behind Margaret instinctively took a step back.

Margaret trembled with fury. "You—you—!"

"Me what?" Emily suddenly snapped, her voice sharp. "Kick my door again, and I'll call the police. Then the whole village can see how the Wilsons raised a thief!"

Stunned by her ferocity, Margaret was momentarily speechless.

"Get out!" Emily slammed the door shut.

Outside, Margaret's face cycled through shades of red and white before she finally slunk away in defeat.

In the kitchen, David and Tommy peeked through the door crack, wide-eyed.

"Mom is amazing..." Tommy whispered.

David nodded vigorously, admiration shining in his eyes.
###Chapter 44: A Failed Confrontation

"Is Michael Stone not home?" Mrs. Wilson stood at the gate with her hands on her hips, her beady eyes glinting with malice. Behind her trailed two scrawny girls—her granddaughters.

Emily Johnson had barely opened the door before a spray of spittle hit her face.

"You little wretch! How dare you lay hands on my son!" Mrs. Wilson shrieked, her grating voice loud enough to carry halfway through the village.

Emily eyed the wrinkled old woman coldly. Dressed in patched-up coarse fabric and worn straw sandals, she looked like a relic from another era.

"Well, isn't this the pot calling the kettle black?" Emily crossed her arms, her voice clear and sharp. "Your son was caught sneaking over our wall in the middle of the night, and you have the nerve to come here making a scene?"

Mrs. Wilson's face turned ashen. Back in her youth, she had stolen from the collective farm—something the older villagers still remembered.

"Lies!" Mrs. Wilson suddenly lunged, claws outstretched.

Emily sidestepped effortlessly.

"Oof!" The old woman stumbled forward and face-planted, her forehead nearly smacking the doorstep.

"Grandma!" The two girls rushed to help, only to be slapped away.

"Useless brats! Couldn’t even catch me!"

Emily took a step back, frowning. The girls were stick-thin, their hair brittle and tangled, with lice visibly crawling through the strands.

A crowd had gathered, murmurs rising among the villagers.

"Is Mrs. Wilson here to pick a fight?"
"Her son got caught stealing, and she still dares to make trouble?"
"Heard Sophia Green was questioned too..."

Mrs. Wilson scrambled up, shooting Emily a venomous glare. "You’ll pay for this, you little witch!"

Emily smirked and slammed the door shut. Through the wood, she could still hear the old woman’s curses and the muffled sobs of the two girls.

This was only the beginning.
###Chapter 45: Who Can't Throw a Tantrum?

Rumors have a way of twisting as they spread.

Emily Johnson eyed the woman before her—a thick-necked, scowling figure—and felt her stomach churn. Margaret Wilson, Peter Wilson's mother, was clearly here to make trouble.

"Mom, don't engage with her," Emily said, shielding David behind her. The little boy clenched his tiny fists, his eyes wide with defiance.

"Spit!" Margaret hocked a glob onto the ground. "You little hussy! Get my son out of jail right now!"

David stomped his foot. "Don’t you dare talk to my mom like that!"

"Oh ho! The brat’s got a mouth on him?" Margaret rolled up her sleeves, ready to lunge.

Just then, hurried footsteps echoed from outside the gate.

"Grandma’s here!" Tommy’s high-pitched voice rang out from behind the gathering crowd.

Mary Stone stormed into the yard, with Grace and Jack trailing behind her like ducklings.

"Margaret Wilson!" Mary bellowed. "Your son got caught stealing, and you have the nerve to cause a scene?"

Seeing the tide turn against her, Margaret plopped onto the ground and wailed, "Oh, heavens above! Bullying a poor widow and her child!"

"Cut the act!" Mary grabbed a fistful of Margaret’s hair and yanked. "Get up and speak like a decent person!"

"Ow—!" Margaret howled. "You useless girls, help me already!"

Two timid girls shuffled forward, only to be blocked by Grace and Jack.

Emily watched the farce coldly. "Mrs. Wilson, your son was caught red-handed breaking into homes. This tantrum won’t change anything."

"Lies!" Margaret thrashed, trying to lunge at Emily. "You’re the one who framed him!"

Mary tightened her grip, making Margaret gasp. "Say one more word, I dare you."

The villagers murmured among themselves:
"Peter stole and still acts entitled?"
"Heard he even tried to hit a kid!"
"Serves him right!"

Realizing she was losing, Margaret suddenly flopped onto the ground. "I can’t go on! The Stone family is bullying me!"

Emily nearly laughed. The dramatic flailing reminded her of the scam artists from her past life.

"If you want to die, do it somewhere else!" Mary kicked her without hesitation. "Don’t dirty my yard!"

Margaret sprang up like a fish out of water, jabbing a finger at Mary. "You’ll regret this!" Then she scurried off, her two nieces scrambling after her.

"Mom, are you okay?" Emily steadied Mary, who was panting from the scuffle.

"Fine!" Mary patted her hand. "That’s how you deal with a shrew!"

David and Tommy clung to their grandmother’s legs. "Grandma’s the best!"

Grace and Jack chimed in, "Aunt Emily, we protected you!"

Warmth spread through Emily’s chest. This family might be poor, but they stood together.

In the distance, Margaret’s fading curses went ignored. The sun dipped low, and the rich scent of stewed meat wafted from the house, making mouths water.

"Come on, let’s eat!" Mary waved them inside, herding the children toward the door.

Emily glanced back at where Margaret had disappeared, her gaze turning icy. This wasn’t over yet.
###Chapter 46: The Brawl Erupts

"Stop it!" Emily Johnson snapped, grabbing Tommy and Grace by the collars of their shirts.

Tommy flailed his tiny fists, desperate to charge forward, while Grace squirmed like a wildcat, ready to pounce. Emily held them firmly, afraid they'd dart straight into the chaos.

Mary Stone and Margaret Wilson were already locked in a vicious tangle. Dust swirled as Mary flipped Margaret onto her back, yanking her hair and slamming her head into the dirt.

"Ow! Damn you—" Margaret howled. "Sarah, help me already!"

The gathered villagers gaped in shock. No one had expected the usually mild-mannered Mary to fight so fiercely.

"Grandma!" The two little girls stomped their feet in frustration, but Emily kept them pinned in place.

"Let go of me!" Margaret thrashed. "Don’t think you’re special just because you’re the captain’s wife—ow!"

Mary struck again, snarling, "My son’s not home, so you think you can bully us? Stealing and hitting—do I look dead to you?"

"Hit her! She hurt Mom!" Tommy bared his teeth.

"Bullied Auntie!" Grace echoed.

Jack stood frozen, wide-eyed. He’d never seen his sister and cousin act so ferocious.

As the fight escalated, John Stone Sr. finally arrived with George Wilson in tow. The onlookers reluctantly dispersed.

George hauled his wailing wife away while John scanned the scene, his gaze lingering briefly on Emily.

"Dad, don’t forget lunch," Emily said cheerfully. "There’s meat stewing."

John sighed. Even after being provoked, his daughter-in-law could still smile.

"Alright."

Once he left, Emily fetched a basin of water and called the children over to wash up.

"Grace, Jack—" Her eyes suddenly lit up. "Oh, my Tommy’s so brave! Take your sister and cousin to wash up. I’ll make you some milk."

Tommy flushed pink and led Grace and Jack to the basin. None of them had ever tasted powdered milk—only malt extract—and the sweet aroma made them swallow hard in anticipation.

"Mom, thank you for today," Emily said sincerely.

Mary smoothed her disheveled hair. "That woman had it coming. Her son got caught stealing—serves her right!"

Emily poured each of them a bowl of milk. Mary started to refuse until Emily added, "Let the kids try something new."

A large plate of wild berries sat on the table, their ruby-red hue irresistible.

"Are these safe?" Mary asked skeptically.

"So sweet!" Grace had already popped one into her mouth.

Jack munched happily while the two little ones stared at their milk bowls, waiting for them to cool.

"Mom, watch them for me. I’ll check the pot." Emily lifted the lid, adding potatoes and water before placing a bowl of rinsed rice in the steamer.

"David, go eat with your siblings in the main room."
###Chapter 47: The Warmth of White Rabbit Candy

"Mom, I want to light the fire," David insisted stubbornly, standing by the stove, his small hands gripping the fire tongs tightly.

His eyes were slightly red, clearly still upset that he hadn’t been able to help earlier.

"Silly boy," Emily Johnson crouched down and gently wiped the soot from his face. "Watching over this pot of meat is already helping me the most."

The flames in the stove flickered, casting a warm glow on David’s determined profile.

In the main room, Grace carefully held an enamel cup.

"Grandma, this powdered milk smells so good!" She took a deep breath, the creamy aroma making her squint with delight.

Mary Stone patted her granddaughter’s head. "This is a rare treat—only city folks can afford it."

Jack had already taken a big gulp, milk clinging to his lips. "It’s even better than sugar water!"

"Slow down," Mary said fondly, watching her two grandchildren. "Your aunt is so good to you."

Emily emerged from the inner room, clutching a handful of White Rabbit candies.

"Here, take these." She crouched and stuffed the candies into the children’s pockets.

Grace felt her bulging pocket and beamed. "Thank you, Auntie!"

Jack wasted no time unwrapping one and popping it into his mouth, his eyes crinkling with sweetness.

Mary watched the scene, her heart swelling with gratitude—and a touch of guilt. Why was her daughter-in-law so generous?

"Emily, we should head back now," Mary said, adjusting her coat, the weight of the candies in her pocket grounding her.

"Mom, don’t forget to come with Dad for dinner," Emily reminded from the doorway. "I made stew."

As evening fell and work ended, Elizabeth Stone brushed the dust off her clothes.

"Mom, are you going to Michael’s place?" she asked, seeing her in-laws heading toward the end of the village.

Patricia Stone pursed her lips. "They’re having meat and didn’t even invite their own grandson..."

"Enough!" Robert Stone shot her a glare. "Hasn’t Emily given the kids enough already?"

Grace tugged at her mother’s sleeve. "Mom, Auntie gave us powdered milk. It was so good."

She pulled out a White Rabbit candy and pressed it into Elizabeth’s hand. "Auntie gave us these. Try one."

Elizabeth stroked her daughter’s hair, warmth spreading through her chest. This sister-in-law, though from the city, knew how to care for children better than anyone.

Meanwhile, in Emily’s kitchen, the rich aroma of stew filled the yard. David diligently added firewood, glancing up now and then at the pot.

"Mom, is the meat almost ready?"

"Just a little longer," Emily lifted the lid, steam billowing out. "We’ll eat when Grandpa and Grandma arrive."

The golden light of the setting sun streamed through the window, painting the humble kitchen in a warm, radiant glow.
###Chapter 48: Undercurrents

Knock, knock, knock—

The moment the rapping sounded, Tommy bounded toward the door, his little face alight with excitement.

"Grandpa and Grandma are here! Mommy made lots of yummy food!"

John Stone Sr. and Mary Stone beamed at their lively grandson, letting him tug them toward the dining area.

"Dad, Mom, dinner’s almost ready," Emily Johnson called out, carrying a steaming pot of rice to the table.

Bowls and chopsticks were already set, alongside a fragrant pot of braised pork with potatoes. Golden cornbread cakes, a recipe Emily had learned from the villagers, lined the edges of the pot.

"My, what a feast!" Mary’s eyes sparkled as she took in the spread.

John Sr. swallowed hard—the rich aroma of the stew was even more tempting than he’d imagined.

"Try the pork, Dad, Mom. It’s so tender," Emily urged warmly.

The five of them gathered around the table, digging in with cheerful chatter.

"Mmm, this meat is perfectly seasoned." John Sr. picked a piece of well-marbled pork—it melted in his mouth, earning an approving nod.

"Mom, have some more." Emily served Mary a generous portion. "The kids are still too young for too much meat—it’ll upset their stomachs."

Before Mary could reply, David had already dutifully placed meat on both grandparents’ plates. "Grandpa, Grandma, eat up!"

The pot held at least three pounds of pork and potatoes. The cornbread, dipped in the savory broth, proved even more popular than plain rice.

After the satisfying meal, Mary began clearing the dishes. Emily moved to help, but John Sr. stopped her.

"Emily, let your mother handle this. I need to talk to you."

Puzzled, she sat back down.

"This Peter Wilson business isn’t over," John Sr. murmured. "His mother made a scene today—she’ll be back tomorrow or the next day. With Michael away, your mother will stay with you for a few days."

Emily opened her mouth to protest, but John Sr. pressed on. "The Wilsons have too many brothers. Who knows what they’ll try next? And that Sophia Green..."

At the mention of Sophia, his expression darkened.

"Peter confessed she put him up to stealing from you. Weren’t you two close?"

Emily’s chest tightened. She hadn’t realized Sophia hated her enough to conspire with Peter.

"We had a falling out," Emily admitted bitterly. "But I never thought she’d go this far."

John Sr. sighed. He’d seen his share of dirty schemes over the years, but for Emily’s reputation, this had to be treated as simple theft.

"Stay alert these next few days," he warned. "With Michael gone, you’ll need to watch your back."

Emily nodded, but unease prickled through her. Something told her this wasn’t the end.
###Chapter 49: The Only Way Out

Captain John Stone sighed heavily. "She'll probably return to the city soon."

The number of educated youths in the village had dwindled. Many had left during the first college entrance exams, and now another group had departed.

"She mentioned it before."

When the topic shifted to Peter Wilson, Captain John frowned in thought. "We can only charge him with burglary. What do you think?"

If Michael hadn’t taught Emily some self-defense moves, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

Emily understood how crucial reputation was in these times.

"Dad, Peter was just there to steal," she said calmly, without a trace of resentment toward her father-in-law for not taking stronger action.

Captain John insisted that Mary stay with them for a few days.

"Then let Mom come over for dinner."

"No need. You’re not working now, and the rations from the village are barely enough for you and the boys."

His daughter-in-law had already used up their meat to host them today. As parents, they weren’t the type to take advantage.

After Mary finished cleaning the kitchen, the elderly couple headed home.

"Did you talk to Emily?"

"Yes, she agreed. She even invited you for dinner tonight."

Mary waved her hand dismissively. "We have food at home, no need to trouble her." Then she muttered, "Michael’s been gone for half a month now. Who knows when he’ll return?"

Captain John was also concerned. With Michael around, the Wilsons wouldn’t dare cause trouble.

"He’s not alone—Charles and Samuel are with him. I heard many places have loosened restrictions now."

That was why he had agreed to let them go and see the situation outside.

Now, no one monitored poultry farming, the militia had disbanded, and the educated youths had returned to the cities.

Rumors said some had started leasing land, though he didn’t know if it was true.

Meanwhile, Michael Stone was on a train, lost in thought.

"Michael, time to eat."

He had no appetite, his mind filled with thoughts of his wife.

"You go ahead, I—"

"You have to eat. Everyone’s lost weight on this trip, and you’ve lost the most."

It wasn’t surprising coming from Samuel, but even Charles agreed.

Charles still carried guilt. If not for saving him, Michael wouldn’t have gotten hurt.

Under their concerned gazes, Michael finally picked up his chopsticks.

Seeing him eat, the group relaxed.

At the Wilson household.

"Old man, are you just going to let our son go to jail?" Margaret Wilson lay in bed, grinding her teeth.

She would never let her son be imprisoned.

The only way out was to make Emily retract her statement.

But after today’s confrontation, the girl hadn’t budged.

And that damned captain...

When George Wilson remained silent, Margaret exploded. "If you don’t do something, I’ll make your life hell! Peter’s an honest man—he’d never steal!"

George was a man of few words.

With a domineering wife, he rarely spoke up.

But though Margaret seemed to rule the household, it was George who made the decisions—she was just the one who voiced them.

"Was Peter there to steal," George finally said, "or to do something unspeakable to Emily? Don’t pretend you don’t know."
###Chapter 50: No Way Out

"How could my Peter possibly be stealing?" Mrs. Wilson slammed the table, her voice shrill enough to pierce eardrums. "He was obviously going after that vixen!"

Mr. Wilson crouched gloomily on the doorstep, rapping his pipe against the threshold with sharp cracks. "Keep your voice down! You want the whole village to know our son was caught harassing a woman?"

Mrs. Wilson paled, her words dying in her throat like a strangled hen. It dawned on her—an indecency charge was far worse than petty theft.

"Then... what do we do?" Tears plopped down her cheeks. "If Peter goes to prison, his life is over!"

Mr. Wilson took a harsh drag of his pipe. "Captain Stone himself hauled him in. It's too late now."

"It's all that little tramp's fault!" Mrs. Wilson gnashed her teeth. "If she hadn't lured my Peter—"

"Shut your mouth!" Mr. Wilson shot to his feet. "You think Michael Stone is deaf? If that madman finds out, he’ll break Peter’s legs!"

At the mention of Michael, Mrs. Wilson shuddered. The man was ruthless—he’d once taken down a wild boar single-handedly.

"But... he’s not home right now..."

"Not home?" Mr. Wilson sneered. "He’ll be back eventually. Right now, Peter’s safer in jail."

Mrs. Wilson’s eyes suddenly widened. "Wait—last time Peter got beaten by Michael, was it because of that girl too?"

Mr. Wilson didn’t answer, but his expression darkened further.

"George, you have to do something!" Mrs. Wilson stamped her foot in desperation. "If Peter goes to prison, our family’s reputation is ruined!"

"What can I do?" He clawed at his hair in frustration. "Emily refuses to drop the charges, and Captain Stone won’t let it go."

Mrs. Wilson’s eyes darted. "What if... I beg Emily?"

"Beg?" Mr. Wilson scoffed. "With what?"

"I—I’ll send Sarah!" She suddenly screeched, "Useless girl, get in here!"

A thin figure shuffled in timidly. "G-Grandma...?"

"Go!" Mrs. Wilson yanked her granddaughter’s arm. "Go to the educated youth quarters and see if Sophia’s back. Then beg Emily to let your uncle go!"

The girl trembled. "B-But..."

"But what?" Mrs. Wilson glared. "You’ll kneel and kowtow if you have to! Just bring her back!"

The girl hung her head, tears welling. She remembered that night—how Emily had shielded her and her sister with fierce determination.

"Move it!" Mrs. Wilson kicked the girl’s leg. "Worthless brat!"

Stumbling out the door, the girl finally let her tears fall. She knew—this was an impossible task.
###Chapter 51: Emily Johnson Isn't to Be Trifled With

"Get moving! Standing here waiting to die? If you don't get this done, none of you will eat tonight!"

Margaret Wilson stood with hands on hips, berating her two granddaughters.

In this era of favoring sons over daughters, rural girls had it especially hard. The Wilson sisters had been treated as burdens since birth—so much so that no one bothered giving them proper names, simply calling them Sarah and Emma.

"Grandma, I'll go right now..." Sarah trembled, her voice barely a whisper. She knew all too well how much her grandmother's cane could hurt.

"Sis, are we really going to see Emily Johnson?" Emma tugged at her sister's sleeve, eyes wide with fear. The morning's spectacle was still fresh in their minds—if Emily had dared to strike their uncle, what chance did they have?

"Not going would be worse..." Sarah gave a bitter smile. At least Emily wouldn't hit them, but their grandmother's cane was guaranteed pain. As for their parents? Their eyes were only for their brother.

The sisters went to the educated youth quarters first but found no one there. Steeling themselves, they headed toward the Stone residence, each step feeling like walking on knives.

Meanwhile, at the Stone household, David and Tommy were napping. Emily sat at the table, engrossed in her exam papers when a knock at the door made her pen pause mid-stroke.

"Who is it?" She opened the door cautiously, frowning when she saw the Wilson sisters. Her eyes darted around, wary of an ambush.

"Miss Johnson, please... let my uncle go..." Sarah kept her head down, voice shaking. This city-educated girl before her had skin so fair it nearly glowed, clothes without a single patch—she might as well have been from another world.

Emily smirked coldly. "He's already at the police station. Begging me won't help. Wrongdoers deserve punishment."

"Please..." Sarah suddenly dropped to her knees, startling Emily into stepping back.

"You could kneel till nightfall and it wouldn't change a thing," Emily's voice was ice. "I don't play these games. Kneel if you want—I can take it."

With that, she slammed the door shut, blocking out the nosy villagers outside. What scene hadn't she weathered before? Gossip meant nothing to her.

Outside, the sisters were stunned. They hadn't expected Emily to be so unyielding—even kneeling hadn't worked.

"That old hag Margaret Wilson thinks sending her granddaughters to kneel will make Emily back down? Dream on!"

"Emily's heart is truly cold..."

"Pah! When Peter Wilson was stealing chickens left and right, who complained then? Didn't that family whose chicken went missing curse for three days straight?"

The murmurs rose and fell, all audible to Emily inside. She curled her lips slightly and returned to her exam papers. This farce wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 52: A Mother's Protection

"That Emily Johnson is downright cruel!" A woman in the crowd had barely finished her shrill accusation when Mary Stone's sharp glare silenced her. The woman shrank back and quickly disappeared into the throng.

"I think Emily did the right thing!"

"But those poor girls kneeling there—it's just not right..."

"I'll go get the captain's wife!"

It was Robert Stone's cousin who spoke, hurrying off toward the Stone family home.

Mary was in the yard, airing out quilts, when she heard the news. The bamboo pole in her hands clattered to the ground.

"Grace, watch your brother!" Mary grabbed a broom and stormed out.

Grace took little Jack's hand, her eyes bright. "Grandma, we're coming too!" She remembered the delicious cookies at Aunt Emily's house.

By the time Mary arrived, two thin figures knelt at Emily's doorstep, surrounded by a crowd of nosy women.

"Disgraceful!" Mary yanked the girls to their feet. "That old hag Margaret Wilson is too cowardly to come herself, so she sends her granddaughters to kneel here? If you don't leave now, I'll march straight to the police station and report the Wilsons for harassing a soldier's family again—let’s see if Peter gets extra jail time for that!"

The threat sent Sarah Wilson trembling. She knew her grandmother’s temper all too well—if they caused Uncle Peter’s sentence to be extended, they’d be beaten half to death when they got home.

"We're leaving!" Sarah grabbed her sister’s hand and bolted, terrified Mary would make good on her threat.

The onlookers scattered like startled birds under Mary’s glare.

The gate creaked open.

"Mom, I’ve caused you trouble again." Emily sighed. When it came to unreasonable people, someone like Mary was the only solution.

"You’re just too soft-hearted." Mary patted her hand.

"Aunt Emily!" Grace chirped, her eyes darting toward the house.

Emily smiled knowingly. "Come in, I’ll get you some cookies."

Mary followed her inside, lowering her voice. "As long as Peter’s sentence isn’t finalized, Margaret won’t stop. She has three sons and two daughters—Peter’s the youngest."

As Emily handed out cookies, Mary continued, "The eldest branch has two girls and a boy. The third branch has two sons still in school. The daughters married far away—heard the bride prices were steep, two hundred for one, a hundred for the other..."

Just then, David and Tommy stirred in the next room. Emily peeked in to see them sleeping soundly, their cheeks rosy and fuller than when they’d first arrived.

"Here, try some wild berries." Emily brought out a plate of foraged treats. Jack immediately grabbed a tomato, juice dripping down his chin.

Mary frowned. "Margaret dotes on that youngest son of hers. She’ll keep making trouble. You need to be prepared—"

Before she could finish, a commotion erupted in the distance. Emily’s heart sank—had the Wilsons come back?
###Chapter 53: The Youngest Son, Grandma's Favorite

"Five children?" Emily Johnson frowned slightly.

Peter Wilson was the youngest son in his family.

The youngest had always been Grandma's favorite.

No wonder Margaret Wilson dared to cause trouble at their doorstep.

"When Michael was home, they wouldn't even dare to step near our door," Mary Stone scoffed.

That much was true.

"Mom, has David's father mentioned when he'll be back?" Emily asked softly.

Mary was caught off guard.

How would she know when her third son would return?

"By the way," Mary quickly changed the subject, "now every household in the brigade can raise more chickens."

"Mom, I heard some places have already started implementing land contracts," Emily said, her eyes lighting up. "I wonder when our brigade will follow suit?"

"What contracts?" Mary looked confused.

"It means distributing land to each household to farm themselves," Emily explained. "They buy their own fertilizer, choose their own seeds, and pay the agricultural tax. That way, it's easy to see who's lazy and who's hardworking."

Mary hesitated.

Her daughter-in-law rarely left the house—where did she hear such things?

"I read it in the newspaper," Emily said, noticing her doubt. "Several brigades have already started pilot programs, and their yields have increased instead of dropping. When it's their own land, who wouldn't take good care of it?"

Mary felt a spark of excitement.

"Your father hasn't mentioned this."

"Next time Dad goes to town, he should look for the newspapers," Emily said confidently.

Though she was a '90s kid, she had heard stories from her grandparents about that era.

The two younger children quickly finished the plate of fruit.

David and Tommy rubbed their eyes as they came out of the room.

Seeing Grace and Jack, they immediately perked up.

"I still have canned fruit in my room," Emily said with a smile. "David, go to the kitchen and bring a big bowl and some chopsticks."

"Canned fruit!" The children's eyes lit up.

Mary, however, was secretly shocked.

Was her daughter-in-law planning to finish all the gifts from her parents?

David ran to fetch the bowl and chopsticks.

Emily went back to her room and brought out a large jar of mixed fruit—coconut jelly, golden peaches, and oranges, all gleaming temptingly.

The children obediently gathered around the table.

Emily expertly flipped the jar upside down and gave it a light tap.

With a pop, the lid came off easily.

The sweet fruit tumbled into the big bowl.

"Mom, you should try some too," Emily invited. "This kind of canned fruit is really popular where I'm from."

Jack, being small, knelt on the bench.

His eyes fixed eagerly on the fruit in the bowl, swallowing hard.

The white coconut jelly, golden oranges, and peaches—just looking at them made mouths water.

"You should eat too," Mary said to Emily.

The 900-gram can was divided among six people and quickly emptied.

Even the syrup was slurped up by the children without a drop left.

"Your parents sent these things—we should save some," Mary couldn't help but remind her.

Emily agreed with a smile.

But in her mind, she was already planning to buy more supplies.

Mary left soon after, taking Grace and Jack with her.

If she stayed any longer, who knew what other treasures her daughter-in-law might bring out?

"Do you want to go play with your friends?" Emily asked her sons.

It was still early—she couldn't keep them cooped up at home all day.

"Mom, I want to stay with you," David said, clinging to her.
###Chapter 54: The Missing Brat

"Mommy, can I stay with you?" David looked up with sparkling eyes.

Emily Johnson set down her pen and ruffled his hair. "Do you know how to write yet?"

"I do!" David puffed out his chest proudly. "I can count too!"

Not to be outdone, little Tommy chimed in, "Me too!" He began counting on his fingers, "One, two, three... twenty!"

Emily couldn't help but laugh. "Tommy, you still only know up to twenty?"

Seeing neither child wanted to play outside, Emily had an idea. "David, how about I give you a special mission?"

"Yes!" David immediately stood at attention, his small face serious like a little soldier.

"Teach your brother to count from one to fifty. Can you do that?"

"Mission accepted!" David declared loudly, grabbing Tommy's hand as they scampered off.

Watching their earnest little figures, Emily smiled warmly before returning to her exam papers. The afternoon faded into evening.

After reheating leftovers for dinner and bathing the boys, Grandma Mary arrived.

"Mother, you're here," Emily greeted her.

Grandma Mary beamed at her grandsons in their new clothes. "I'll sleep with the boys tonight."

The night grew still—except for the train, where chaos erupted.

"My grandson is gone!" A shrill scream pierced the quiet.

Samuel Bright and the others jolted awake to find the grandmother of the unruly child from earlier wailing. The boy had spent the day kicking seatbacks, nearly injuring the still-recovering Michael Stone.

"Serves them right," someone muttered.

The carriage erupted into commotion. Some went to alert the conductor, while others watched coldly—the pair had made plenty of enemies that day.

"Michael..." Samuel turned to his friend.

Michael frowned. "Help search."

"But that brat—"

"Find him first," Michael cut in. "Could be kidnappers."

The three split up, combing every corner of the carriage—but the child was nowhere to be found.

"Same age as David, but not half as well-behaved," Daniel River sighed.

Dawn was breaking when they finally located the boy—drugged and barely conscious. Only then did the grandmother remember to thank them, bowing repeatedly.

"Where was this gratitude earlier?" Charles Clark scoffed. "Spoiling a child ruins them. Now you know regret."


###Chapter 55: Emily's Heartwarming Scheme

"It's still early. We'll need to sleep through another night before getting home," Michael Stone sighed, unconsciously rubbing the bandage on his wound.

After two days and nights on the train, they'd only covered half the distance.

"Does it still hurt, Michael?" Charles Clark asked with guilt in his voice. If not for rushing home, Michael would still be recovering properly in the hospital.

"Should we change the dressing?" Charles added hastily before Michael could respond.

"No need. Get some rest."

The train compartment finally quieted down, leaving only the rhythmic clatter of wheels against tracks.

———

Emily Johnson thought herself an early riser, but when she opened the door, she found her mother-in-law had already swept the courtyard clean.

"Mother Mary, you're up so early?"

As Mary Stone was about to leave, Emily cut in: "Have breakfast here. I'll make it right away." She hurried toward the kitchen before her mother-in-law could refuse.

Noodles would be quickest. She fried four eggs for the four of them.

"I can eat at home..." Mary followed her into the kitchen.

"Mother, stay and eat here," Emily insisted firmly, continuing her preparations. Mary had no choice but to help stoke the fire, watching her daughter-in-law skillfully fry eggs and boil noodles.

"My parents sent plenty of food and money. Michael also stocked up on fine grains before leaving," Emily said while cooking. "These noodles look white, but they've actually gone slightly moldy. We should finish them quickly."

Moldy? Mary sniffed suspiciously.

"I didn't seal the bag properly. They got damp," Emily continued smoothly without batting an eye. "You don't mind, do you?"

Having lived through famine years, Mary wouldn't fuss over such things. "Of course not."

After the noodles were ready, Emily woke the two little ones. David and Tommy ate with relish, but Mary grew increasingly puzzled—where was this supposed moldy taste?

Looking at the snow-white noodles and golden fried eggs in her bowl, Mary understood perfectly. This wasn't about spoiled food—it was her daughter-in-law's clever way of ensuring she ate well.

"It's getting late. I should head back," Mary said, putting down her bowl. "If the Wilsons come making trouble, call for me."

"Understood, Mother." Emily obediently saw her mother-in-law out.

Returning inside at just seven o'clock, Emily clapped her hands. "Come, let me teach you the Three Character Classic."

"Yay!" The two boys gathered around excitedly.

"Men at their birth..."

"Are naturally good..."

Their childish voices echoed through the morning courtyard.

Meanwhile at the main Stone household, Elizabeth Stone was cooking sweet potato porridge in the kitchen.

"Grandma's back!" Lily exclaimed upon seeing Mary enter, showing no surprise.

Grace bounded over. "Grandma, breakfast is almost ready!" These past two days following Grandma to Aunt Emily's had brought many treats. Last night when their parents gave them biscuits, they'd proudly boasted about all the delicious things they'd eaten at Aunt Emily's.
###Chapter 56: The Family Division Storm

"Mother, you're back!" Robert Stone staggered into the yard carrying two buckets of water. Spotting Mary Stone returning from outside, he quickly set down the carrying pole. "Elizabeth is already working in the kitchen."

Patricia Stone came back from the river with a basin of laundry. Seeing her mother-in-law walking from the direction of the third son's house, her eyes narrowed. "Mother, didn't Emily invite you to stay for breakfast?"

Mary frowned, her dislike for her second daughter-in-law growing. This woman was always stirring up trouble—worse than Emily had ever been!

"Emily is very thoughtful," Mary said loudly, deliberately raising her voice. "She made me white noodles this morning, even poached an egg in them. Delicious!"

The yard fell silent. Patricia's eyes widened, and she nearly dropped her laundry basin.

Noodles? Eggs?
Since when had Emily become so generous?

Little George, hearing the word "noodles," immediately clung to his mother's leg. "Mom, I want noodles too!"

Patricia shoved him away irritably. "Go ask your aunt for some!"

"No!" Little George shrank back. "Aunt Emily hits people!"

Mary snorted. "Those noodles were sent by Emily's mother. Want some? Tell your mother to take you to your own grandmother's house!"

Patricia's face turned livid. She smacked Little George's bottom. "Always greedy! Always greedy!"

The boy burst into loud wails.

From the main house, John Stone Sr.'s voice rang out. "William, when Michael gets back, we're dividing the family property."

William Stone's hoe clattered to the ground. "Father, what did you say?"

Patricia froze. Dividing the family? That meant she'd have to do all the laundry, cooking, and fieldwork herself from now on!

"Pick your own homestead land," John said firmly.

In the kitchen, Lucy tiptoed to share the news with Lily and Elizabeth. The three exchanged smiles, their eyes gleaming.

###Chapter 57: The Noodle That Divided a Family

Elizabeth Stone had long contemplated dividing the household. As the eldest daughter-in-law, she knew her in-laws would inevitably live with her branch of the family. But the thought of finally separating from the insufferable second branch—always flaunting their status—filled her with satisfaction.

"Always going on about being the 'Stone family's great contributors' just because they have two sons," Elizabeth muttered with a sneer. The third branch might be stubborn, but at least they never bragged about their children. Compared to the second branch's arrogance, they were far less irritating.

William Stone crouched by the threshold, sighing heavily. He never imagined a simple bowl of noodles would lead to talk of splitting the family.

"Father really wants us to move out?" he asked his wife, wringing his hands.

Patricia Stone slammed her spatula against the wok. "Fine by me! From now on, we keep our own earnings." But the moment she remembered she’d no longer get to enjoy the third branch’s meat dishes, her enthusiasm waned.

Mary Stone was airing quilts in the yard when Grace tugged at her sleeve, little Jack in tow. "Grandma, can we go play with David?"

"Go ahead," Mary said, squinting against the sunlight. "But if anyone from the Wilson family comes by, call for me immediately."

She hadn’t forgotten how Emily Johnson used to behave. The woman seemed reasonable now, but who knew when she might revert to her old ways?

"Aunt Emily! Aunt Emily!" Grace called out before even reaching the door.

David dashed to open it like a gust of wind, and soon the four children were chattering and laughing in a lively huddle.

Emily peeked out from inside. "Come in and play." She retrieved her treasured breadsticks and gave each child two.

"Thank you, Aunt Emily!" Grace beamed, while Jack echoed her in his tiny voice.

Once the children raced off to play, Emily locked the gate again. The test papers on her desk remained spread out, and she rubbed her tired eyes.

"Mom’s so much nicer now," David told Grace as they ran. "She even teaches us to read!"

Other children gathered around, eyeing their snacks enviously. David generously shared small pieces, and soon a game of hide-and-seek erupted in the threshing yard.

Inside, Emily graded the papers, frowning at the results. The humanities scores were disappointing, and even the science answers showed muddled knowledge. She chewed on her pencil, troubled. "Should I choose humanities or sciences?"

The sound of laughter drifted through the window, and suddenly she remembered—she had chosen humanities in her past life too. The thought settled her nerves, and she bent over the papers again, determined to finish.
###Chapter 58: Behind Bars

The October morning carried a chill as Emily Johnson sat at her desk flipping through a high school physics textbook. With eight months left until the college entrance exams, she mapped out her study plan.

"Literature, math, and English first," she murmured to herself. "Then practice tests. My science foundation is still there—I can rebuild it."

Her fingers traced the yellowed pages, determination flashing in her eyes. Though her past-life knowledge was hazy, eight months would be enough to regain mastery.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted in the Wilson household.

"Peter loves steamed buns best," Mrs. Wilson sniffled, wrapping freshly steamed buns in a blue cloth bundle. "I must take these to him."

In the police station interrogation room, Peter Wilson cowered in a corner, his body aching. The memory of Emily's ruthless glare that night still made him tremble.

"Mom!" He clung to her like a lifeline. "That witch framed me!"

Mrs. Wilson shoved a bun into his hands, heartbroken. "Oh, my boy. When I get home, I'll skin that little bitch alive!"

Peter wolfed down the food, venom in his eyes. "Make her pay, Mom!"

"Peter," Mr. Wilson finally spoke, his voice low. "Stick to your story—say Sophia Green put you up to it."

"I did!" Peter gnashed his teeth. "The cops don’t believe me!"

Footsteps approached. A stern-faced officer entered. "The verdict for Peter Wilson’s burglary case is today. Will you attend?"

"Yes! Of course!" Mr. Wilson nodded frantically.

In the next room, Sophia Green was pale with shock. She never expected Peter to turn on her.

"I never told him to do it!" she sobbed to the officers. "He’s lying!"

At noon, under harsh sunlight, the verdict was read aloud.

"Peter Wilson is found guilty of burglary. Sentenced to one year in prison."

"What?!" Mrs. Wilson shrieked, collapsing to the floor. "My son is innocent!"

Mr. Wilson turned ashen, bracing himself against the wall. A whole year—Peter would spend the New Year behind bars!

Sophia exhaled in relief, slipping away unnoticed amid the Wilsons' uproar. She hurried back to the village, eager to escape the fallout.

News spread like wildfire by afternoon.

"Did you hear? Peter got a year!"
"Emily went too far..."
"Serves him right! Who told him to steal?"

Mrs. Wilson took to her bed, ill. Her daughters-in-law seized the chance to demand separate households. The once-domineering matriarch now lay moaning, her spirit broken.

Meanwhile, Emily remained focused on her physics problems. The village gossip meant nothing to her.

"Since when do thieves get sympathy?" She smirked, her pen scratching sharply across the page.
###Chapter 59: Gossip Stirs Anger

David and Tommy ran home with reddened eyes, tear stains still wet on their little faces.

"What happened?" Emily Johnson set aside her work and immediately crouched down to check on them.

Grace stood nearby, holding little Jack's hand, and explained in a hushed voice, "Aunt Emily, the village kids said you're mean. They said you sent Peter Wilson to jail."

Emily chuckled softly and wiped the boys' tears. "Silly boys, crying over something like this isn't worth it."

She pulled them into a gentle hug. "Think about it—if Peter hadn't stolen from us, would he have been arrested?"

"No," David sniffled.

"Exactly. Actions have consequences." She ruffled their hair. "Didn't you say you wanted to be brave little men?"

"We are brave!" Tommy puffed out his chest, though his voice still wobbled.

"Then brave men don't cry over nonsense."

Once the boys had calmed down, Emily stood and headed to the kitchen. "Come on, I'll make you some warm milk."

The four children sipped from their cups, small smiles finally returning to their faces.

"How about sweet potato cakes for lunch?"

"Yes!" they chorused.

Grace hesitated before asking, "Aunt Emily... can I stay and eat too?"

"Of course." Emily nodded warmly. "Let's eat early then."

In the kitchen, Emily swiftly washed, sliced, and steamed the sweet potatoes. The rich, sugary aroma soon filled the air.

She remembered her father teaching her how to make sweet potato cakes—back when her pregnant mother had craved them, and he'd gone out of his way to learn the recipe.

When the first batch came out, golden and fragrant, the children could hardly wait.

"Let them cool first," Emily reminded them.

While they waited in the main room, she quietly took out yeast, mixed it with flour and a splash of milk, and began preparing steamed sponge cake.

"Mom, hurry!" David called.

"Coming!" She wiped her hands and poured each child another cup of milk.

They ate eagerly, crumbs dotting their cheeks. Grace and Jack practically closed their eyes in delight with each bite.

After seeing Grace and Jack off, Emily found Mary Stone busy by the stove.

"Grandma, Aunt Emily gave us sweet potato cakes and milk," Grace reported.

Mary frowned. "Did someone in the village say something bad about your aunt?"

Grace nodded. "They said she's mean for sending Peter to jail."

"Nonsense!" Mary smacked the counter in frustration. "Those busybodies have too much time on their hands! Since when is a thief the victim?"

The more she thought about it, the angrier she grew. These gossips would scream bloody murder if they lost so much as an egg—yet here they were, defending a thief.
###Chapter 60: It's All Her Fault

"What's this? Trying to plead for Peter Wilson now?" Mary Stone scoffed. "They’ve already said every excuse in the book!"

Grace blinked innocently. "Grandma, Aunt Emily said those who do wrong should be punished."

Mary nodded approvingly. "And punished they should be. Go keep an eye on the Wilsons—see if they cause any trouble for your aunt."

"On it!" Grace dashed off without another word. She’d gotten plenty of treats from her aunt—this was the least she could do.

In the kitchen, little Jack stared longingly at the stove.

"Remember," Mary whispered sternly, "not a word to your uncles about the food your aunt gives you."

Jack nodded solemnly. He hadn’t forgotten how Richard had snatched his candy last time—that bully even hit David and Tommy.

Before long, Grace came panting back. "Grandma, Peter’s mother is sick with anger!"

A cold smile curled Mary’s lips. "Good. Now go play."

When the Stone family returned from work and sat down for dinner, Patricia muttered under her breath, "People are saying Emily’s too ruthless..."

Smack! Mary slammed her chopsticks on the table. "Ruthless? Should she have waited for Peter to empty her house? Sounds like you’ve had too much to eat—skip dinner tonight!"

Patricia’s eyes widened. Over one little comment?

"Apologize!" William yanked his wife’s sleeve urgently. After a morning’s work, his stomach was growling.

Grudgingly, Patricia mumbled, "I’m sorry, Ma... Emily’s raising two kids alone, it’s not easy..."

"Enough!" John Stone Sr. barked.

Patricia shrank back, silenced. Her full bowl of rice was promptly halved by her mother-in-law. She didn’t dare resent the elders—so she directed her fury at Emily instead.

This is all Emily’s fault! If she hadn’t gone to fetch that package, would there have been a thief?

Still, Peter’s one-year sentence had scared off the other troublemakers in the village. That woman really had the guts to send someone to jail!

Meanwhile, Emily was busy in the kitchen. The sweet aroma of steamed cake wafted through the air as she sprinkled raisins into the batter.

"Mommy, are you still cooking?" Tommy peeked in from the doorway. Had she not eaten enough because Grace and the others came over?

"I’m making sweet potato cake."

When the cake emerged from the steamer, both boys’ eyes sparkled.

"Want a taste?" Emily broke off a small piece.

"So good!"
"Delicious!"

Emily tried a bite herself. Not bad—still got the touch.

"Take some to Grandpa and Grandma," she reminded them. "It won’t keep long."

###Chapter 61: An Unexpected Visitor

Emily Johnson wrapped a large piece of freshly steamed sweet potato cake in old newspaper and handed it to the two little boys.

"David, take your brother to deliver this to Grandma."

Tommy pouted, his small hands clutching the hem of his shirt. "Mommy, I don’t want to share with Richard." The memory of being bullied last time was still fresh in his mind.

Emily crouched down and ruffled Tommy’s hair. "Don’t worry, Grandma will handle it."

The two little figures skipped off toward the old house.

"Grandma!"
"Mommy made sweet potato cake!"

Mary Stone took the still-warm cake, its sweet aroma filling the air.

Tommy looked up at her with bright eyes. "Grandma, can we not give any to Richard?"

Mary’s heart softened. She knew Richard was spoiled and often picked on the other children.

"Alright, I promise."

Before heading out to work, Mary quickly divided the cake into portions.

"Grandma, I want the biggest piece!" Richard pointed greedily at the largest slice.

Mary frowned. "This is your family’s share. Take it or leave it."

Richard glared at Lily’s portion. "Why does she get so much?"

"Because her family is bigger. Keep complaining, and I’ll take it back."

John Stone Sr. examined the golden raisins in the cake and remarked in surprise, "Michael’s wife is really generous."

"Indeed," Mary said, breaking off a small piece to taste. "She even added sugar and powdered milk."

"Powdered milk?" John’s eyebrows shot up.

"She made me a cup of milk with it the other day," Mary said casually.

John frowned. "But she’s always been desperate to return to the city. Why the sudden change?"

"Homesickness is natural," Mary cut him off. "Don’t assume the worst of her."

In the eldest son’s house, the children devoured their portions with delight.

"Mom, this is even better than the ones from the Supply & Market!" Grace licked her fingers.

Elizabeth Stone exchanged a glance with her husband. The change in Michael’s wife was too strange.

"Remember, don’t ask for anything when you visit Aunt Emily’s," Elizabeth warned sternly.

Grace lowered her head. "But she’s the one who offers..."

Emily was curled up on the kang, reading, when a knock interrupted her.

"Who is it?" she asked impatiently.

No answer.

Cautiously, she pulled the door open, squinting against the sunlight.

Standing outside was a haggard-looking Sophia Green.

"Emily..." Sophia’s voice trembled.

Emily regarded her coldly. "What do you want?"

Sophia’s heart sank. It was true—she believed the rumors.
###Chapter 62: Fake Sisterhood

"Emily, you have to believe me!" Sophia Green clutched Emily Johnson's sleeve desperately, her eyes red-rimmed. "I had no idea Peter Wilson was coming to steal from you."

Emily took a subtle half-step back, her gaze icy.

Fake sisterhood? How amusing.

The memory of Peter's sneaking figure that night flashed through her mind. If he had succeeded... A shiver ran down her spine, cold sweat dampening her back.

"Sophia," she said softly, each word sharp as a blade, "Peter confessed it was you who sent him."

"That's a lie!" Sophia jerked her head up, panic flickering in her eyes. "He—he's trying to drive us apart!"

Emily let out a light laugh, leisurely smoothing her sleeve. "It's true Peter has a grudge against Michael Stone, but why would he involve you to pass the message?"

Sophia paled.

"I remember that day," Emily suddenly stepped closer, "first, a child came to call me outside, but I refused. Not long after, you showed up at my door."

Sophia stumbled back, hitting the doorframe.

"What a coincidence," Emily's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Don't you think?"

Sophia clenched her fists. When had this fool become so sharp? Before, a few sweet words would have been enough to manipulate her.

"Emily, let me explain—"

"Explain what?" Emily cut her off. "How you conspired with Peter to ruin me?"

Footsteps sounded outside the courtyard. Sophia's face twisted, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Keep your voice down!"

But Emily deliberately raised her volume. "Sophia, I treated you like a sister, and this is how you repay me?"

"You're insane!" Sophia lunged to cover Emily's mouth.

Emily dodged nimbly, catching a glimpse of a figure outside the gate.

The show had begun.

"I'm insane?" She scoffed. "You're the one who'd stoop so low for a chance to return to the city!"

Sophia trembled, a flash of venom in her eyes. "Emily Johnson, don't push me!"

"Push you?" Emily suddenly pulled a letter from her sleeve. "Then what do you call this—your letter to Peter?"

Sophia froze, staring at the letter as if struck by lightning.

The gate creaked open.

Emily leaned in, whispering in Sophia's ear, "What do you think will happen when John Stone Sr. finds out?"

Sophia's legs gave way, and she collapsed to her knees.
###Chapter 63: Fake Sisterhood

"Emily, I came to see you."

Sophia Green's sickly sweet voice came from outside the door. Emily Johnson's hand paused on the doorknob. She took a deep breath, a cold smirk curling her lips.

This woman only ever came when she wanted something.

"What do you want?" Emily opened the door, her tone icy.

Sophia plastered on a smile, but her eyes darted past Emily into the room. "I heard your parents sent you another package? We're such good friends—"

"Good friends?" Emily cut her off, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Is that what you call setting me up?"

Sophia's face paled. "What are you talking about?"

"Peter Wilson. Did you think I wouldn't find out?" Emily took a step forward. "If I hadn't been careful, you would've forced me back to the city by now, wouldn't you?"

Sophia stumbled back half a step, forcing a laugh. "Emily, you've got it all wrong—"

"Wrong?" Emily scoffed. "Then why are you here? To take more of my things?"

Caught in her lie, Sophia's face twisted between rage and humiliation.

"Get out." Emily spat the word cleanly. "If I see you again, don't expect me to be polite."

The door slammed shut with a resounding bang.

Outside, Sophia stood frozen, her nails digging into her palms. She glared at the closed door, venom flashing in her eyes.

"Emily Johnson, just you wait!"

Inside, Emily leaned against the door, her chest heaving. She wasn't the original owner of this body—she wouldn't let this so-called "good friend" manipulate her anymore.

"Mommy?" Little David rubbed his eyes as he shuffled out from the inner room.

Emily's expression softened instantly. "Why are you awake?"

"I heard shouting..." David said timidly.

"It's nothing." Emily ruffled his hair. "Mommy was just chasing away a bad person."

David nodded, though he didn't fully understand. Then he suddenly added, "Was it that lady who always takes our food?"

Emily blinked in surprise. "How did you know?"

"Every time she comes, she leaves with lots of yummy things." David pouted. "Daddy said those were from Grandpa and Grandma for you..."

Warmth flooded Emily's chest as she pulled her son into a hug.

"Not anymore," she whispered. "Mommy won't let anyone bully us again."

Meanwhile, back at the dormitory...

"Well, well. Came back empty-handed?" Samuel Bright leaned against the doorframe, smirking at Sophia.

Sophia shot him a venomous glare. "None of your business!"

"Not mine, no." Samuel shrugged. "But a word of advice—the Wilsons aren't people to cross. Once that old woman recovers—"

"Shut up!" Sophia shrieked, cutting him off, her face deathly white.

She stormed into her room and slammed the door behind her.

Inside, her hands trembled as she pulled a letter from beneath her pillow. The return approval she'd been waiting for still hadn't come. She couldn't wait any longer.

"Emily... you brought this on yourself." Her eyes burned with madness as she stared at the paper.

The night wind rustled the curtains, moonlight casting eerie shadows across her twisted face—like a vengeful ghost.
###Chapter 64: No Reason to Bow

Emily Johnson stood coldly in the yard, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her clothes. She could hear Sophia Green and Olivia Brown talking inside the house but didn’t even bother to glance their way.

"Maybe... you should go smooth things over?" Olivia whispered.

"Why should I?" Sophia slammed her enamel cup down with a loud clang. "What does Emily Johnson have besides her pretty face that’s worth my effort?"

Outside the courtyard wall, Emily’s lips curled into a cold smile. She turned and walked to the kitchen, efficiently starting dinner preparations. The sharp clatter of the spatula against the pan sounded almost deliberate, as if she were venting something.

"Mom..." David stood timidly at the doorway.

Emily paused, the frost in her expression instantly melting. "Take your brother to play for a while. I’ll call you when dinner’s ready."

At dinner, the two boys ate eagerly, their mouths shiny with oil. The tender shrimp balls burst with savory juices in their mouths, but they obediently didn’t ask why the "sweet potato cakes" tasted especially good today.

Meanwhile, at the Stone family’s old house, Mary Stone sighed as she stared at the empty bed. The mess with the Wilson family wasn’t resolved yet, and she couldn’t bring herself to stay at her youngest son’s place again.

The train rattled through the night.

Michael Stone closed his eyes, feigning sleep, when a sharp cry jolted him awake.

"Help! I don’t know him!"

At the other end of the carriage, a girl with braided hair clung desperately to her seat, one side of her face swollen. A rough-faced man yanked her arm, spewing obscenities.

"My wife’s trying to run away! Mind your own business!"

The passengers around them exchanged uneasy glances, some already withdrawing their hands from offering help.

Michael’s expression darkened. The scene inexplicably reminded him of Emily’s cold back as he left.

"Charles," he said hoarsely, "get the conductor."

Charles Clark hesitated for a second before rushing toward the other end of the carriage.

"Is she really your wife?" Michael spoke up, his voice quiet but cutting through the tension in the carriage.

The man’s eyes darted nervously. "O-of course! Our kid’s old enough to run errands!"

The girl, pinned to her seat, suddenly lifted her head, tears brimming with desperation. "Please help me, sir! I was kidnapped!"

Michael’s fingers absently traced the edge of his ticket. Three days ago, he’d demanded the same from Emily—whether she planned to abandon him and their sons to return to the city. What had her expression been then?

"The conductor’s here!" Charles pushed through the crowd with two uniformed men.

The man’s face twisted in panic. He let go of the girl and tried to bolt. Michael stretched out his leg—thud—sending the man sprawling face-first onto the floor.

"Sort this out," Michael said to the conductors with a nod. When he sat back down, he realized his palms were damp with sweat.

Samuel Bright leaned in and whispered, "Michael, about Emily—"

"Shut it." Michael turned to the pitch-black window. His reflection showed the tense line of his jaw.

The train whistle pierced the night, sounding eerily like something inside him cracking apart.
###Chapter 65: A Life Saved

"Michael, look!" Charles Clark whispered urgently, subtly gesturing toward the far end of the train car.

Samuel Bright followed his gaze and saw a man in a plaid shirt gripping the wrist of a young woman. She appeared to be in her early twenties, her face pale, her hair tied in two braids.

"Something's wrong," Michael Stone murmured, narrowing his eyes.

The man raised his voice. "Stop making a scene, wife! Let's go home!"

The girl shook her head desperately. "I don’t know you! Help!"

Passengers murmured among themselves, but no one intervened.

"Michael, I'll get help!" Charles jumped to his feet.

Michael held him back. "Wait."

His sharp eyes scanned the man’s rough hands and the girl’s delicate wrist. A suspicion formed in his mind.

"Charles, find the train police. Samuel, block the other exit. Daniel, with me."

They moved swiftly. Michael strode toward the struggling pair.

"Sir, may I see your marriage certificate?" His calm voice silenced the entire car.

The man stiffened. "None of your business!"

"I’m with the police," Michael lied smoothly. "We’re cracking down on human trafficking. Cooperate."

Sweat beaded on the man’s forehead, and his grip loosened.

Just then, Charles returned with the train police, while Samuel cut off the other exit.

"Take them both!" the officer ordered.

After three hours of interrogation, the truth emerged. The girl was a university student from the provincial capital, while the man was a repeat offender who preyed on young women traveling alone.

That evening, the girl returned to the train car, her eyes red.

"Thank you," she said, bowing deeply to Michael. "If not for you, I might have been—"

Michael waved it off. "Just doing what anyone would."

"To you, it was nothing. To me, you saved my life." Her voice trembled. "I’m Lin Xiaoyu, from Provincial Normal University. If you ever need anything—"

"Your stop," Michael interrupted gently. "Take care."

As the girl disappeared into the crowd, Daniel sighed. "Michael, you really did save a life today."

Michael stared out the window at the darkening sky, silent. His thoughts drifted to his wife’s worried gaze before he left. He longed to return home.

Meanwhile, back in the village, Emily Johnson suddenly sneezed.

"Mom, are you sick?" David asked anxiously.

Tommy rushed to pour hot water. "Drink this, Mom!"

Emily rubbed her temples, her heart inexplicably racing. She glanced toward the village entrance, a strange foreboding settling over her.


###Chapter 66: Mom's Secret Snack Box

Mom hadn't left the house in three days.

"Brother, my tummy's growling," Tommy said, rubbing his flat stomach while staring longingly toward the kitchen.

David tiptoed to retrieve the powdered milk can from the cupboard. "I'll make you some milk. Let's not disturb Mom yet."

The two little figures bustled around the kitchen. David skillfully lit the fire while Tommy handed him sticks of kindling. Once the water boiled, they carefully prepared two bowls of milk.

"Mom, are you awake?" David gently knocked on the bedroom door, his voice laced with concern.

Emily Johnson jolted awake from her dream, staring blankly at the unfamiliar ceiling for a few seconds before reality set in. "I'm coming, sweetheart," she called out hurriedly.

When she opened the door, the two boys stood waiting with hopeful eyes.

"Sorry I overslept," Emily crouched down to pat their heads. "I'll make breakfast now."

"No need, Mom," David pointed to the two bowls on the table. "We made milk. And there's still the sponge cake you bought..."

Emily's heart warmed. She stepped into the kitchen and noticed the lingering warmth in the stove—they'd managed to light it themselves.

She quickly boiled six eggs and retrieved soft bread from her PennyDeals stash. "Eat these first. Later, I'll leave some snacks in your room for when you're hungry."

While David dutifully cleared the dishes, Emily returned to her room and secretly opened PennyDeals. Her fingers flew across the screen: sandwich cookies, sweet potato chips, honey cakes... When she spotted the cherries, she couldn't help but swallow hard.

"Remember, snacks aren't meals," Emily said as she arranged the treats in a small wooden box. "Too many will stunt your growth."

Though David didn't quite understand the connection between snacks and height, he trusted his mother's words.

"Eat these twisted pastries first," Emily instructed before washing the basket of gleaming red cherries.

"Come try these wild berries," she called to the boys.

Tommy picked one up curiously. "Mom, they're so pretty!"

Soon, the three of them sat around the table, happily stuffed.

"Mom, let's practice writing," David suddenly suggested. "You should go read and rest."

Emily froze. While other village children played outside, why did hers prefer staying indoors?

###Chapter 67: Turbulent Homecoming
"Michael, just one more turn and we're there!" Charles Clark rubbed his hands excitedly, his sun-darkened face alight with anticipation. He patted the bulging pocket of his coat, where he kept all the money he'd earned on this trip. With this, he could finally marry Daisy in style.

Michael Stone gazed out the window at the familiar fields, his Adam's apple bobbing slightly. It had been a month—had Emily grown taller? Had David and Tommy been eating well? His fingers brushed against the hidden pocket on his chest, where the candies he'd bought for the children were tucked away.

"Finally home," Daniel River said with a stretch, his honest face breaking into a wide grin.

Only Samuel Bright remained tight-lipped, his brows furrowed so deeply they could crush a fly. The night before they left, he'd heard his sister-in-law throwing things in the house, screaming hysterically about going back to the city. What if she was already gone when they returned?

"Next stop: XXXX..."

The announcement cut through Samuel's thoughts. The four men stood in unison, jostling toward the exit with the crowd.

"Michael, should we grab a bite first or head straight for the next bus?" Charles asked, lugging two heavy suitcases, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

Michael checked his watch. "We'll eat when we reach town." His voice was hoarse, and the wound on his left arm still throbbed faintly.

Samuel reached out to steady him, but Michael subtly sidestepped the gesture. Straightening his back, he strode ahead with purpose. The other three exchanged glances before hurrying after him.

After two bus transfers, they arrived in town by mid-afternoon. Starving, the four men rushed into a noodle shop and devoured three large bowls between them.

"Isn't that Michael Stone?" Muttered whispers drifted in from outside.

"Word is his wife—"

"Peter Wilson's family is in for it..."

Fragments of conversation reached their table. Charles scratched his head. "Michael, why are they staring at us?"

Samuel's chopsticks clattered onto the table. Daniel quickly smoothed things over. "We've been gone so long—people are just curious!"

But the further they walked toward the village, the more pointed the stares became. Samuel's heart hammered in his throat. He stole a glance at Michael, whose jaw was clenched tight, his strides growing faster.

Under the old locust tree at the village entrance, a group of women sat cracking sunflower seeds. At the sight of them, the chatter abruptly died. One bold woman called out, "Michael, your wife—"

Michael froze, his gaze sharp as a blade. The woman swallowed the rest of her words.

"Move," Michael ground out through his teeth, hauling his luggage forward. The three men exchanged uneasy looks but followed.

The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the dusty village road. In the distance, the Stone family's small courtyard was just coming into view.
###Chapter 68: Who's the Real Hero?

The courtyard gate remained shut. Whether Emily Johnson was home would be revealed with a knock.

Samuel Bright took a deep breath and raised his hand to knock. What must come would come.

Inside, Emily frowned at the sound. "David and Tommy are back already?" she murmured. But the children had just left—they couldn't have returned so soon.

Besides, her boys would've called "Mommy" by now.

The silence outside confirmed these weren't her children. "Sophia Green again?" Her chest tightened. The woman had visited just yesterday. At this hour, all the villagers should be working in the fields.

"Who is it?" she called out.

Outside, several men exhaled in relief at the familiar voice. She hadn't left. She was still here.

The door opened. Emily's heart skipped a beat at the unfamiliar faces. "Who are you?" She forced calm into her voice.

The four men froze. Had their sister-in-law/Emily really forgotten them after just a month?

Emily's palms grew damp. Could the male lead be among them? The protagonist had indeed been away for ages.

This was bad. Her question might expose her.

Samuel's eyes twinkled as he smoothed things over. "Sis, don't pretend you don't recognize us just because we're late. We came back the moment our business wrapped up."

Daniel River and Charles Clark relaxed. So their sister-in-law was just upset with Michael.

"Sis, it's my fault," the lanky man said guiltily. "If I hadn't been careless, Michael wouldn't have gotten hurt. Then he could've returned sooner."

Emily's tension eased slightly. These two probably weren't the male lead.

"Come inside." She stepped aside.

The remaining two bore some resemblance. Which one was the protagonist? Her pulse raced.

"Thanks, sis." They filed in.

"Would you like some water?"

"We'd appreciate that."

She turned to prepare sugar water—the standard hospitality offering.

Michael noticed his wife avoiding his gaze. Still angry?

During this trip, he'd witnessed the bustle of big cities. No wonder she wanted to return. If she insisted on leaving, he'd take David and Tommy with her. They'd find work to support the family somehow.

Emily sensed an intense stare. Turning, she met deep-set eyes.

Buzz cut, sharp brows beneath a strong forehead. This had to be the male lead.

Truly handsome men looked good even with military haircuts.

"Sis, we should head out," Samuel stood.

"After days on the train, we reek."

"Sis, I'll take off too."

The three bid farewell in turn. Only the man who'd been watching her remained.

"Safe travels..." She mechanically saw them out, her heart pounding like a drum.
###Chapter 69: Blank Memory

Emily watched them leave before quickly turning back inside. Michael had returned unexpectedly, and she needed to dispose of anything that shouldn’t be there.

Her fingers trembled slightly. At least she had already destroyed the packaging.

But how could she explain her earlier coldness?

Amnesia.

It was the only excuse.

"Who are you?" She feigned confusion as she looked at Michael.

Pain flickered in his eyes. "Emily, I came back too late."

He hurried to grab the gifts he’d brought, hoping to cheer her up.

"I really don’t know you." Emily took half a step back.

Michael’s chest tightened. Was she determined to pretend not to recognize him?

"I promised to take you back to the city. We’ll go together as a family. This time, I’ve earned enough money."

Emily remained indifferent.

"A few days ago, I woke up and couldn’t remember anything. David told me I hadn’t left the house for two days—maybe the fever damaged my memory."

Two days?

Fever-induced amnesia?

Michael felt as if he’d been struck by lightning. While he was away, she had endured a high fever alone—and lost her memories.

Guilt washed over him. He had been so focused on earning money that he never imagined something like this could happen.

"Emily, this is all my fault. Let’s see a doctor—right now!" He stepped forward urgently.

Emily pressed a hand against his chest. "I’m fine. Your friend said you were injured? Is it serious? Do you need rest?"

She was still concerned about him.

Warmth spread through Michael’s heart. Even if she didn’t remember, as long as she was here, it was enough.

"Not serious. I don’t need rest."

Emily turned toward the house. "Wait here."

She quickly stuffed her phone, power bank, test papers, and forbidden books deep into the wardrobe. Then she pulled out a pack of beef jerky from the drawer—her late-night study snack.

"My parents sent it. Try some."

Beef jerky? From her parents?

Michael frowned inwardly. Over the past two years, her family had sent fewer and fewer packages. He had often secretly added items to them. This jerky… didn’t seem like something they would send.

"You eat it."

"Just try it. It’s really good." Emily didn’t dare say more, afraid of slipping up. "A few days ago, the neighbor’s wife took me to town. That’s when I found out my parents often send money and food. This time, I actually received a package and a money order."

Michael was even more surprised. They really sent money?

"They’ve always cared about you the most."

Emily smiled bitterly inside. If her original parents had truly loved their daughter, they wouldn’t have sent her to the countryside in the first place.
###Chapter 70: You Failed Twice

Emily Johnson sat on the edge of the kang, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her clothes. Snow drifted outside the window, but the room was stiflingly warm.

Michael Stone brought over a steaming bowl of brown sugar water and carefully placed it in front of her.

"Drink something warm," he said in a low voice.

Emily stared at the swirling liquid in the bowl, her thoughts drifting far away. The original character—this supporting female—had such a privileged family background.

Her father was a workshop director, her mother an accountant at the factory. Her eldest brother was a team leader in the mechanical workshop, and his wife worked at the textile mill. Her second brother had married the daughter of a chef at a state-run restaurant. Her eldest sister was a primary school teacher, and her brother-in-law worked in long-distance transportation.

With a family like this, how could they send their youngest daughter to the countryside?

"Do my parents... know I'm already married?" she suddenly looked up.

Michael's gaze flickered. "They... don't know."

Emily's heart sank. Just as she thought.

The original character had hidden her marriage to return to the city, only to be hastily married off by her family. Those so-called relatives were just afraid of the shame of having a divorced daughter.

She clenched her fists.

This era was so unfair to divorced women. A divorced man might get a few remarks, but a divorced woman would be gossiped about for the rest of her life.

"Emily?" Michael called softly when he noticed her distraction.

She snapped back to reality. "I want to take the college entrance exam."

Michael frowned slightly. "But you..."

"I'll pass this time," she said firmly. "Once I return with an admission letter, let's see who dares to talk behind my back."

Michael was silent for a moment. He remembered that after his wife married him, she had never mentioned going back to her family. But after the college entrance exams were reinstated, she suddenly insisted on returning to the city...

"Alright," he finally nodded. "I'll go to town and buy you study materials."

"You're not taking the exam?" Emily was surprised.

Michael smiled bitterly. "I wasn't good at school back then. Besides, someone has to earn money to support the family."

Emily looked at his rough hands and suddenly felt a pang of guilt.

Outside, the snow fell heavier.
###Chapter 71: An Unexpected Reunion

"Mom, Mom!" The voices of David and Tommy grew louder as they ran closer, panting. "We heard Dad is back?"

Before Emily Johnson could respond, the two boys burst into the yard. David pushed open the door, his small face alight with anticipation. When he spotted the familiar figure in the living room, his eyes instantly brightened.

"Dad!" David dashed forward like a little cannonball.

"Dad!" Tommy followed close behind, stumbling as he ran.

Michael Stone's gaze softened as he looked at his sons. "David, Tommy." He crouched down and pulled them into a tight embrace.

"Dad, I missed you so much!" David clung to his father's neck.

"Me too!" Tommy buried his face in Michael's shoulder.

Before they could say more, both boys suddenly burst into tears. Michael froze, unsure how to react. "Big boys don't cry, especially not in front of Mom."

The two immediately sniffled and wiped their faces with grubby hands, turning into little messes in seconds.

"I wasn't crying!" David hiccuped.

"Me neither!" Tommy insisted.

Emily watched their teary eyes and couldn't help but smile. "That's right. Our David and Tommy are the bravest."

Just then, Grace and Jack timidly stepped into the yard. "Uncle..." Grace called softly.

Michael looked up at his brother's children. "Grace, Jack." He noticed his own sons were dressed in new clothes, their cheeks rounder and their skin fairer. No wonder they felt heavier when he hugged them.

"These clothes..." Michael glanced at Emily, puzzled.

"New ones," Emily replied simply. She knew the original host was terrible at sewing, and Michael was well aware of that.

"They look nice," Michael nodded, though his expression remained thoughtful.

"David, go get the bowls. I'll make you some milk," Emily instructed.

Milk? Michael frowned. That wasn't easy to come by in town.

David immediately wriggled out of his father's arms and happily ran to the kitchen. Emily took out an enamel cup, expertly pouring water and adding powdered milk. Soon, the rich aroma filled the room.

Michael's eyes followed his wife's movements. Where had she gotten milk powder? Even the Supply & Market in the county rarely stocked it.

"Traded for it," Emily said, as if reading his mind. "I'll explain later."

She poured small portions into each child's bowl, then handed the remaining milk to Michael. "Drink some. It'll help you recover."

Michael was stunned. His wife was actually showing concern for him? Before he left, they'd had a huge fight about returning to the city.

The children had already climbed onto the bench, kneeling as they sipped carefully. Clearly, this wasn't their first time drinking milk.

What surprised Michael even more was that his wife had also served his brother's children. Milk powder was precious—most people wouldn't share it with others.

"Uncle," Grace said, holding her bowl with shining eyes, "Auntie made sweet potato cakes yesterday, and they were so good!"

"And the milk is delicious!" Jack licked his lips contentedly.

After finishing their milk, the two reluctantly said goodbye before leaving. Michael watched them go, his confusion deepening. What exactly had happened at home while he was away?
###Chapter 72: The Hero's Feelings

"Last time I went to town to pick up the package, I saw someone urgently selling this can of milk powder," Emily Johnson explained softly, her fingers unconsciously tracing the lid. "David and Tommy are too thin. I thought they could use the extra nutrition."

Milk powder was a rare luxury in these times. Even malt extract, which city children often drank, was something their family could only afford every few months. Let alone this far more precious milk powder.

"I bought two cans—enough for the whole family," Michael Stone said as he carried his luggage into the house.

Emily followed him inside and watched as he began unpacking his bag.

"This is a cashmere coat for you. Red suits you." He unfolded an exquisitely tailored coat. "And these two lipsticks—a soft pink for everyday wear and a bold red to brighten your complexion."

Emily's heart fluttered slightly as she took in the items spread across the bed. Loose powder, vanishing cream, scented soap, shampoo, and even a pair of finely crafted leather boots. Each item was expensive, especially the cashmere coat, which must have cost at least a hundred yuan.

She had to admit, the man had good taste. The soft pink lipstick was fresh and natural, while the bold red was striking. Even the skincare products were mid-to-high-end for the era.

"Thank you," she murmured. "But you shouldn’t spend so much in the future."

She could afford these things herself. Still, since her transmigration, this was the first time someone had put so much thought into selecting gifts for her. The realization stirred something unfamiliar in her chest, but she quickly suppressed it.

The hero was meant for the heroine, after all. And she? She was just a side character destined to exit the stage.

"These are for the kids." Michael pulled out two sets of children's clothes.

Emily glanced at the nearly emptied bag and couldn’t help but ask, "What about you?"

"I got something too." He grinned, showing off his purchases—two shirts, two pairs of trousers, and a pair of leather shoes.

Just as the two boys were happily carrying their new clothes back to their room, Mary Stone’s voice called from outside the courtyard.

"Michael! Michael, are you back?"

"Mother’s here," Michael said, turning to leave.

Emily suddenly caught his arm and handed him a bar of scented soap. "Give this to her. Tell her you bought it especially for her."

Michael paused. He remembered how resentful his wife had been before he left, still upset over his mother’s favoritism toward boys. Why the change now?

It seemed a lot had happened in the past month.

"Alright." He took the soap and stepped outside.

"Mother."

Mary’s eyes welled up the moment she saw her son. "You’ve lost weight!"

"Mother, this is for you—some scented soap."

"Such an expensive thing… You should keep it for yourselves—"

"Emily insisted you have it," Michael said quietly.

Mary froze at his words.
###Chapter 73: Who Gave You the Nerve?

"Then I'll accept it," Mary Stone said, taking the gift.

Michael Stone frowned slightly, puzzled.

Why did Mom refuse when I offered it, but took it the moment Emily was mentioned?

They sat down in the living room, and Mary sighed, bringing up recent events.

"A few days ago, Peter Wilson broke into our house to steal. Your wife beat him so badly he passed out from the pain. Your father took him to the police station, and with the current crackdown on crime, he got sentenced to a year in prison."

"What?" Michael shot to his feet, his fists clenched so tight his knuckles cracked.

Peter Wilson had the audacity to rob his home while he was away?

"Your father kept it from you because he was afraid you'd go after Peter for revenge," Mary said in a hushed tone. "You have a family now. If you act recklessly and something happens, what will Emily and the children do?"

Michael took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down.

She was right. He wasn't alone anymore.

"I understand, Mom."

"Your wife is fierce," Mary continued. "She dislocated Peter's arm, and he fainted from the pain. She even keeps a wooden stick in her room now."

A faint smirk tugged at Michael's lips.

Serves him right.

"Oh, and Emily went to town the other day to pick up a package from her parents. They sent quite a few nice things."

"Her parents really care about her," Michael said, his tone softening.

Mary nodded, then brought up another matter. "Your father wants to divide the family property. Earlier, Richard bullied David and Tommy, and Patricia even got into a fight with Emily. Your brother William disciplined Richard, but your father thinks it's time for the family to split."

"Divide the property?" Michael's eyes turned cold. "Richard bullied my sons? And Patricia came looking for a fight?"

Perfect. I was only gone for a few days, and suddenly everyone thinks they can walk all over us.

Mary quickly added, "I'm just letting you know. Don't make a scene."

After seeing his mother out, Michael went to the children's room.

"David, tell me the truth. Does Richard bully you often?"

The brothers exchanged a glance before David whispered, "Richard said we were beggars for eating at Grandpa's house... Mom didn't open the door for two days, and we were hungry..."

Two days without opening the door?

Michael's chest tightened.

"Did you ever think that maybe Mom was sick?"

David nodded. "We only found out after we woke her up..."

Michael ruffled his son's hair, his heart aching.

The boys were still so young. After the chaos following his failed college entrance exam, they must have been terrified.

He swore silently—no one would ever hurt his family again.
###Chapter 74: Suspicious Kindness

"Mommy's been so nice to us lately!" Tommy exclaimed excitedly, tugging at his father's hand. "David, tell Daddy about all the yummy things we've eaten!"

David began counting on his fingers, his eyes lighting up with each item: "Milk powder, sponge cake, wild berries, sweet potato balls, noodles, eggs, meat, ribs..." He paused for breath before continuing, "And milk candies, cookies, and canned fruit!"

Michael Stone frowned. So many luxuries? What were his in-laws up to?

In the past, the most they'd ever sent was half a pound of cookies or a few pieces of sponge cake, with the occasional canned fruit as a rare treat. Why this sudden generosity—money and goods alike?

What exactly had they written in that letter? Were they trying to get Emily to return to the city?

His guard went up immediately. As the saying goes, beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

It wasn't that he wanted to think the worst of his in-laws. But in all their years of marriage, Emily had never once visited her parents. That alone was strange. The gifts they sent almost seemed like consolation prizes.

"Daddy, look!" Tommy hopped around proudly, showing off his new rubber shoes. "Mommy bought these for me! Aren't they pretty?"

Michael crouched down to examine the shoes. Rubber shoes required industrial vouchers—they weren't cheap. Both boys wore brand-new nylon socks, their cheeks rosy with health.

Ever since his wife lost her memory, she'd stopped demanding to return to the city. Instead, she doted on the children endlessly. The change filled him with both relief and unease.

"Mommy's studying at home. Be good and don't disturb her," Michael reminded them.

Suddenly, David looked up. "Daddy, if Mommy gets into university, will she take us with her?"

The question hit Michael like a punch to the chest.

"Of course," he said firmly, crouching to meet their eyes. "Wherever Mommy goes to school, Daddy will take you there too. We'll be her support team."

"What's a support team?"

"It means..." Michael thought for a moment. "Mommy studies, and we cook for her."

"Yay!" The boys cheered and hugged each other, their faces breaking into the carefree smiles he hadn't seen in so long.

In the next room, Emily Johnson listened to the children's laughter, her heart swelling with bittersweet emotion. Lately, the boys had been watching her with wary eyes, as if afraid she might vanish the moment they blinked.

Dinner was cooked by Michael—golden crispy pancakes and fragrant stir-fried dishes. Who knew the man could cook so well?

Late that night, as Michael moved to enter their bedroom, Emily blocked the doorway.

"I've lost my memories," she said, meeting his gaze directly. "We're practically strangers now. Sharing a bed would be uncomfortable."

The words struck him like lightning. No longer allowed to sleep in the same room as his wife?

"You don't want this?" Emily narrowed her eyes. If he truly objected, he'd have moved out long ago. Why wait until now?

Her question doused Michael like a bucket of cold water. Didn't want it? How could he possibly refuse?
###Chapter 75: The Secret of the Golden Finger

"Emily, I'll sleep in David and Tommy's room tonight. The kids might get suspicious," Michael Stone said, standing at the doorway with a slight frown.

Emily Johnson kept her back to him, her voice calm. "Explain it however you want."

As the door clicked shut, she finally exhaled in relief. Her fingers absently traced the edge of the pillowcase, her thoughts churning.

She had managed to stabilize the male lead, but her identity as the original female antagonist loomed like a ticking time bomb.

How long could the "amnesia" excuse hold? What if she was exposed?

Her grip tightened on the blanket. Should she tell Michael that his real wife was gone? That this was the world of a book?

Who would believe such a wild tale?

Moonlight streamed through the window as she pulled out the phone hidden beneath her pillow. The screen illuminated her pale face—her only lifeline.

Dawn broke with the crow of a rooster. Emily jolted awake, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar adobe walls.

"Mommy!" Two small figures barreled toward the bed. Tommy's eyes sparkled. "Daddy made steamed eggs!"

The aroma of food drifted from the kitchen. Michael turned, wiping sweat from his brow, an apron tied around his waist. "I'm thinking of inviting my army buddies over for dinner."

Emily's fingers twitched. So many people... her secret...

"Alright," she forced a steady tone. "I'll soak some seaweed."

Once Michael left to buy meat, she quickly tapped on her phone. Dried seaweed, shrimp flakes... She deliberately left small amounts of each in the cupboard.

"Mommy, it's raining!" David rushed in, his bangs dripping.

Through the downpour, Michael staggered back, pushing his bicycle. A pig's head swung from the handlebars, rainwater dripping from its bristles.

"Why did you buy that?" Emily took the heavy parcel.

Michael wiped his face. "Heard pig's head makes the best drinking snack." Then he lowered his voice. "Peter Wilson mentioned... someone's been asking about you."

The seaweed slipped from Emily's fingers, splashing into the basin. In the rippling water, her pupils contracted sharply.
###Chapter 76: Apprehension Before the Division

Rain fell in dense, slanting sheets as the villagers hurried home with their farming tools.

"William, your brother is back," Patricia whispered, her eyes darting nervously.

William Stone paused, his pipe hovering mid-air. "I heard yesterday."

Suddenly, he remembered his father's words—once Michael returned, the family would divide. The rain showed no sign of stopping, and with no work in the fields, this was the perfect time for the split.

Patricia rubbed her hands anxiously. "You don’t think he’ll come looking for trouble, do you?" She recalled her fight with Emily and how Richard had bullied David and Tommy. Her stomach twisted with unease.

William paled. Michael had never cared much for brotherly bonds.

"What can we do?" He crushed the pipe’s embers underfoot. "We can only hope he shows mercy."

Meanwhile, Michael was busy simmering bone broth. Pork bones and seaweed rolled in the pot, filling the air with a rich aroma.

"Emily, I’ll call them for dinner," he said, grabbing an umbrella. "Keep an eye on the fire."

Emily nodded and turned to slice the boiled pork belly. Two pots steamed on the stove—one for the broth, the other ready for braised pork.

"Mom, I'm hungry," Tommy whined, clinging to the counter.

"Just a little longer," Emily assured him, swiftly chopping the meat before kneading dough for pan-fried dumplings.

Michael soon returned, trailed by a small crowd.

"Michael, what’s cooking? Smells amazing!" Charles Clark boomed as he stepped inside.

Mary lifted the lid and gasped at the golden dumplings encircling the braised pork. "Emily, your cooking’s improved!"

Emily smiled faintly, flipping the sizzling vegetables with her spatula. From the corner of her eye, she noticed William and Patricia lingering at the gate, their expressions uneasy.

"William, Patricia, come in," Michael said, his tone unreadable.

William forced himself forward, heart pounding. This meal wouldn’t be easy to swallow.
###Chapter 77: Burning Hands

"Charles, did you come alone?"

Charles Clark scratched his head. "Yeah, just me."

He peeked into the kitchen. "Michael, need any help?"

The dishes on the stove were nearly ready.

"No need, it's almost done," Emily Johnson said with a smile, waving him off. "Go wait in the living room."

Charles nodded and turned away.

"Uncle Charles!" The two little boys chirped in unison.

Charles crouched down and pinched their cheeks. "Wow, you've both put on weight and gotten fairer."

It had only been a month since he last saw them, but the boys had clearly grown rounder.

"Uncle Charles..."

Samuel Bright and Daniel River joined in, teasing the children. Daniel playfully asked David, "Tell me, what delicious food did your mom make?"

David counted on his fingers. "Braised pork, seaweed soup... Mom said there's also fish-flavored eggplant."

Just then, Emily walked in with a steaming plate of braised pork. The rich aroma instantly filled the room.

"Dinner's ready!"

Everyone gathered around the table, eyes wide. Golden pan-fried dumplings, glistening braised pork, refreshing cold sliced pork head, and piping hot seaweed soup.

The meal was exceptionally delicious. Even those who often traveled for business rarely enjoyed such a feast.

After dinner, Emily stood to clear the dishes. Michael Stone helped.

"I'll wash the dishes," Emily said.

They had used a lot of oil today—dish soap was a must.

"Thanks, sweetheart," Michael murmured in her ear.

In the living room, the children were sent off to play. John Stone Sr. stood and said to his son, "Michael, come to the old house tonight."

"Got it, Dad."

Once his parents left, only the four of them remained.

Michael took out a cloth bundle containing their earnings. He carefully counted and divided the money into four shares.

"This is yours, yours..."

"Thanks, Michael!"

"You're the best, Michael!"

By the time the money was distributed, the rain had stopped. The group said their goodbyes and left.

Emily finished washing the dishes and ran into Michael. He handed her a thick stack of bills—easily over a thousand.

"For you," he said.

Emily froze. The average worker only made thirty-something a month. This was a year's salary for most people.

"I don’t want it. Keep it yourself."

"We didn’t invest much, so the profit isn’t big," Michael said flatly.

Emily nearly choked. This wasn’t big?

"Then keep it as capital."

She wasn’t the original owner—this money burned her hands.
###Chapter 78: Locked Out by His Wife

"Emily..." Michael Stone clenched the stack of bills, his Adam's apple bobbing nervously.

Emily Johnson quickly pushed the money back into his hands. "I still have savings. You keep this for your business. Who knows if the policies have loosened yet?"

The coastal city had indeed opened up. Michael planned another trip before New Year's—festive seasons always meant good sales.

But the current situation unsettled him. His wife was earning her own money while refusing his support due to her "amnesia," leaving him grasping at sand slipping through his fingers.

"Keep it. I'm going to study." Before he could react, Emily hurried into their bedroom and slammed the door.

Michael stared at the closed door, the joy of their financial windfall evaporating instantly.

Since losing her memory, Emily hadn't argued or complained—she just looked at him like he was a stranger. That indifference cut deeper than any quarrel.

He raked a hand through his hair in frustration. Last night, he should've swallowed his pride and stayed in the master bedroom. Now he'd been banished to the children's room.

Turning, he pushed open the nursery door. His two boys lay on their stomachs poring over picture books—treasures from Michael's last business trip. Though they couldn't read most words, the illustrations kept them entertained for hours.

"Daddy?" Tommy tilted his head. "Why aren't you in your room?"

The question caught Michael off guard. Should he admit their mother had kicked him out? The boys had been asleep when he moved in last night, and he'd risen before them this morning—so far, they remained oblivious to their father's predicament.

"Can you understand the story?" he deflected awkwardly.

David held up his book. "Daddy, there are too many words we don't know."

"Mom's teaching us the Three Character Classic!" Tommy kicked his feet excitedly. "Men at their birth... Mom hasn't taught us the rest yet."

Michael ruffled their hair. "Such clever boys." The praise tasted bittersweet. City children their age attended kindergarten, but the village school only accepted seven-year-olds.

Kicking off his shoes, he climbed onto the bed and gathered his sons against him. "Come, let Daddy tell you a story."

Through the thin walls, Emily faintly heard her husband's deep voice. Setting down her textbook, she propped her chin on her hand, lost in thought.

How long could she maintain this amnesia charade? What if Michael insisted on returning to their bed tonight? Could she keep her distance sharing blankets with him?

Frustrated, she tugged at her hair. Nine months remained until college entrance exams—how would she survive this arrangement?
###Chapter 79: The Return to the City

Emily Johnson sat by the window, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her dress. The cicadas buzzed relentlessly outside, but their noise did nothing to ease the restlessness in her heart.

The thought of divorce lingered in her mind, refusing to fade.

"Go back to my parents' house?" She scoffed at the idea. The family of the original owner, who favored sons over daughters, would only see her as a burden. The educated youth dormitory wasn’t a long-term solution either—since the policy had loosened, most of its residents had already left.

Rent a place in town? The supplies from PennyDeals could ensure she never went hungry. But the moment she pictured David and Tommy’s bright, hopeful eyes, her heart melted into a puddle.

"Damn it..." Emily rubbed her temples. In her past life, she had been known for her iron will—so why did she have so many attachments now that she was trapped in this novel?

And then there was Michael Stone. The way he looked at her had grown deeper, as if trying to pull her into an abyss. How much longer could she keep up the amnesia act? She had no idea.

Snapping her book shut, Emily raked a hand through her hair in frustration. After over twenty years of never falling for anyone, was she really about to lose her heart in this fictional world?

Outside, Michael stood silently in the moonlight, its silver glow softening his sharp features. Watching her troubled expression through the window, his lips curved into an unconscious, tender smile.

"Dad?" David rubbed his sleepy eyes as he appeared behind him.

Michael crouched down, pressing a finger to his lips. "Mom’s studying. Let’s not disturb her."

Meanwhile, in the educated youth dormitory, Sophia Green was pacing like a trapped animal. The moment she heard Michael had returned, her enamel mug clattered to the floor.

"This is bad, this is bad..." She gnawed at her nails nervously. If Emily told anyone about that night—

Sophia suddenly lunged for the cabinet, digging out her saved ration coupons and money. She had to leave this godforsaken place as soon as possible!

"Captain Stone, I want to return to the city!" She burst into the office, her hair disheveled from running.

John Stone Sr. looked up from his ledger, his gaze sharp. This troublemaking educated youth, who had incited his daughter-in-law to seek a divorce, was someone he’d been waiting to deal with.

"Fill out the form." The old captain slowly pushed a sheet of paper toward her. "But I’ll warn you—without a receiving unit in the city..."

"I know!" Sophia snatched the pen, her hand trembling as she signed. At this point, she’d marry a cripple if it meant escaping!

Watching her sprint away, John Stone Sr. smirked and pulled out the letter his son had left behind.

[Dad, let her go. What’s waiting for her in the city is far worse than anything here.]

The shadow of the old locust tree stretched across the letter like an unfurling net.
###Chapter 80: The Family Division Dispute

Rain slanted against the window lattice as Michael Stone stepped into the old house, his straw raincoat dripping. The rhythmic patter of water from the eaves filled the air.

"Uncle's here!" Lily's bright voice called from the kitchen.

Michael shook the water from his raincoat, his gaze sweeping over Richard and George Jr., who shrank back like frightened quails in the corner—clearly still remembering the last time they'd been disciplined.

"Father. Mother." He strode into the main hall, where his two older brothers, Robert and William, were already seated at the square table.

John Stone Sr. tapped his pipe, the gray smoke curling in the dim glow of the kerosene lamp. "Michael's here. Sit down."

From the kitchen came the clatter of dishes as Lily and her sisters cleared the remnants of dinner. Mary emerged from the inner room carrying a red cloth bundle. She unwrapped it layer by layer, revealing a stack of crumpled bills.

"Three hundred twenty dollars, sixty-eight cents," she said, her fingers brushing over the money. "Your father and I have decided to split it equally among the three families."

"Mother!" Patricia's voice rose sharply. "Didn't Michael already get his share when he moved out?"

The room fell so silent that the raindrops hitting the roof tiles became deafening.

Michael narrowed his eyes, catching the calculating glint in his sister-in-law's expression. Slowly, he rolled up his sleeves, revealing the firm lines of muscle along his arms.

"Forgotten already?" His tone was measured. "When I left, I didn’t take so much as a chopstick from this house."

Mary slammed her palm on the table. "Patricia! The money for Michael’s house came from his wife’s family. If you’re so envious, why don’t you ask your family to build you one?"

Patricia flushed scarlet, opening her mouth to retort, but William yanked her back with a sharp tug.

A soft scoff came from the corner. Elizabeth, stitching a shoe sole, ran her needle through her hair, her lips curling in faint derision.

"I remember," Michael said, his voice like ice, "when Patricia married into this family, she didn’t even have a decent quilt to her name."

The rain suddenly intensified, heavy drops hammering against the stone pavement like the firecrackers from that long-ago wedding day. Patricia’s face drained of color, her nails digging into her palms.

John’s pipe struck the table with a decisive crack. "The money gets split three ways. Anyone who objects can get out of the Stone family!"

The kerosene lamp’s flame flickered violently, casting the shadows of their varied expressions onto the mottled earthen walls. Outside, a thunderclap split the sky, illuminating the cold glint in Michael’s eyes.
###Chapter 81: The Family Division Feud

"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Anyone watching this would think you're selling off a daughter!" Michael Stone crossed his legs and deliberately drawled his words. "Not like my wife's family—they refused the dowry outright. If I hadn't forced it on them, people would've thought I was the one marrying into her family!"

He smirked, rocking his head smugly. "All these years, her parents keep sending money and food. My life’s been so hard, tsk tsk..."

Elizabeth Stone clenched the hem of her shirt, while William kept his head down, not daring to make a sound. Both thought the same thing: Why does Michael always say the worst possible thing at the worst possible time?

"Shut your mouth!" John Stone Sr. shot a glare at Patricia before turning to his youngest son with a resigned shake of his head.

Patricia stomped her foot in frustration but was yanked back by her husband. She wanted to storm off, but the thought of the upcoming property division kept her rooted in place.

"About the three hundred dollars..." John cleared his throat. "I plan to split it three ways—"

"Dad!" Michael cut in. "It should be four shares!" He nudged his brothers. "Right, Robert? William?"

Robert and William exchanged uneasy glances before mumbling, "F-four shares..."

Patricia nearly erupted, but William clapped a hand over her mouth just in time.

John saw right through it. His elder sons hadn’t even considered setting aside a share for him and his wife—only this troublemaker of a youngest son remembered.

"Fine. Four shares." He finalized the decision, though inwardly he sighed. Michael may be well-off now, but he still gets his fair share. Can’t have him becoming someone else’s son-in-law for real.

When it came to dividing food and household items, Michael waved them off. Then he casually remarked, "Dad, aren’t Robert and William planning to build new houses?"

Elizabeth’s bowl clattered to the floor.

"I’ve heard..." Michael drawled, "that soon, homestead land will have to be bought. If they don’t claim it now, they’ll have to pay later." He winked at Robert. "Just looking out for you."

Robert gaped, then turned to his father for help.

John narrowed his eyes. "Michael, who told you that?"

"If you don’t believe me, ask at the Supply & Market." Michael shrugged, a glint of calculation in his eyes. He’d planned this—using the family division to push both brothers out.

The old house would stay with his parents. Any gifts of food? Only for them.

As for Robert and Elizabeth? One was spineless, the other petty.
William and Patricia? One was cowardly, the other shrewish.

The only people Michael Stone intended to care for were his parents.
###Chapter 82: The Family Division Dispute

"Old man, we can still pick a good spot for the homestead now," Mary Stone whispered urgently. "Once the new policy rolls in and the other villagers start scrambling, do you think Robert and William will get decent land?"

John Stone Sr. slammed his hand on the table. "William moves out, and so does Robert!"

Elizabeth Stone clenched the hem of her shirt, her nails nearly digging into her palm. She had hoped that with William gone, little Jack would finally have his own room. Now that dream was shattered.

"Now that we've settled the division, let's talk about supporting our parents," Michael Stone said, his gaze sweeping over his two older brothers. "Their hair has turned white—it's time we fulfill our filial duties."

Robert Stone nodded eagerly. "Of course we'll take care of them!" William quickly echoed his agreement. Neither dared to refuse—not when Michael's fists were known to settle arguments.

The three brothers finally agreed: each household would contribute five dollars a month, fifty pounds of fine and coarse grains, increasing by ten percent each year. Once the agreement was signed in black and white, Michael stood to leave.

"If you need help, just say the word," he paused, then added, "Blood is thicker than water."

The words stung.

Later, after the elderly couple had gone to bed, Mary suddenly pulled out a stack of bills. "Michael slipped me his share."

John was stunned.

"You always say I favor him," Mary murmured, running her fingers over the money. "But which of our sons is truly the most filial? Maybe it's for the best that Robert moves out. Our work points are enough to feed us, and with the grain they'll provide..."

"I had hoped Michael would pull them up..." the old man sighed.

In the eldest son's house, Robert was trying to placate his wife. "If we don't claim the homestead now, we'll lose our chance later. Lily can help with chores—we just need to work hard."

Meanwhile, the second son's household was in chaos.

"How dare Michael give them money!" William's wife shrieked. "Living off his wife's family and still acting high and mighty!"

William stayed silent. If he had a wealthy mother-in-law, he wouldn’t mind either.

That night, Michael climbed over the courtyard wall. Seeing the main house dark, he tiptoed into his sons' room. The two little rascals slept like wild animals, kicking so much he had to grit his teeth.

At breakfast the next morning, he pulled out a document. "We divided the family last night. I gave Mother the money—here are the details of our support agreement."


###Chapter 83: Are You Insulting Me?

"Division of the family?"

"Alimony?"

"All the money was returned to Mother-in-law?"

Emily Johnson took the thin sheet of paper, her fingertips trembling slightly. At the very bottom, the signatures of the three brothers were clearly written.

The terms were laid out plainly: The division would take effect after this year's autumn harvest. The support payments would begin next year.

Each household was required to pay five dollars, fifty pounds of fine grain, and fifty pounds of coarse grain annually.

What was even more alarming was that the amount would increase by one-tenth the following year.

This meant next year’s payment would be five dollars and fifty cents, fifty-five pounds of fine grain, and fifty-five pounds of coarse grain.

And it would keep increasing every year.

"The amount isn’t that large," Emily murmured to herself.

Fine grain referred to snow-white rice and wheat flour.

Coarse grain included golden corn, purple-red sweet potatoes, and dark red sorghum.

Combined, the three households would only pay fifteen dollars, one hundred fifty pounds of fine grain, and one hundred fifty pounds of coarse grain per year.

On average, the two elderly parents would receive less than a pound of grain per day.

In modern times, with meat, eggs, milk, and fruit as supplements, this amount would be more than enough.

But in the lean 1970s, when oil and meat were scarce...

"Father can still earn work points now, but after the Household Contract System is implemented..." Michael Stone trailed off.

Emily raised an eyebrow. "You actually know about this? And you didn’t warn Father and the others?"

"The policy won’t take effect immediately—it’ll take at least two or three years." He paused, then abruptly changed the subject. "After this autumn rain, the wild game in the mountains should be out. What do you want to eat?"

"Meat! We want meat!" The two children jumped up and down, clearly not satisfied with yesterday’s meal.

"Alright, we’ll go hunting in the mountains today." Michael ruffled the children’s hair, then gave Emily a meaningful look. "And we’ll pick some walnuts—good for the brain."

Emily narrowed her eyes.

Why did that sound so pointed?

"Pick plenty, then. The whole family could use some brain-boosting," she said with a tight smile.

Michael felt a chill run down his neck.

Had he said something wrong? Wasn’t it common knowledge that walnuts were good for the mind?

His wife studied late into the night every day...

"The ground is muddy outside—stay home and behave." He hurriedly gave the instruction before stepping out.

Outside the courtyard gate, Daniel River had been waiting for some time.

"Third Brother, I heard your family split?" the younger man asked in a hushed voice.

"Yeah, completely divided now." Michael patted his cousin’s shoulder. "You should apply for homestead land too. Build a house—it’ll be easier to find a wife."

The youngest of the Stone family scratched his head. "I was thinking of picking land close to yours."

"Let’s set more traps today and gather extra walnuts." Michael suddenly sighed. "Your sister-in-law could use some brain food."

Daniel hesitated. "Third Brother, is Sister-in-law still preparing for the college entrance exam?"

After this trip to the city, he had truly seen the gap between urban and rural life. No wonder his sister-in-law was so determined to return.

"Yeah."

"What if... she doesn’t pass again?" Daniel asked cautiously. "Will you still support her?"

Michael gazed at the distant rolling mountains. "University is tuition-free, and graduates are assigned jobs. It’s a chance to change her fate."

His voice was quiet, but every word carried weight.
###Chapter 84: The Crossroads of Fate

"Michael, how come the news about the college entrance exam resuming came so suddenly?" Daniel River squatted on the doorstep, cracking wild walnuts between his teeth.

Michael Stone paused while repairing his hoe. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across his chiseled face.

"The educated youth from the city are studying like mad," Daniel spat out a shell. "They say if you get into college, the government pays you, and assigns you a job after graduation."

Michael's grip tightened on the hoe. He remembered Emily Johnson's focused profile as she bent over her books, her slender fingers turning the pages.

"Michael, you graduated high school too," Daniel suddenly leaned closer. "Why don't you take the exam?"

The hoe clattered to the ground. Michael looked up to see the eager glint in Daniel's eyes.

"Me?" His voice came out hoarse. "There are still two kids at home..."

"If Emily passes the exam, you two would..." Daniel trailed off, but the implication was clear.

Something heavy struck Michael's chest. He thought of the abandoned husbands in the village, their hollow stares.

"I'll...think about it."

The two men gathered walnuts in silence deep in the mountains. Michael's basket gradually filled, yet his heart felt emptier by the minute.

"Michael, that enough?" Daniel wiped his brow.

"Yeah." Michael answered absently. Rabbits scurried frantically in their trap as he mechanically grabbed one.

"Take it to Samuel's family."

On the way back, villagers eyed Michael's full basket curiously.

"Michael, been to the mountains?" a commune member called out.

"Just gathering walnuts," he replied curtly, not breaking stride.

Two small figures came barreling toward him at the doorstep.

"Daddy!"

Michael caught his children in his arms, but his gaze instinctively searched for that familiar silhouette.

In the kitchen, Emily fed firewood into the stove. Flames danced across her fair complexion, damp tendrils clinging to her forehead.

"Dinner ready?" He set down the basket.

"Waiting for you to cook the vegetables." She looked up, eyes bright.

At the table, watching his wife serve their children, Michael suddenly said, "I'll plant some turnips and cabbage in our private plot this afternoon."

Emily's chopsticks stilled. "Alright."

She didn't see the turmoil in her husband's eyes. Michael shoveled rice into his mouth, his mind a stormy sea.

The college entrance exam loomed between them like a great divide. And he—he had to make a choice.
###Chapter 85: The Leaky Roof Nightmare

Emily Johnson was planning her idyllic countryside life but hadn't quite mastered the art of gardening yet. What vegetables should be planted in which season? She had no clue.

"I remember you like cabbage noodles. I’ll sow some cabbage seeds in the corner of the yard," Michael Stone said as he cleaned the rabbit. "And some peas too—we can pick the tender shoots for noodles later."

"Whatever you think is best," Emily replied absentmindedly.

She truly knew nothing about farming. This land would rely entirely on him. Even the original owner’s memories held no knowledge of agricultural work.

"Emily, how should we cook the rabbit?" Michael asked, holding up the cleaned meat.

"Ginger rabbit?" The words slipped out before she could stop herself. Her heart skipped a beat. How would an amnesiac know this dish? Maybe dry pot rabbit would’ve been safer.

"Sure." Michael agreed without hesitation.

He didn’t suspect a thing?

At dinner, the aroma of ginger rabbit filled the air. Emily took a bite—spicy, savory, and perfectly seasoned.

"You’re really good at cooking."

Michael’s lips curved slightly. "I learn fast. Had this dish at a restaurant last time."

"Daddy, spicy!" Tommy stuck out his tongue, hopping in place.

"Drink some water." Michael hurriedly poured water for the kids, forgetting they couldn’t handle heat.

"But the meat’s yummy!" David happily munched away.

Michael noticed his wife had a particular fondness for this spicy dish.

Late at night, the sound of raindrops pattering against the roof grew louder.

"Emily! Emily!"

She jolted awake to urgent calls. Outside, the storm raged, but inside—dripping water?

"Who—?"

"Mommy!"

The children’s cries snapped her fully awake.

"Emily, the kids’ room is leaking! How’s yours?"

Leaking? Emily bolted out of bed.

She flung open the door to find Michael rushing in, clutching two soaked little figures.

"The roof tiles are old. Heavy rain outside means light rain inside."

The kerosene lamp flickered to life. The boys, now stripped down, burrowed under the blankets, shivering.

If they weren’t dried off, they’d catch a cold!

"Stay with them. I’ll get buckets," Michael said, turning to leave.

Emily grabbed his arm. "In this downpour?"

"If we don’t, where will the three of us sleep later?"

The brick-tile house had only three rooms—two bedrooms, a main hall, plus a kitchen, bathroom, and woodshed.

"Fine..."

Emily turned to grab towels. The boys’ hair was still dripping.

"Mommy..."

"Cold?"

"Not cold! Come sleep with us!"

Dawn was still hours away. The little ones had been half-asleep when carried over.

"Okay."


###Chapter 86 Warmth in the Rainy Night

The October night rain tapped against the windowpanes, carrying a hint of chill.

Emily Johnson had just slipped under the covers when two bare little bodies wriggled in beside her, clinging to her like tiny eels. She instinctively shifted toward the inner side of the bed, making space for the man who would soon join them.

"Is the roof holding up?" she asked softly.

Michael Stone stood by the bed, his tall frame outlined by the moonlight. "A few leaks, but I've set out pans to catch the water," he replied, his voice deep and carrying the dampness of the rainy night.

The bed creaked slightly as he lay down. The modest-sized mattress suddenly felt cramped, and Emily could distinctly sense the warmth radiating from him through the children. The faint scent of soap mixed with his masculine presence made her tense involuntarily.

"Can't sleep?" Michael reached over their sleeping son, David, to tuck the blanket around her. His rough fingertips brushed her cheek by accident, sending a subtle shiver through her.

"Once the rain stops tomorrow, I'll check the riverbank," he murmured. "They say after heavy rains like this, you can find plenty of fish washed up."

Emily's eyes lit up. Wild fish! A rare delicacy in modern times. Suddenly excited, she blurted, "I want to go too."

"The paths will be muddy," Michael frowned. "And there'll be crowds—"

"I have rubber boots," she interrupted, her tone carrying an unconscious note of pleading. She desperately needed fresh air—being cooped up all day was suffocating.

In the darkness, she felt his gaze linger on her face for a long moment.

"We'll see when the rain eases," he finally conceded, a hint of amused resignation in his voice.

The steady patter of rain gradually became a lullaby. Emily had expected to lie awake, but instead, she drifted off quickly. In her drowsy haze, she thought she felt something soft and warm press against her forehead—light as a feather.

By the faint glow from the window, Michael studied his wife's peaceful sleeping face. The two boys had somehow rolled to the center of the bed, limbs splayed, claiming most of the space. Carefully, he adjusted the blankets over all three of them, his lips curving into an unconscious smile.

That night, the leaky roof and damp air no longer mattered.

Morning came, but the rain hadn’t stopped.

When Emily opened her eyes, she found David and Tommy already dressed, kneeling by the bed and flipping through picture books. Michael stood at the window, frowning at the relentless downpour.

"Awake?" He turned, his handsome features softened by the morning light. "The rain won’t let up anytime soon."

Emily gazed at the torrent outside and realized—this autumn rain seemed to have quietly soaked something else as well.
###Chapter 87: A Warm Rainy Night

"I made some noodles and reheated the leftover rabbit meat from last night..." Emily Johnson said softly, placing a steaming bowl on the small table.

Instead of eating in the main hall, they chose to have their meal in the bedroom. Outside, the rain poured relentlessly, but inside, the room was filled with a cozy warmth.

"This rain doesn’t look like it’ll stop anytime soon," Michael Stone remarked, glancing out the window with an air of finality. "After breakfast, just focus on your reading. No going out today."

No going out? Emily suppressed a scoff. With rain this heavy, she wasn’t foolish enough to step outside.

The family gathered around the small table for breakfast, the steady rhythm of rain providing a constant backdrop.

"That lightning last night was really scary," Tommy suddenly piped up, his little face still tinged with fear.

Lightning? Emily thought of the towering skyscrapers in the 21st century, all equipped with lightning rods—nothing like this village, where a single flash could illuminate the entire settlement.

"I need to go out for a bit," Michael announced abruptly, pulling on his straw raincoat and wide-brimmed hat before heading out the door.

The neighboring room had leaked, soaking the bedding. Until it dried, the two boys would have to squeeze into their parents' room.

"Mom, you can study. We promise we won’t disturb you," David said earnestly.

Tommy nodded quickly. "Yeah, we’ll be super quiet!"

The moment Michael left, Emily dug out some snacks from the cupboard. "It’s fine, I don’t need to study right now," she said with a smile, preparing warm milk for the boys. "Here, have something to eat first."

The children’s eyes lit up as they accepted the treats. Watching them sip their milk carefully, Emily’s heart melted.

She had worked so hard to help them gain a little weight—she couldn’t let all that effort go to waste. Thankfully, Michael had brought back plenty of powdered milk, allowing her to secretly add extra nutrients without anyone noticing.

Emily never imagined she’d resort to such measures. But seeing how well-behaved and thoughtful these two little boys were, she found it all worthwhile. Unlike other children their age, they weren’t mischievous—instead, they were eager to help, whether it was tending the fire, washing dishes, or sweeping the yard.

Meanwhile, Michael trudged through the mud toward the river. The once-clear water had turned murky overnight, its rapid currents slamming against the rocks along the bank.

"Michael, you came too?" Charles Clark called out, also clad in a straw raincoat, scanning the river for fish. The season wasn’t too cold yet, so wading in barefoot wasn’t a problem.

"Thankfully, my dad fixed the roof after the harvest, or it’d be leaking for sure," Charles said, wiping rainwater from his face. "How about your place?"

The village, nestled against the mountains, still had many homes made of adobe with thatched roofs. The experienced elders had long since repaired their roofs, while those who’d neglected the task now faced indoor drizzles.

"It leaked," Michael answered curtly.

And that was precisely why he and Emily were now sharing a room. When she’d suggested there was no rush to fix the roof, he’d agreed without hesitation—even if the boys were there, being under the same roof with his wife was exactly what he wanted.

He needed her to grow accustomed to his presence.

"Need help?" Charles glanced at Michael’s injury. "That wound hasn’t fully healed yet. Climbing up on the roof would be tough."

"No need." Michael shook his head, then suddenly pointed at the river. "Give me a hand here..."

A group of men had already gathered by the riverbank, braving the rain to fish. Having grown up by the water, they were all strong swimmers—a little rain meant nothing to them.

Back at the old Stone family home, the rotation of cooking duties had prevented any major disputes. Still, the heavy rain only worsened the already-dilapidated state of the house.

"Michael left in such a hurry. I don’t think their roof’s been fixed yet," Mary Stone fretted, watching the downpour through the window. "Who knows how bad the leaks are over there."
###Chapter 88: Salvation in the Storm

The downpour raged outside, heavy raindrops drumming against the roof like a relentless percussion.

John Stone Sr. sat in the main room, leisurely pulling out his pipe. He squinted through the window where rainwater cascaded from the eaves like a shimmering curtain.

"Good rain," he murmured, exhaling a slow curl of smoke. "The wheat fields will drink their fill."

Suddenly, hurried footsteps shattered the quiet.

"Captain Stone! Trouble!" The messenger was drenched, his voice trembling. "Ethan—Ethan fell into the river!"

John shot to his feet, his pipe clattering to the floor. He snatched the straw raincoat his wife handed him and bolted outside, splashing through the mud.

Ethan Miller was the village's unluckiest child. Orphaned young, he lived with his brother and sister-in-law, who begrudged him every bite. These past rainy days, they hadn't even given him a warm meal.

"Poor boy must've been starving," John thought, his heart aching as he trudged forward.

A crowd had gathered by the raging river. All that was visible of Ethan was a thin, flailing arm above the churning water.

"Michael, I'll go!" Charles Clark tore off his raincoat and plunged into the icy current.

Michael Stone swiftly snapped a thick branch from a nearby tree and shouted, "Charles, grab this!"

The river fought back, nearly sweeping Charles away multiple times. But at last, he seized the half-drowned boy.

"Pull!" Michael commanded. The villagers heaved together, dragging them both ashore.

Ethan lay deathly pale, not breathing.

"Move!" Michael dropped to his knees, pressing hard on the boy's chest. One push, two—rain and sweat streaked down his forehead.

With a violent cough, Ethan spewed water and gasped for air.

"He's alive!" The crowd erupted in cheers.

John arrived just then, torn between pride and worry at the sight of his youngest son soaked to the bone.

"Take him to the clinic."

Ethan weakly shook his head. "I... I can't pay..."

Without a word, Michael hoisted him up. "You're coming home. We've got ginger tea and dry clothes."

Back at the house, three curious little faces peered at the stranger.

"This is Uncle Ethan," Michael explained simply. "He fell in the river. Needs warming up."

Emily Johnson was already stirring a pot of porridge in the kitchen. Spotting them, she quickly added brown sugar. "This'll help fight the chill."

Ethan clutched the steaming cup, tears plopping into the sweet liquid. It had been so long since he'd known such kindness.

"Michael..." The boy's voice cracked.

Michael patted his shoulder. "Change first. Don't catch cold."

Outside, the storm raged on. But inside, warmth bloomed.
###Chapter 89: The First Full Meal After Harvest

Emily Johnson stepped into the kitchen and was startled by the sight of a boy as thin as a bamboo pole. The boy, about five feet tall with sun-darkened skin glistening in the sunlight, stood awkwardly by the stove.

"Hello..." she greeted softly.

Brown sugar dissolved slowly in the ginger tea, filling the air with sweetness.

"Have a bowl too," Emily said, handing the bowl to the boy.

Michael Stone quickly chimed in, "I'll have some, I'll have some."

Ethan Miller carefully accepted the bowl. The sweetness of the sugar tempered the ginger's sharpness, and as he took small sips, his eyes lit up. It was only the second time in his memory he had tasted something sweet.

Charles Clark barged in energetically, carrying fishing gear. "Third Brother, I brought back all the fish!"

"Sister-in-law..." He scratched his head sheepishly.

"There's more ginger tea in the pot. Come have a bowl," Emily offered.

Charles wrinkled his nose. He hated the taste of ginger tea. But under Michael's sharp glance, he had no choice but to step forward reluctantly.

"Huh?" Discovering the brown sugar in the tea, Charles brightened and downed the bowl in one gulp. "Third Brother, Sister-in-law, I'll go change first."

"Go ahead."

Emily eagerly peered into the bucket. Murky water swirled with several crucian carp and common carp, while tiny fish and shrimp darted between them. The most eye-catching was a silver carp over a pound in weight, its scales glinting under the sunlight.

"Fish soup?" she suggested.

Michael leaned close to her ear. "The big one for sour fish stew, the small ones for soup."

Before Emily could respond, a loud growl erupted from Ethan's stomach. The boy flushed crimson and clutched his belly in embarrassment.

"I..."

"Go play with David and Tommy," Emily said gently. "Leave the kitchen to your Third Brother."

Ethan gave her a grateful look and followed her out.

"Ethan!" The two little boys rushed over excitedly.

Emily poured half a mug of powdered milk. "David, share your snacks with Ethan."

David immediately pulled out a breadstick and handed it to Ethan. The boy swallowed hard but pushed the malt drink back toward the children.

"We've had ours. You drink it, Ethan," Tommy said in his tiny voice.

"Go on, it'll spoil if you leave it too long," Emily urged.

Ethan took a cautious sip, and his eyes widened in amazement. It was even sweeter than the brown sugar water—a flavor he'd never experienced before.

At lunchtime, Ethan's hands trembled as he held his bowl. It was his first full meal after the harvest. Though mixed with sweet potatoes, rice made up most of it. The aroma of the sour fish stew made him devour two bowls.

"Don't just eat the pickled vegetables—have more fish," Emily said, serving him another helping.

Michael watched enviously as his wife piled food onto Ethan's plate while his own bowl remained empty.

Only then did Emily notice her husband's pitiful gaze. Smiling, she placed half a fish head in his bowl. "Eat up!"

A fish head was still something. Michael grinned to himself—it was the first time his wife had ever served him food.
###Chapter 90: The Endless Autumn Rain

The rain had been falling relentlessly since noon, showing no signs of stopping. Ethan Miller stood at the doorway of the main hall, staring blankly at the droplets dripping from the eaves. In one corner of the room, a leak had formed, the steady plink-plonk of water hitting the floor and creating a small puddle.

"Emily, why don't you take a nap? You didn’t sleep well last night," Michael Stone said with concern.

Emily Johnson blinked. She had slept perfectly fine—why would she need to rest now? Still, the rhythmic patter of rain made it hard to focus on reading.

"Alright. David, Tommy, what about you?"

"We want to play!" David grabbed his little brother’s hand, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

Emily returned to her room and lay down, but sleep eluded her. The children’s laughter from next door mingled with the sound of rain drumming against the roof. She turned toward the window, where the downpour veiled the world in a hazy mist.

Back in the 21st century, she’d never had the luxury of watching the rain—always rushing between projects or working overtime. Now, with time to spare, she noticed how beautiful the falling droplets looked.

"Each autumn rain brings deeper cold..." she murmured softly.

A memory surfaced—a picture she’d once seen in a short video: red lanterns hanging between dark-tiled roofs, a persimmon tree heavy with fruit, yet no children playing beneath it. The scene had been heartbreakingly beautiful.

City life had always been a blur of haste. Here, time moved slower.

Ethan watched as the rain eased and stood to leave. "Michael, I should head back. I’ll wash your clothes before returning them."

"Mm." Michael patted his shoulder. "If things get unbearable, just move out."

Ethan froze. Move out? He’d never considered it.

"You earn work points now—you can support yourself," Michael said earnestly. "Winter hasn’t set in yet. If you leave now, you can still forage in the mountains for food."

Ethan lowered his head, fingers twisting the hem of his shirt. He knew his sister-in-law had been itching to kick him out.

"Go see Captain John and the Party Secretary," Michael advised. "Don’t wait until they throw you out."

"Thanks, Michael." Ethan’s voice cracked slightly.

After seeing Ethan off, Michael led the boys back inside and found Emily already asleep. He pressed a finger to his lips. "Quiet now. Don’t wake your mother."

The two little ones tiptoed onto the bed and burrowed under the covers, soon drifting off as well.

Once the rain stopped, Michael took a fishing net to the riverbank, where villagers had already gathered to scoop up fish.

"Michael, you’re late!" Robert Stone waved at him. "Most of the big ones are gone."

"That’s fine. Small fish will do," Michael replied with a smile.

A familiar voice called from a distance, "Michael! Michael!"

Samuel Bright jogged over. The game Daniel River had brought yesterday had made for a fine meal, and today he hoped to try his luck too.

The river had swollen from the heavy rain, and the bank buzzed with activity. Everyone wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to bring home extra food.

"Michael..." Samuel hesitated.

Michael turned. "What is it?"

"I heard..." Samuel lowered his voice. "Inspectors are coming to the village..."

Michael’s hand stilled, his gaze sharpening. "When?"

"Within the next couple of days. Sent from above..." Samuel rubbed his hands nervously.

Laughter still filled the riverside, but Michael’s heart sank. This autumn rain seemed to have brought more than just a chill—it carried unsettling news.
###Chapter 91: Sour Duck Soup

Three shadowy figures crept through the reeds upstream.

"Shh—" Daniel River lowered his voice. "Look, wild ducks over there."

Michael Stone squinted and spotted several plump ducks foraging in the shallows. He swiftly pulled off his shirt, revealing his toned muscles.

"Let's go!"

With a splash, the three men plunged into the river, startling the ducks into frantic flight. Still, they managed to catch three.

"Feast tonight," Daniel grinned, holding up their prize.

Michael tucked over twenty wild duck eggs into his arms, his pants dripping as he stepped inside. His wife, Emily Johnson, stood in the living room with her hands on her hips.

"Went swimming?" She narrowed her eyes at his soaked trousers.

Michael swallowed hard, instinctively hiding the eggs behind his back. "Just got wet collecting these."

"Liar!" Emily grabbed his arm. "You didn’t wake me when the rain stopped?"

Water droplets glistened on his sun-kissed skin, his muscles flexing with each breath. Emily’s throat went dry—his physique put those gym posers to shame.

"You looked too peaceful sleeping," Michael murmured, his warm breath tickling her ear.

Her ears burned as she pushed him away. "Nice try. I’m going to check the river."

"Don’t bother." He pulled out a duck like a magician. "How about sour duck soup with dumplings?"

"Sauerkraut filling!" Emily’s eyes lit up. "I’ll knead the dough!"

They worked side by side in the kitchen, the rhythmic chopping startling the neighbor’s hen. Michael expertly sliced the duck breast, the blade flashing as paper-thin cuts lined the board.

Meanwhile, tension hung thick in the old house.

Patricia Stone glared at the empty stove. "Bet they’re making fish soup next door."

William Stone turned over in bed. "Save your energy. We’ve got roofing tomorrow."

"But your brother’s family—"

"Enough!" William sat up sharply. "You didn’t complain during the split. Now you covet their fish?"

Patricia flinched but still peered outside, saliva pooling as the wind carried over tantalizing smells.

At the college, Sophia Green kicked her luggage, scowling at the clearing sky. The rain had delayed his trip—and made him miss the riverside spectacle.

"Damn weather," he cursed, unaware of the storm brewing ahead.
###Chapter 92: The Threat of Michael Stone

Sophia Green stood by the window, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her shirt. The muddy path outside reminded her of Michael Stone's sinister face.

"I heard Michael beat someone again yesterday," she murmured, a cold sweat breaking out on her back.

The dormitory was eerily quiet. What was once a lively house now held only five people. Two college admission lists had taken away four of their companions.

"Sophia, are you really leaving?" Olivia Brown tugged at her sleeve, her voice trembling. "If you go, I'll be the only girl left here."

Sophia answered distractedly, "You have good grades. You'll get in next year." Her eyes remained fixed on the door, dreading the moment that terrifying figure might appear.

She had to leave. Now.

The incident with Mrs. Wang wasn't over yet. And Michael was a ticking time bomb.

"I need to go to the brigade office," she said, grabbing her coat and rushing out, mud splashing onto her pants without a second thought.

The accounting room was hazy with smoke. John Stone Sr. puffed on his pipe, eyeing her through narrowed lids.

"Captain, I'd like to settle my work points today," Sophia said, her voice shaking. "My mother is seriously ill. I need to go home immediately."

The old accountant clicked his abacus, the sound like a death knell.

"Settling now might lead to errors," he drawled. "For accuracy, we'd need another two weeks."

Two weeks? Sophia nearly cried out. In two weeks, she might already be in the infirmary!

"No, no, I'll take it as is," she insisted, snatching the pen to sign.

John Stone exhaled smoke rings, a mocking glint in his eyes. These educated youths always ran when trouble came.

"Michael invited us for fish," Mary Stone's voice suddenly rang out in the courtyard.

Richard Stone bounced excitedly, only to freeze under Mary's sharp glare. "Go find your parents."

Sophia clutched the thin stack of bills, her fingers jerking violently at the name "Michael." The money slipped from her grasp, fluttering to the muddy ground.
###Chapter 93: Disaster Strikes

"I want fish! I want fish!" Richard rolled on the ground, wailing, his face smeared with snot and tears.

Mary Stone watched coldly, making no move to comfort him.

"Get up!" John Stone Sr. barked, startling the boy. Terrified of his grandfather's temper, Richard scrambled to his feet and bolted inside.

Mary sighed. None of her daughters-in-law were easy—Elizabeth was too meek, Patricia too sharp-tongued, and Emily... well, Emily had her own way of stirring trouble.

"Time to help out," Mary muttered, glancing at the darkening sky. The autumn rain had brought an early dusk.

"Captain Stone! Trouble!" A villager rushed over in a panic. "Ethan's been beaten! He's demanding to split from his family!"

John frowned. "He nearly drowned this morning, and now this?"

"Let's go see." He turned to Mary. "Fetch the village head."

Instead of following, Mary detoured to Emily's house.

"Michael! Emergency!" Charles Clark burst in, breathless. "Ethan got beaten by his sister-in-law—he wants to leave home!"

Gasping, he added, "And she's trying to strip him of the clothes you lent him!"

Emily's rolling pin clattered onto the counter. She gaped at Michael.

Michael's face darkened. "What nonsense! Who's stripping whose clothes?"

Charles realized his blunder and scratched his head. "No—I meant—"

"Better hurry," Emily said, suppressing a laugh. "Before someone actually undresses you."

Michael groaned. "Those were clothes I lent Ethan!" He dragged Charles outside. "The way you said it made it sound like his sister-in-law has designs on me!"

The moment they left, Mary arrived.

"Where's Michael?" She peered into the kitchen.

"Just left." Emily gestured to the plump dumplings on the counter. "We caught a wild duck—made dumplings and soup. Was about to invite you both over."

Mary's heart warmed at the sight of the steaming dumplings. "Poor Ethan. Lost his parents young, and now his own kin mistreats him—"

A distant commotion cut her off. Emily and Mary exchanged uneasy glances.
###Chapter 94: Ethan's Independence

Mary Stone sighed and lowered her voice. "Ever since Ethan's parents passed, his brother and sister-in-law changed completely. That boy is still so young, yet they force him to do heavy labor every day, beating and starving him. Have you seen his hands? They don’t even look like a child’s."

Emily Johnson recalled seeing Ethan at noon—skinny as a twig, his hands covered in calluses and scars. Her heart ached. "What if he moves out? At least he wouldn’t be beaten anymore."

"It’s not that simple..." Mary shook her head.

As the two women spoke, chaos erupted at Ethan’s house.

"Everyone else caught fish, but you came back empty-handed? Think you deserve dinner? Dream on!" Ethan’s sister-in-law shrieked.

"Kneel down! No food for you tonight!"

But this time, Ethan didn’t obey. Remembering Michael Stone’s advice, he turned and ran.

"You little brat! How dare you run?" His sister-in-law grabbed a stick and chased after him. "I’ll break your legs! Don’t you dare come back!"

"Stop!" John Stone Sr. and the village elder arrived just in time to see Ethan being chased around the yard.

Ethan’s nieces and nephews stood by, watching the spectacle, while his older brother pretended not to notice.

"Drop that stick!" John barked.

Ethan’s sister-in-law froze when she saw the officials. "Captain Stone, we were just playing around..."

"The decision to split the household is ours to make," the elder said sternly.

"No! We won’t separate!" she protested, stomping her feet.

John scoffed. "It’s not up to you! Ethan, speak up!"

"I want my own home!" Ethan shouted, his eyes red. "If I stay, they’ll beat or starve me to death!"

"Ungrateful wretch!" His sister-in-law lunged forward.

"Enough!" John slammed his hand on the table. "Ethan is your brother-in-law, not your servant! This separation happens today!"

Ethan’s brother forced a smile. "Captain, he’s just a child—"

"Too late," the elder cut in coldly. "The whole village knows you’ve been treating him like livestock."

Just then, a clear voice rang out from the crowd. "I heard someone wants to strip me naked?"

People stepped aside as Michael Stone strode forward.

"Michael?" John blinked in surprise.

Michael smirked. "I came to see who’s bold enough to try undressing a man in public."
###Chapter 95: Someone They Dare Not Cross

"Was it you?"

Ethan's sister-in-law stumbled back three steps in fear. Michael Stone was notorious in the village as someone no one dared to provoke.

"What are you cowering for?" Michael narrowed his eyes, his voice icy. "You had the nerve to strip my brother, and now you're playing the coward?"

Ethan's older brother trembled, wishing he could vanish into the ground. The entire family knew better than to cross Michael Stone.

"Nonsense," Michael drawled, leaning lazily against the doorframe. "Ethan fell into the river this morning, so I gave him a change of clothes. Everyone saw how his sister-in-law yanked at his clothes earlier."

"We saw it!" someone from the crowd called out.

Michael smirked. "What, trying to claim my clothes now?"

"It wasn't me, it wasn't..." Ethan's sister-in-law stammered, her earlier bullying bravado completely gone.

"Enough. Let's settle the division first." Michael strode over and sat beside his father, his cold gaze sweeping over Ethan's brother and his family.

With Michael present, Ethan's brother's family didn't dare make another scene. John Stone Sr. and the village elder quickly mediated the division of property.

"Ethan won't live in the house, but you'll have to buy out his share," John Stone said firmly, staring at Ethan's brother. "Your parents raised you, got you married, and this is how you treat your younger brother?"

Ethan's brother hung his head and eventually paid up. Michael, along with Charles and a few others, helped Ethan move into an abandoned old house at the edge of the village. They bought it for twenty dollars. Though the roof leaked, it was at least a chance for Ethan to start anew.

"Come, eat at my place."

"Third Brother, I’d rather not," Ethan said, his eyes red. "I can cook for myself."

Michael clapped him on the shoulder. "Alright. If your sister-in-law causes trouble, just call for me."

Ethan nodded solemnly. Without Michael's support, he’d never have gotten his freedom.

"Thank you, Third Brother."

By the time Michael and John Stone returned home, dusk had fallen. Emily and Mary quickly dropped dumplings into a pot of sour duck soup.

Under the glow of the kerosene lamp, the family gathered for a lively dinner. The tangy broth and savory dumplings warmed them from the inside out.

"It's late. We should head back," John Stone said, rising.

"Be careful on the road," Mary reminded them.

Michael escorted them back to the old house with a flashlight. David and Tommy dutifully helped clear the table while Emily busied herself in the kitchen.

"Tomorrow, we’ll air out the children’s bedding," Emily said as she washed dishes. "They can’t keep sharing one bed forever."

"Mm. I’ll fix the roof while I’m at it," Michael said, glancing up at the beams. "Judging by the sky, we’re in for a wet winter."

Emily thought back to the day’s events. "Ethan really got his own place?"

"He did," Michael replied, removing his coat. "His brother paid for his share of the house. Ethan moved into that adobe place east of the village—just a few minutes from us."

"What about food rations?"

"He got his portion."

Emily dried her hands and lowered her voice. "You think his brother’s family might steal his share?"

She wasn’t being overly suspicious—some people were capable of anything.

"Don’t worry," Michael said, a glint of steel in his eyes. "Ethan’s under my protection now. They wouldn’t dare."

Emily nearly dropped a plate. Had she heard that right?

"Let’s sleep," Michael said casually, changing the subject.

By the time they finished washing up, the room was pitch black. The two boys burrowed under the covers, clinging to Emily from either side.

"I want to sleep next to Mommy!"

"Me too!"
###Chapter 96: Sophia Green Flees Overnight

"Mommy, I want to sleep next to you!" Tommy clutched his pillow and scrambled onto the big bed.

Not to be outdone, David chimed in, "Me too!"

Michael Stone stood at the doorway, gripping his own pillow, frustration simmering inside him. He had finally managed to share a room with his wife under the pretense of fixing the leaky roof, only for these two little rascals to steal his spot.

Emily Johnson held a child in each arm, secretly relieved. This was better—she wouldn’t have to get too close to that man.

At the educated youth quarters, the commotion started at dawn.

"Sophia, you heading back to the city to visit family?" The old man driving the oxcart puffed on his pipe.

Sophia Green shoved her luggage onto the cart without looking up. "Family matters. Just going to check on them."

Olivia Brown, sitting beside her, shot her a puzzled glance. Weren’t they supposed to return to the city together? Since when was this a family visit?

"Olivia, did you bring your reference letter?" Sophia suddenly asked.

"Of course," Olivia patted her chest. "Took forever to get approved."

The oxcart creaked into motion. As the village faded into the distance, Sophia smirked. The Wang family? Michael Stone? Hah. Sophia Green wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

Back at the Stone household, Emily was busy airing out the heavy quilts.

"These are so heavy," she complained, rubbing her sore wrists.

Without a word, Michael took the bedding from her. "I’ll do it."

Once the quilts were hung, Emily was panting from exertion. David, ever thoughtful, handed her an enamel cup. "Mom, drink some water."

"Thank you, sweetheart." Emily ruffled his hair, warmth blooming in her chest.

Just as Michael climbed the ladder to repair the roof, their neighbor Margaret Miller came rushing over in a flurry.

"Emily! Big trouble!" Margaret slapped her thigh for emphasis. "That Sophia Green ran off!"

"What?" Emily nearly dropped her cup.

"Someone saw her this morning hauling bags onto the oxcart!" Margaret lowered her voice. "Old Mrs. Wang is fuming at home, cursing up a storm!"

Michael, still on the roof, tightened his grip on a roof tile until it nearly cracked.

"How did she get a reference letter?" Emily frowned.

"Heard she got it from the brigade leader, said it was a family emergency." Margaret scoffed. "Excuse my language, but that’s just a coward’s way out!"

David and Tommy perked up, their big eyes darting between the adults.

Emily gazed thoughtfully toward the educated youth quarters. Well, this was about to get interesting.
###Chapter 97: Sophia Green's Sudden Departure

The patriarch of the Stone family had known about this for a while.

Just last night, he had come over for dinner, yet he hadn’t mentioned a word about Sophia Green.

Clearly, John Stone Sr., the village chief, held a deep-seated grudge against Emily.

No wonder—since marrying Michael Stone, Emily hadn’t worked a single day in the fields.

All the work points had been earned by Michael alone.

No surprise he wasn’t pleased.

"Didn’t Mrs. Wilson make a scene?" Emily lowered her voice.

Daisy Miller leaned in closer. "She fell ill after her youngest son’s accident. Otherwise, she would’ve stormed the知青院 long ago. She wanted to come here, but with your husband back, she didn’t dare."

"Oh," Daisy suddenly remembered, "your husband gave my husband a bag of candy as thanks for taking you to town."

Emily finally understood.

So the man who drove the ox-cart that day was Daisy’s husband.

No wonder he wasn’t afraid of Michael—his reputation in the village wasn’t exactly stellar.

"That’s only right," Emily smiled faintly.

After seeing Daisy off, little David immediately ran up. "Mom, is Sophia really gone?"

His eyes sparkled.

If Sophia had returned to the city, she wouldn’t keep urging Emily to leave.

And Emily wouldn’t get angry at them for stopping her.

"I’m going to read," Emily said, turning to go inside.

Up on the roof, Michael worked even faster.

"Sweetheart, I’ll cook later!"

His booming voice carried across the yard.

The neighboring women couldn’t help but gossip:

"Michael sure dotes on Emily."

"Can you blame him?"

"How many college students are left in the village?"

"Some abandoned their families just to return to the city."

"If Michael doesn’t treat Emily well, who knows when she might—"

Emily, of course, didn’t hear any of this.

She was preoccupied with lunch.

"We’re out of eggs. I’ll go get some," Michael said, dusting himself off.

Soon, he returned with over twenty eggs.

"Tomorrow, I’ll help my brothers build their houses," he said while washing his hands.

"They’ve split from the family?" Emily was surprised.

Michael nodded. "Father and Mother divided the property to stop William from complaining about favoritism."

Favoritism?

Hearts were naturally biased.

"Adobe or brick houses?"

"I’ll ask," Michael dried his hands. "If they need bricks or tiles, I can help arrange it."

After all, they were family.

Life seemed to settle back into peace.

Both Robert and William had chosen their homestead plots.

One day, Robert came by:

"Michael, we were thinking of getting some bricks and tiles..."

His eyes filled with envy as he looked at his younger brother’s brick-tile house.
###Chapter 98: Post-Division Dilemmas

"Michael, you've got to help me out here." Robert Stone rubbed his hands together, his face etched with worry as he stood before his younger brother.

Michael paused mid-swing, lowering the axe and wiping sweat from his brow. "How many rooms are you planning to build, Robert?"

"Three brick-tile houses, but the kitchen will still be adobe." Robert's voice grew quieter. "How much... how much would that cost?"

Michael did a quick mental calculation. "Brick-tile houses aren't cheap. If you and William pool resources, you might get a better deal."

Robert's eyes lit up. "I'll go talk to William right away!"

Meanwhile, William Stone sat brooding on his doorstep. Since the family division, he hadn't had a single peaceful night's sleep. The adobe house leaked whenever it rained, and the walls were already peeling.

"Dear, do you think Michael will agree?" Patricia asked anxiously.

William gritted his teeth. "He has to! Who else can get us bricks and tiles?"

The next day, the two brothers approached Michael together.

"Michael, we've come to a decision," William said, taking the lead. "We'll buy the materials together. Just give us a firm price."

Michael nodded. "Fine. But you'll need to pay a deposit first."

William's expression darkened. "A deposit?" He shot Michael a suspicious glance, wondering if his younger brother was trying to skim off the top.

"Without a deposit, why would the brickyard reserve stock for you?" Michael replied coolly.

In the end, the brothers scraped together the deposit. Michael worked fast—within three days, he had delivered the bricks and tiles, even securing rare cement.

"Michael really knows his stuff!" the villagers marveled.

But Patricia pulled William aside, whispering, "You don’t think he’s pocketing some of our money, do you?"

"Shut your mouth!" William hissed. "I checked—his prices are twenty percent lower than market rate!"

Meanwhile, Emily Johnson was busy in the kitchen. Ever since Michael started helping his brothers build their houses, all the household chores had fallen on her shoulders.

"Mom, that smells amazing!" Tommy clung to the doorframe, eyes fixed on the golden meatballs sizzling in the pan.

Emily smiled and handed him one. "Careful, it's hot."

That night, Michael returned exhausted to find his two sons already asleep in their freshly made beds.

"Emily..." He hesitated.

She folded clothes without looking up. "What is it?"

"Well..." He scratched his head. "Tommy wet the bed again today."

Emily sighed. "He’s probably overtired."

Michael’s gaze flickered. "Maybe... I should take them back to sleep with me?"

She gave him a skeptical look. "Weren’t you the one who insisted they learn independence?"

Just then, Tommy’s cries echoed from the next room. "Mommy... I'm scared..."

A faint smirk tugged at Michael’s lips before he quickly suppressed it. "See? They still need us."

Emily shook her head in resignation, completely missing the triumphant glint in her husband’s eyes.
###Chapter 99: The Wronged Little One

"Mommy, I... I wet the bed." Little Tommy's eyes were red, his small hands clutching the hem of his shirt, his voice barely above a whisper.

He distinctly remembered going to the bathroom before bed.

How could this happen?

Even little Daisy next door had stopped wetting the bed.

"Emily, take Tommy to change first. I'll handle the bedding." Michael swiftly pulled off the sheets. "This quilt will need two days in the sun to dry."

Another day of airing out the bedding?

Emily sighed inwardly.

Looks like they'd be sharing a bed again tonight.

"Go ahead," she said resignedly.

She couldn't possibly blame the child for this.

With his back turned to his wife and son, Michael's lips curled into a faint smile.

This plan had worked perfectly.

Though poor Tommy had suffered unjustly.

He'd make it up to him tomorrow with a candy apple.

The little boy had no idea he'd taken the fall for his father.

The real "culprit" was already gleefully plotting how to snuggle with his wife tonight.

"Mommy, I won't drink milk before bed anymore," Tommy sniffled.

David quickly chimed in, "Me neither!"

It must have been the milk that caused the accident.

Emily ruffled both boys' hair. "It's okay, just change your clothes."

Even after getting dressed, Tommy remained downcast.

"I'll wash the sheets—"

"No!" Michael cut her off. "You... your time of the month is here. You shouldn't touch cold water."

His ears turned pink as he spoke.

Emily froze.

How did he even remember that?

Though she was in the original host's body now, the soul was hers!

This body suffered from cramps during her period, unlike her previous life where it had been effortless.

"You should keep drinking milk. It's good for you."

"Mommy drink! Mommy needs it!" Tommy immediately insisted.

Emily chuckled. "We'll all drink together."

Suddenly, Michael brought up, "Charles is getting married."

So soon?

"We'll go to the wedding banquet," she said, curious about what a celebration from this era would look like.

After washing the sheets, Michael headed out.

"Come on, let's gather some firewood," Emily called to the boys.

They hadn't been outside in days.

Might as well pick some wild berries while they were at it.

She hadn't dared to take out any fruit while Michael was home.

Now was the perfect chance.

The two boys, wearing their rubber boots, skipped along happily.

"Mommy! That's Ethan!"

Emily followed Tommy's pointing finger.

A group of older boys were shoving Ethan around.

"Stop that!" she shouted.

The children turned and scattered at the sight of her.

Everyone knew better than to mess with Emily.

Ethan scrambled up from the ground, disheveled.

"Sis..."

"Are you hurt?" Emily's heart ached at the bruises on his face.

"Ethan, two of those boys were your nephews!" David said indignantly.

What?

Nephews beating up their uncle?

Emily understood instantly.

This was retaliation from Ethan's sister-in-law after the family split, wasn't it?
###Chapter 100: Treasure Hunt in the Wild

Ethan's eyes lit up when he saw them carrying bamboo baskets. "Are you gathering firewood?"

David nodded. "Yes, Mom's taking us to collect firewood and bamboo husks."

"Let me help!" Ethan offered eagerly.

Emily Johnson thought for a moment before agreeing. "Alright, David and Tommy, stay here with Ethan and gather firewood. I'll take a look around nearby."

"Come back soon, Mom," little Tommy said, looking up at her.

Ethan watched curiously as Emily walked away before turning to help the boys gather bamboo husks—perfect for starting fires.

Meanwhile, Emily hid nearby, quietly retrieving items from her hidden inventory.

She took out two pounds each of ground cherries, blueberries, sapodillas, wampees, and honeyed apples—choosing varieties that looked like wild fruits.

"Mom's back!" The boys cheered when they spotted her in the distance.

Ethan looked up to see Emily returning with a bamboo basket filled to the brim.

"Guess what I found?" she said with a mysterious smile.

"Wow, so many wild berries!" Tommy stood on tiptoe to peek into the basket.

Ethan scratched his head, puzzled. "There are this many wild fruits in the mountains? I've never seen them before."

"Here, try this." Emily handed him a honeyed apple.

Ethan took a big bite, and his eyes widened. "So sweet!"

"Let me pack some for you to take home," Emily said, stuffing his pockets. "Maybe they were just hidden in the grass before."

The golden ground cherries, wrapped in delicate husks, looked familiar, but Ethan had never known they were edible.

After sharing the fruits, Emily headed home with the boys while Ethan dashed excitedly into the mountains—determined to gather more food before winter.

On the way, David looked up and asked, "Mom, Ethan said he's looking for food, but there's nothing left to eat in the mountains now."

"Who says there isn't?" Emily smiled and ruffled his hair. "Kudzu root, Chinese yam, cassava—aren't those edible?"

"Tree roots aren't food!" Tommy protested immediately.

Emily crouched down and explained patiently, "Some roots are edible. Like kudzu—you dig it up, mash it, and filter it to make kudzu starch. It’s even better than flour!"

She remembered the translucent kudzu starch dumplings from her past life.

"I'll draw Ethan a map. You can give it to him tomorrow so he knows what to look for." Emily picked up a stick and sketched in the dirt.

David stared at the strange root patterns, half-doubting. "Mom… can you really eat tree roots?"

All his life, he'd only known roots as things buried underground—never as food.
###Chapter 101: Secrets in the Mountains

"Mom, can we really eat these roots?" David crouched on the ground, poking curiously at the pile of freshly dug brown roots.

Emily Johnson knelt beside him, picking one up and weighing it in her palm. "Don't judge them by their looks. There's treasure hidden inside."

Tommy wrinkled his nose as he leaned closer. "They smell bad."

"They won't smell like this once they're prepared," Emily explained with a smile. "These vine roots contain starch, just like the sweet potatoes we eat."

The boys' eyes widened in amazement. Suddenly, David remembered something. "Is this like what the book says—that everything has a use?"

"Smart boy!" Emily patted his head approvingly. "That's why reading is important. It teaches us so many interesting things. Like..."

"Like why it rains?" Tommy blurted out.

"Exactly." Emily pointed at the sky. "See those dark clouds before it rains?"

Both boys nodded eagerly, their heads bobbing like little chicks pecking at grain.

Back home, Emily brought out a plate of freshly washed fruit—bright red apples and golden pears that made the children's mouths water.

"Save some for Dad," David said thoughtfully.

Emily's hand paused. The origin of these fruits wasn't easy to explain. "Don't worry, I've set aside something special for your father."

She quietly placed a few wild berries on the windowsill. These were common in the village and wouldn't raise suspicion.

"So sweet!" Tommy took a bite of an apple, his eyes closing in delight.

Just as they were eating, the courtyard gate creaked open. Michael Stone walked in, dust-covered and sweating.

"Dad!" The boys rushed toward him, holding out their fruit.

Michael froze. "Where did you get this?"

"Mom found them in the mountains!" Tommy announced proudly.

His expression darkened instantly. In three quick strides, he was in front of Emily. "You went into the mountains?" His voice carried a note of fear. "It's dangerous this season—wild boars are foraging..."

Emily quickly reassured him. "I only went near the foothills, not deep inside."

Michael's frown remained. He picked up one of the wild berries from the windowsill and took a bite. The sweet-tart juice burst in his mouth.

"Good, right?" David asked expectantly.

"Yeah." Michael's expression softened as he ruffled his son's hair. "Your mom picked them, so of course they're good."

Emily changed the subject. "How much longer until your brothers' house is finished? I need to go to town tomorrow to buy a few things."

"At least ten more days." Michael wiped his brow. "What do you need? I can get it for you."

Emily hesitated. "Just... women's things." She couldn't exactly say she wanted to buy meat for a feast.

"Then I'll take you on the bicycle," Michael said firmly. "The town isn't safe lately."

Emily groaned inwardly. How was she supposed to secretly stock up in her space now?
###Chapter 102: The Stingy Husband's Generosity

"Emily, I boiled an egg for you today," Michael Stone said carefully as he placed the peeled egg into her bowl.

Emily Johnson looked at the farm-fresh egg in her bowl, then glanced at her husband's nearly worn-out cloth shoes. Her heart ached. This man was so frugal with himself, yet he always found ways to give her extra food.

"I want to go to town," she suddenly announced.

Michael's hand trembled, nearly dropping his chopsticks. "W-What for?"

"To buy you a pair of rubber shoes," Emily said, staring at his feet. "Yours are about to show your toes."

"My shoes are fine!" Michael quickly pulled his feet back. "Save the money to buy meat for you."

Little Tommy blinked and asked, "Daddy, why do your shoes talk? Mommy said they're about to 'show your toes.'"

David immediately covered his brother's mouth and dragged him outside. Mom and Dad were about to argue again. Ever since Sophia Green left, Mom had been acting strange.

The room fell silent.

"Are you afraid I'll run away?" Emily asked bluntly.

Michael broke into a sweat. "I'm just worried it's not safe for you to go to town alone!"

"Then what are you really afraid of?" Emily took a step closer. "Afraid I have a lover in town?"

"Nonsense!" Michael shot to his feet, his tall frame looming over her. "Who in this whole countryside could compare to me?"

Emily was stunned by his sudden intensity. It was true—this man might be poor, but he gave her his all. Too bad in the original story, she was just the villainess...

"Michael," she suddenly asked, "if I really ran away, would you chase me?"

The man was silent for a long moment before answering hoarsely, "I'd hunt you down to the ends of the earth."

Emily's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly changed the subject. "Tomorrow, I'll buy some yarn to knit sweaters for the kids."

"What about me?" Michael looked at her like a child begging for candy.

Her cheeks warmed under his gaze. "If... if there's extra yarn, I'll make one for you too."

"Let's just buy ready-made ones," Michael suddenly took her hand. "Knitting is too tiring. I don’t want you to strain yourself."

His rough hand enveloped her slender fingers, and Emily suddenly thought—maybe staying here wouldn’t be so bad after all.
###Chapter 103: A Man's Little Thoughts

"Sweetheart, why are your hands so cold?"

Without waiting for a reply, Michael Stone enveloped Emily Johnson's slender fingers in his large, rough hands, his calloused thumbs gently stroking the back of her hand. A tingling warmth spread from her fingertips straight to her heart.

Memories of last night surfaced in her mind. Though half-asleep, she had clearly felt the press of a warm kiss on her forehead. And those strong arms—reaching past their sleeping children to pull her close.

Let go, she thought silently. But the man seemed oblivious, tightening his grip instead.

"Once Robert’s house is finished, we’ll go into town," Michael said, his eyes crinkling with a smile. "We’ll get you, David, and Tommy new winter coats."

Emily suppressed a scoff. What can’t I find online? Why bother with town?

She tried to tug her hand free—no luck.

"Are we taking the kids?" she asked pointedly.

"No," Michael said firmly. "The ride’s too rough. Mom can watch them."

Emily rolled her eyes. What a devoted father.

Meanwhile, Michael was lost in the softness of her hand. How is her skin so smooth? Like cotton. And that faint, sweet scent—he couldn’t bring himself to let go.

"I should get to work," he said reluctantly, finally releasing her. "Robert will be waiting."

At last, he was gone. Emily exhaled, looking down at her slightly reddened hand. His palm was broad and strong, the calluses from years of labor leaving her skin warm.

Strangely… she didn’t mind it.

Elsewhere, David and Tommy bounded over to Ethan Miller’s house.

"Ethan!" Tommy called in his tiny voice. "Mommy says there are roots in the mountains we can eat!"

Ethan, sorting through the cellar’s food stores, looked up in surprise. "Edible roots?"

"Like flour!" David gestured excitedly. "She said she’d draw them for you!"

Ethan hesitated. Growing up in the village, he’d never heard of such a thing. But then again, Emily had taught them about wild berries before…

"Let’s go ask her."

The three children dashed back to the Stone house.

"Mommy!" Tommy shouted as soon as they entered. "Ethan’s here!"

Emily, basking in the sunlight in the yard, smiled and waved them over.

Ever since Michael’s return, she hadn’t even bothered locking the gate. With him around, who’d dare steal anything?

"Emily," Ethan said sheepishly, "David mentioned you know about edible roots…"

"I’ll draw them for you."

She stood and headed inside, the children trailing behind like eager ducklings.

"Wait in the living room," she said gently. "I’ll be quick."

Unfolding paper, she carefully sketched—kudzu vines, Chinese yam leaves, cassava plants—each line precise and clear.

"Ethan, look." She pointed at the drawings. "Kudzu needs to be processed into flour, yams can be boiled straight, and cassava…" She paused. "Might not grow in our mountains."

Ethan clutched the paper like treasure, eyes shining. "Thank you! I’ll go search right away!"

Emily smiled, ruffling his hair. "Be careful."

Watching the children scamper off, she suddenly thought—this kind of life… isn’t so bad after all.
###Chapter 104: Treasure Hunt in the Wild

Ethan Miller stared at the crumpled papers in his hand, the leaf shapes drawn on them looking oddly familiar. Wasn't this just the common wild vine growing in the back hills?

"Got a knife?" he asked, scratching his head.

"Brought one when I moved out." Ethan patted the hatchet tucked at his waist.

Emily Johnson handed him the sketches. "Be careful in the mountains. If you run into a wild boar, climb a tree."

"Got it." Ethan grinned sheepishly, carefully folding the papers and tucking them into his shirt.

As soon as he got home, he grabbed a bamboo basket and hurried to the back hills. The kudzu vines grew thick and tangled, and it took him a while to find the main root. Digging deeper, he uncovered a thick, gnarled tuber. His eyes lit up, and he worked faster.

By sunset, he descended the hill with a basket full of kudzu roots. Picking the thickest one, he headed straight to Michael Stone's house.

"Emily, you home?" Ethan called from outside the gate.

The clatter of dishes sounded from inside, followed by Emily's voice: "Door's open. Come in."

Ethan pushed the gate open to find the family of four at dinner. He hesitated awkwardly at the doorstep.

"Michael... Emily..." He rubbed his hands nervously.

Emily spotted the kudzu root in his hand immediately and set down her chopsticks. "Perfect timing. Eat first, then we'll talk."

Little Tommy had already dashed to the kitchen to fetch an extra bowl.

"About this kudzu root..." Emily explained between bites. "Peel it, slice it, mash it, then strain it through cheesecloth. Let it settle overnight..."

Michael looked baffled. "You can actually eat this root?"

"Not just eat it—it can be a staple food." Emily smiled. "Once Ethan processes it, we can trade for some."

Ethan waved his hands hastily. "No need to trade. I'll bring you some."

"There are medicinal herbs in the mountains too," Emily suddenly remembered. "Too bad I don't know them all. You go up there often—could be a good side income."

Ethan froze. He'd grown up roaming these hills, but to him, plants were just plants. How could he tell which were herbs and which were weeds?

"Just having food is enough," he said with a simple smile.

Just then, a voice called from outside: "Emily, time to go!"

Emily quickly finished her last few bites and turned to the children. "If you're hungry, there's powdered milk and biscuits in the cupboard."

Slinging her bamboo basket over her shoulder, she headed out, mentally listing winter clothes for the kids—thermal underwear, sweaters, padded jackets... She needed to get everything.


###Chapter 105: Letters and Yarn

"Sister-in-law, do you know how to knit sweaters?" Emily Johnson suddenly asked.

The younger sister-in-law blinked in surprise. "A little. My elder sister-in-law gave me some old gloves I can unravel for yarn. Want to make something for David and Tommy?"

"Yes, it's getting chilly." Emily tightened her collar against the autumn breeze.

They walked side by side down the village path when several aunties heading to market greeted them.

"Miss Johnson, going to town too?"

Emily nodded. "Checking if my parents' package arrived, and buying some supplies. Winter's coming fast."

The women exchanged envious glances. Even after years of marriage, her family still cared so much.

The oxcart creaked into motion, charging five cents per ride. Some villagers preferred walking to save the round-trip dime.

Meanwhile, David held little Tommy's hand, pockets stuffed with White Rabbit candies and sandwich cookies, locking their door before heading to Grandma's house.

"Grace! Jack!" David called from afar.

The cousins hadn't visited Uncle's house in weeks. Grandma said Auntie needed quiet time for reading.

"Grandma!" Tommy barreled into Mary Stone's arms.

David dutifully distributed sweets to each child.

"Where's your mother?" Mary ruffled her grandson's hair.

"She went to town for yarn..." Mary mentally calculated - good yarn required both cash and ration coupons.

"...and cookies!" Tommy proudly produced the sandwich cookies.

After snack time, the children played in the yard. Grace and Jack followed David everywhere like ducklings.

"Don't wander far. Run home if anyone bothers you," Mary cautioned. With both sons building new homes, she barely had time to breathe, and now her youngest grandson could already run around.

"Henry, where are you off to?"
"Cutting pig grass!"

The oxcart finally reached town. Emily rubbed her sore backside - the bumpy ride left her whole body aching.

"Let's check the Supply & Market first," Emily suggested. She needed to study local fabrics to avoid suspicion when using her PennyDeals purchases.

"Alright."

The market swarmed with people. Post-harvest season brought crowds, forming endless queues.

"So many?" Emily gasped.

Her sister-in-law remained unfazed. "Hurry and queue, or everything will sell out."

"You go ahead. I'll check the post office."

"Don't be long."

Emily knew her host's parents weren't truly doting. Still, she played her role, inquiring at the post office.

No package, but a letter arrived.

Another letter? Emily's fingers trembled around the envelope. The last one brought trouble - what fresh problems did this contain?

She slipped into an alley, pretending to browse the black market. Emerging later with yarn, a vest, and handmade-looking winter clothes for the children.

"There you are! Get your package?" her sister-in-law asked.

Emily cleared her throat. "Yes. Wait here while I grab a few things."

"Hurry back."

Inside the packed market, scarce goods had already sold out. But Emily now understood local pricing - her earlier purchases wouldn't raise eyebrows.

After grabbing some non-rationed daily items, Emily paid quickly.

"Let's catch the return cart."
###Chapter 106: The Hidden Message in the Letter

"Sister-in-law, want some soap?" Emily Johnson whispered, leaning closer to the young woman beside her. "Fresh stock at the Supply & Market. No coupons needed."

Soap?

The young woman's eyes instantly lit up. These days, soap was a rare commodity, and she'd never managed to get any during her trips to town.

"Yes, of course!" she nodded eagerly.

Emily smiled faintly. "Come by my place later."

Aunt Zhang, sharp-eyed as ever, noticed the bulging basket on Emily's back and reached to lift the cover. "What goodies did you get, Emily?"

Snap!

Emily caught her wrist with just enough pressure to stop her. "Auntie, I don’t like people touching my things."

Aunt Zhang withdrew her hand awkwardly but couldn’t resist commenting, "More gifts from your family, eh?"

"Yes," Emily replied coolly. "My parents worry and sent some food and supplies."

The other women on the oxcart exchanged glances. Again? So soon?

Once off the cart, Emily hurried home. The young woman called after her, "I’ll come by soon!"

Pushing open the gate, Emily locked the door behind her. From her hidden space, she laid out the items on the bed—two sets of navy-blue thermal underwear in cotton fabric, three hand-sewn cotton-padded jackets with tight stitching, and two pairs of thick-soled cotton shoes.

"Better keep it simple in this era," she murmured to herself, then retrieved two pounds of yak meat, several cans of fruit, White Rabbit Candy, and peach shortbread.

Finally, she pulled out the letter. The envelope was already opened, the paper slightly yellowed.

[My dear Emily: I hope this finds you well.]

[Lately, I’ve been unable to sleep, thinking of you suffering in the countryside. My heart aches. Policies are loosening now—return to the city immediately to prepare for college.]

Emily frowned. The original host had failed the college entrance exam twice. Why the sudden urgency?

She read on:

[Your father’s old illness has flared up. He calls your name every day.]

[Sending you away was never our choice. We’ve regretted it every moment since.]

The handwriting grew frantic:

[Reply as soon as possible. The whole family awaits your return.]

A suspicious damp stain marked the bottom right corner, as if from tears. Emily traced it with her finger and let out a cold laugh.

"Nice performance," she muttered, folding the letter. "Too bad the original girl you ruined is already dead."

Footsteps approached outside.

"Emily, I’m here for the soap!" the young woman’s voice called.

Emily quickly tucked the letter under her pillow and grabbed the prepared soap. Sunlight glinted off the pale yellow bar, its faint jasmine scent drifting in the air.

"Here. Keep it hidden," she whispered. "Don’t let anyone see."

The young woman cradled it like treasure, tucking it into her clothes. Before she could thank her, Emily’s expression suddenly shifted.

"What’s wrong?"

Emily narrowed her eyes at the dust rising in the distance. "Someone’s coming."


###Chapter 107: The Osmanthus-Scented Deal

Knock, knock, knock—

The sound at the door pulled Emily Johnson from her thoughts. She quickly tucked the letter into the drawer and picked up the osmanthus-scented soap from the table.

"Try this, sister-in-law," Emily said, handing it over. The delicate fragrance of osmanthus bloomed between them.

"Oh, this is lovely!" The young woman's eyes lit up as she rubbed the soap between her fingers. "Much nicer than the plain ones at the Supply & Market."

Emily smiled faintly. "I made it myself, so it's cheaper. Just two dollars a bar."

"Two dollars?" The woman's eyes widened. "That's... that's too cheap! The unscented ones at the market cost two-fifty!"

"We're neighbors," Emily said softly. "Besides, the packaging isn't professional..."

After a moment's hesitation, the woman pulled out two crumpled bills. "Well... I won't say no, then."

The deal was done. As she left, the woman called back, "Emily, if you ever need help knitting sweaters, just ask!"

Once alone, Emily hurried to tidy up the wrapping materials. Before she could finish, the sound of children's laughter filled the yard.

"Mom! We're home!" David Stone burst in, cheeks flushed, with his siblings close behind.

Grace held little Jack's hand, lingering shyly at the back. "Auntie..."

"Hungry?" Emily took out peach shortbread from the cupboard. "Here, one for each of you."

Four pairs of eyes sparkled. Grace cradled hers carefully, nibbling as if afraid to drop a single crumb.

"Mom, what is this? It's so good!" Tommy's mouth was full of crumbs.

"Peach shortbread," Emily said, wiping their faces. "Oh, and I bought you new clothes too."

She brought out two brand-new cotton vests. Grace and Jack stared in awe—they had never worn anything so new.

"Try them on," Emily helped them into the vests. "I'm no good at sewing, so I had to buy them ready-made."

David spun around excitedly. "So warm! Look, Mom!"

Tommy bounced after him, the hem of his vest flapping. Grace touched her new clothes, her eyes suddenly glistening.

"What's wrong, Grace?" Emily knelt beside her.

"Auntie..." Grace sniffled. "Is... is this really for me?"

Emily's heart ached. She pulled the girl into a gentle hug. "Of course it is. I'll buy you more new clothes later, okay?"

Outside, the sunset bathed the yard in golden light. Four children in new vests played and laughed, their joy carrying far into the evening.
###Chapter 108 The Allure of New Clothes

"Mom, do I look good in this?" Tommy twirled in front of Emily, his new blue coat shimmering under the sunlight.

Grace and Jack lingered by the door, their eyes fixed on David and Tommy’s new outfits. Grace absentmindedly touched the frayed patches on her sleeves, while Jack stared longingly at the glossy rubber boots.

"You look wonderful, sweetheart. Everything suits you." Emily knelt to adjust Tommy’s collar. Over the past month, the boys had visibly thrived—their cheeks had filled out, they’d grown taller, and even their skin had gained a healthy glow.

Grace swallowed hard. "Aunt Emily, those clothes are so pretty."

Emily turned to the two wistful children, her heart aching. She pulled a few red ribbons from her pocket. "Grace, share these with your sisters."

"Thank you, Aunt Emily!" Grace accepted the ribbons as if they were treasure, handling them with care. Jack watched silently, too shy to ask for anything.

After the children left, David suddenly spoke up. "Mom, can we give our old clothes to Grace and her sisters?"

Emily paused. The suggestion was unexpected yet utterly fitting. She ruffled his hair. "That’s very kind of you. I’ll wash them first, then we’ll send them over."

"Mom, does Dad give you enough money?" Tommy tilted his head. "You bought so many new things."

Emily chuckled. "That’s why we need him to work harder." She lowered her voice playfully. "I spent every penny he gave me!"

"Dad should take care of Mom!" the boys declared in unison, making her laugh.

As she folded the new clothes, Emily’s thoughts drifted. It was 1978, and the winds of reform had begun to blow. She considered starting a small business—perhaps dealing in watches.

"Brother, this coat is so warm!" Tommy buried his face in the new cotton jacket.

David neatly stacked the clothes. "We won’t be cold this winter." He glanced at the door and whispered, "We can give our old coats to Grace."

The boys exchanged conspiratorial grins, as if sharing a secret.

Emily stood by the window, gazing at the distant hills. In these times, even a single new garment was a luxury for most children. She silently vowed to improve their family’s circumstances.

"Mom!" Tommy suddenly dashed over and hugged her leg. "When I grow up, I’ll buy you lots and lots of new clothes!"

Warmth flooded Emily’s chest as she scooped him into her arms. In this era of scarcity, such pure-hearted affection was more precious than anything.
###Chapter 109: A Little Stir

"Why didn't Mom buy new clothes for herself?" David tilted his head, suddenly noticing the question.

Tommy blinked his big eyes and piped up in his baby voice, "Let Dad take her shopping!" The little boy said it matter-of-factly, as if it were the most obvious solution.

In their young memories, their father often bought gifts to make their mother happy.

"We'll tell Dad when he gets home," David nodded seriously.

Though still small, the two boys had witnessed countless moments of their father doting on their mother. To them, this conversation was perfectly natural.

In the kitchen, Emily was busy kneading dough. Her grandmother had been from the north, and growing up under her influence, Emily had developed a knack for making dough-based dishes. On the cutting board, the seasoned meat filling gave off an enticing aroma.

"David, go pick some scallions from the garden," Emily called out toward the yard.

"Coming!" David answered brightly, grabbing his little brother’s hand as they dashed toward the vegetable patch. Their small figures bounced along like two happy rabbits.

Meanwhile, Michael was helping his eldest brother build a house.

"Third Brother, I heard Sister-in-law went to town today?" Daniel River asked as he carried bricks. The last time Emily had gone to town, rumors had spread that she had abandoned her children, causing quite a stir.

Michael didn’t pause in his work. "She went to buy a few things. Why, are you curious?"

"If Sister-in-law went to town, why didn’t you go with her?" Daniel lowered his voice. "The house construction can wait a little while."

Just then, Grace came skipping over, a brand-new red hair ribbon tied around her wrist. "Mom, look! Auntie gave this to me!"

Elizabeth Stone patted her daughter’s head. "Did you thank her?"

"I did! Big Sis and Second Sis got one too!" Grace lifted her chin proudly.

Nearby, Jack pouted. "I didn’t get anything..."

"You’re a boy. What do you need a hair ribbon for?" Grace retorted. "Do you see David or Tommy wearing one?"

Hearing this, Michael’s lips curled slightly. So his wife was already back—and had brought gifts for the children.

"Sister-in-law returned so soon?" Daniel said in surprise.

Michael didn’t respond, but his movements became noticeably quicker. As soon as work ended, he hurried home.

The moment he stepped into the yard, the rich scent of food wafted from the kitchen. The boys’ voices rose and fell in excitement:

"Mom, is it ready yet?"
"It smells so good..."

"Just a little longer. They’re best when golden brown," Emily’s gentle voice carried a hint of laughter.

Michael stood at the doorway, watching her bustling figure by the stove, warmth swelling in his chest. The sizzling meat pies in the pan filled the air with their delicious aroma—this was the true taste of home.
###Chapter 110: That Beef is Worth Its Weight in Gold

Michael Stone had barely stepped into the yard when the rich aroma of meat greeted him. He quickened his pace toward the kitchen and peered through the window to see his wife, Emily, bustling around the stove, with their two little shadows—David and Tommy—clinging close behind her. Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting a warm glow over the scene.

"Emily’s been looking much livelier lately," Michael thought to himself. Ever since she started using vanishing cream, her skin had taken on a rosy glow, and she carried a faint, pleasant fragrance.

"Dad’s home!" David, ever the sharp-eyed one, spotted him first.

Emily turned at the sound and found her tall husband already standing before her.

"Did you eat lunch?" she asked casually.

"Had some at Elizabeth’s," Michael replied, stepping closer to the stove. "Making pancakes?"

"Mhm. Got lucky today—managed to buy some beef," Emily said, flipping the patties in the pan with a spatula. "Decided to make beef patties for a treat."

Michael’s eyes lit up. Beef was a rarity—livestock in the production team were practically sacred. Unless an animal was too old to work or severely injured, no one would dream of slaughtering it.

"Cost a pretty penny today," Emily remarked pointedly. "Used up all the money and coupons you gave me."

She watched his reaction carefully. It hadn’t been a small sum.

"Don’t worry, I’ve got more," Michael said easily. Wasn’t a man supposed to provide for his wife and kids?

"Want a taste?" Emily handed him a freshly cooked patty.

"Absolutely!"

The three of them each poured themselves a bowl of powdered milk and dug into the steaming beef patties.

"Slow down, it’s hot," Emily warned the boys.

David and Tommy took their first bites, and their eyes instantly sparkled. The golden crust gave way to tender, fragrant beef that filled their noses with its savory scent.

"Your cooking is the best in the world," Michael said between bites.

Emily rolled her eyes. "Oh, please. You’re the better cook." Especially when it came to dumpling wrappers—his were perfectly elastic, a skill she could never quite master.

"David, Tommy," she teased, "who makes better food—Mom or Dad?"

"Mom!" the boys chorused without hesitation.

Emily laughed. These three—big and small—were all sweet-talkers.

"Eat up," she said, taking a bite herself. It really was delicious. Must’ve inherited Grandma’s knack for dough.

"Mom, you rest—we’ll clean up," the boys insisted as soon as they finished eating.

Once the kids had scampered off to the kitchen, Emily pulled out a new pair of rubber boots from the house. "Try these on. If they don’t fit, I’ll exchange them."

Michael caught her hand, amusement dancing in his eyes. "If my wife bought them, they’ll fit even if they don’t."

"Stop joking and try them!" Emily pulled her hand back, cheeks warming.

Michael measured the size against his foot. "Perfect fit. Thanks, sweetheart."

Emily opened her mouth but didn’t correct the endearment. After all, she was his wife now—it was only natural.

"Oh, I bought new vests for the kids," she said, changing the subject. "Seems like people are starting to do small trades on the side—I saw someone selling goods from a basket today."
###Chapter 111 Knitting Lessons?

The marketplace was operating so openly now?

Emily Johnson had been staying home recently, completely unaware of the changes outside.

"Nobody's enforcing the restrictions anymore, so the black market isn't being monitored," Michael Stone explained.

"I bought so many things!" Emily's eyes sparkled. "If I'd had more money, I would've emptied that vendor's entire basket!"

"What did you get?"

"Winter clothes and shoes for the kids, some soap..." She paused suddenly. "Actually, do you know how to knit?"

Michael blinked at the abrupt subject change.

"I don't, but Mother does. Maybe you could ask her?"

"You don't know how?" Emily seemed genuinely surprised.

In her eyes, this man could do practically anything.

Under her gaze, Michael shifted uncomfortably before inspiration struck. "Maybe... I could learn?"

"You? Learning to knit?" Emily nearly laughed aloud. "No thanks, I don't need the whole village gossiping about us."

The last thing she wanted was rumors about "the Stone wife mistreating her husband" circulating tomorrow.

"I'll try it myself first. If it doesn't work out, I'll just buy ready-made ones in town," Emily planned aloud.

Michael nodded. Winter sweaters were indeed necessary for warmth.

"Call me by my name," Emily said suddenly.

"But you are my wife," Michael replied matter-of-factly.

Emily considered something else. "How old are you?"

"Twenty-five. Why?"

Twenty-five? Younger than her? Emily's pulse quickened slightly.

"Has your birthday passed already?" She wondered about getting him a gift.

"Yes, yes," Michael answered quickly, then changed the subject. "Did your parents send you anything?"

Emily decided to test the waters. "They wrote asking me to return to the city."

"Return?" Michael's chest tightened.

Every letter from her family in previous years had caused emotional turmoil. Now with her memory loss...

"They want me to go back for studies," Emily observed his reaction carefully.

Michael's brow furrowed. The situation was likely more complicated than that.

"So... will you go?" His voice held tension.

"No." Emily's answer was firm. "I don't remember anything now. To them, I'd just be a stranger. Who knows what schemes they might have."

The letter had been full of inconsistencies. Having taken over this identity, she needed to understand the full situation first.
###Chapter 112 Michael's Resolve

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting a warm glow over the pair. Emily Johnson kept her gaze locked on Michael Stone's eyes, her fingertips still lingering on his chin.

"More familiar?" Michael's Adam's apple bobbed as his voice tightened.

"What, scared?" Emily's lips curled slightly, her eyes glinting with challenge.

Without warning, Michael seized her wrist and pulled her into his arms. Emily stumbled, landing abruptly on his lap, her nose bumping against his firm chest.

"You—"

"Didn't you say we should get more familiar?" Michael chuckled, his warm breath brushing her ear. "I'm just cooperating."

Her ears burned, and she squirmed to escape, but his grip held firm.

"Let go!"

"No." His arms tightened. "Why would I waste this chance?"

The clatter of dishes echoed from the kitchen—David was cleaning up. Emily tensed. "The kids are coming out!"

Michael didn’t budge. "They know better than to interrupt."

She glared. "You—"

"Emily," he said suddenly, serious. "Do you really want me to take the college entrance exam?"

The abrupt shift caught her off guard.

"If I go to school, what happens to the family?" He squeezed her hand. "I can’t leave you alone with two kids."

Emily pressed her lips together. She knew the practical concerns, but—

"I can handle—"

"I know you’re capable," Michael cut in, "but I don’t want you to struggle."

Sunlight dappled his face, and for the first time, she noticed the faint lines at the corners of his eyes. This man, barely in his twenties, had already shouldered too much.

"We’ll talk later." She turned away. "There’s still time."

Michael smiled. "Alright. Whatever you say."

"Stop calling me that!"

"Then what? Emily?" He leaned closer. "Or... wife?"

She shoved him away. "Whatever!"

Scrambling to her feet, she heard his low laughter behind her. That infuriating man was clearly teasing her!

"Mommy!" Tommy rubbed his eyes as he shuffled out from the bedroom. "I can’t sleep..."

Emily seized the escape. "I’ll stay with you."

Michael watched her retreat, his gaze soft. He wanted nothing more than to attend college with her—but reality left no room for selfishness.

"Daddy too!" Tommy called over his shoulder.

Michael arched a brow at Emily’s frozen figure. "Sure. Daddy’s coming too."

Emily: "..."

This afternoon was going to be anything but peaceful.
###Chapter 113: The Ultimate Betrayal

Michael Stone froze at her sudden movement.

Her slender fingers lifted his chin, bringing her close enough for him to catch the faint scent of her perfume.

"Wife?" His Adam's apple bobbed, voice rough.

Ever since her memory loss, an invisible barrier had stood between them. Now, her proximity made his heart pound like thunder.

Emily Johnson stared into his deep eyes, filled with emotions she couldn't decipher. Suddenly breathless, she hastily withdrew her hand.

"I... am not the same Emily anymore." She turned away, her voice barely audible.

The lingering warmth on her fingertips unsettled her.

Michael longed to embrace her, but glanced down at his dust-covered work clothes. Instead, he gripped her hand tightly—so hard it made her wince slightly.

"I know," he said lowly. "But you're still my wife. Still David and Tommy's mother."

Emily's fingers trembled.

"What if... I never remember?"

Without warning, Michael bent down and pressed a soft kiss to the back of her hand. The warmth sent a shiver through her.

"Then we start over." His eyes burned with determination.

Yet Emily recalled the original story's fate for the female antagonist—stealing money and fleeing, nearly causing the children's deaths. A chill ran down her spine.

"Cold?" Michael tensed instantly.

She took a deep breath and met his gaze squarely. "What do you hate most?"

The air turned to ice.

Michael's expression darkened, his jaw tightening. "Betrayal."

The word stabbed Emily's heart like an icicle. Now she understood why the male lead in the original story had shown no mercy.

"Scared?" His voice softened as he noticed her shaking.

Emily forced composure. "Why... did we get married in the first place?"


###Chapter 114: The Truth About Love at First Sight

The day the rural assignment notice arrived at the Johnson household, Emily Johnson wept bitterly. She clung to her mother’s wrist, pleading, "Mom, I don’t want to go!"

Mrs. Fan wiped her daughter’s tears but gently pried her fingers loose. "Sweetheart, this is just how things are now..."

Her suitcase was packed with brand-new polyester blouses and vanishing cream, but Emily’s heart was filled with resentment. By the time she stood at the entrance of the youth camp, mud splattered her skirt, making her look like a distressed canary.

"Well, well, the city princess has arrived," sneered Sophia Green, a fellow educated youth, eyeing Emily’s delicate complexion. "With skin that soft, how many work points do you think you’ll earn?"

The male youths, however, rushed to carry her luggage. As Emily lowered her lashes to thank them, she didn’t notice Michael Stone’s intense gaze fixed on her from the distant field ridge—where he had been watching her for three straight days.

"Let me help." On their fifth "chance" encounter, Michael took the water bucket from her hands without waiting for a reply. Emily looked up at him. Sweat glistened on his sun-bronzed skin, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed.

"Marry me, and you won’t have to work the fields," he said under the sunset. For a moment, Emily thought she saw starlight flickering in his eyes.

On their wedding night, she realized she’d been deceived. Michael wasn’t the production team accountant—just an ordinary laborer. Yet he pressed her against the bed, his breath hot against her skin. "I keep my word. Tomorrow, I’ll talk to the team leader about reassignment."

In the kitchen, Elizabeth Stone banged pots loudly. "Since when do wives act so high and mighty?" William’s wife, Patricia, added with a sneer, "A hen that doesn’t lay eggs still thinks she’s a phoenix!"

The day they divided the family property, Emily was sick to her stomach. Mary Stone took her pulse and suddenly beamed. "Emily, dear, you’re pregnant!"

Michael built a thatched cottage overnight. Watching his sturdy silhouette gilded by moonlight, Emily suddenly thought maybe the countryside wasn’t so bad after all.

"So..." Emily now pinched his earlobe. "You planned this from the start?"

Michael pulled her closer, nuzzling the faint osmanthus scent in her hair. "The moment I saw you standing at the village entrance with your suitcase, I’d already picked out names for our grandchildren."

"Silver-tongued devil!"
"Every word true."
"Love at first sight?"
"I couldn’t help myself."

Emily suddenly pushed him away as if waking from a dream. Something was wrong. She was supposed to return to the city for college entrance exams—why was she dwelling on these old memories? Outside, the cicadas’ shrill cries grew piercing. She didn’t see the shadow flicker in Michael’s eyes.

Twirling a loose strand of her hair, he thought to himself: This time, no matter what, I won’t let her fly away.
###Chapter 115: Can't Bear to See You Tired

The autumn sunlight streamed through the window as Emily Johnson gazed at the tall man before her, his strong hand gripping hers tightly.

"It's time to get to work," she reminded him softly, her pulse quickening at the warmth of his touch.

Michael Stone's deep eyes brimmed with tenderness, making her cheeks flush. How does he keep getting more handsome? she thought to herself.

"Sweetheart..." His low voice carried a hint of playful pleading.

"Go!" She feigned sternness, glaring at him, unaware how endearing she looked.

Suddenly, Michael leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to the back of her hand. The warmth of his lips sent a shiver through her.

"You—!" She yanked her hand away, flustered.

The man grinned like a fox who'd gotten his way. "I'm off. I'll cook for you tonight."

"Who asked you to cook..." she muttered under her breath, but he had already turned away.

"Oh, and," his expression turned serious, "don't even think about helping out. Stay home and study."

Emily raised an eyebrow. "I—"

"No." His tone was firm. "Building is dirty, exhausting work. I can't bear to see you tired."

The bluntness of his words made her ears burn.

Michael walked away, glancing back every few steps as if they were parting for good.

"Just go already!" She finally burst out laughing.

Only after the gate closed behind him did Emily exhale deeply. That man... he's getting too good at this.

She tiptoed to the children's room and pushed the door open.

"Mommy!" Two little bundles wriggled out from under the covers, their eyes bright.

"Can't sleep?" she asked softly.

"Nope!" Tommy nodded vigorously. "Wanna play outside!"

Emily helped them into their new vests. "It's chilly—don't go too far."

The boys cheered and dashed out, their excited chatter soon filling the yard.

"David, your new clothes are so cool!"

"My mom bought them!" David's proud voice rang out.

Emily was about to head back inside when a shrill child's voice cut through the air:

"Your mom's a city girl. She'll go back one day and leave you behind!"

Her heart clenched.

"That's not true!" David's voice trembled. "Mommy would never leave us!"

"Yeah!" Tommy chimed in. "Daddy said she'll take us with her!"

The other child persisted. "She won't even want your daddy!"

Emily's fists tightened, her nails digging into her palms. Who taught these kids to say such things?
###Chapter 116: The Little Schemer's First Lesson

"David, he called us names!" Tommy's face flushed crimson with anger, tiny fists clenched as he prepared to charge forward.

David grabbed his little brother's collar, a sly grin curling his lips. "Mom made meat pies for lunch today."

"Meat pies?" The surrounding children immediately perked up, eyes gleaming.

Tommy instantly caught on, puffing out his chest with childish pride. "They're super yummy! And Mom left a big piece of meat in the kitchen!"

"Tommy!" David feigned annoyance, glaring at him. "We agreed not to tell anyone!"

The little boy clapped both hands over his mouth, blinking wide innocent eyes—a look so disarming it could melt hearts.

"Our grandma sent us lots of special treats that none of you have," David added leisurely, twisting the knife. "Plus new clothes. Really nice ones."

The children exchanged glances, envy plain in their eyes.

"Come on, Tommy. Let's play over there." David tugged his brother away, but not before casting a deliberate glance at the name-calling boy.

Within moments, David pulled several cookies from his pocket, distributing them to the trailing group.

Crunch—

"So crispy!"

"Delicious!"

Amidst the chorus of admiration, the ostracized boy finally cracked. With a loud wail, he turned and ran off crying.

David narrowed his eyes, smirking like a fox who'd stolen the cream.

They used to solve problems with fists. Now he'd learned—sometimes a cookie worked better than a punch.

"Remember, if you take my cookies, you don't play with Iron anymore."

"No playing with Iron!"

"Never!"

The children chanted in unison, oblivious to the cunning glint in David's eyes.

Meanwhile, tension thickened at the construction site.

"Michael!" Samuel rushed over, sweat beading on his forehead. "Charles is in trouble!"

The brick in Michael's hand thudded to the ground, kicking up dust.

The three men moved to a secluded spot where Samuel lowered his voice. "His fiancée's family suddenly demanded two hundred for the bride price—plus the Three Turns and One Sound!"

"What?" Daniel nearly jumped. "Are they insane?"

An average rural bride price barely reached one hundred. The Three Turns package totaled nearly a thousand!

"What did his girl say?" Michael asked grimly.

Samuel gave a bitter laugh. "She said once a daughter's married, she's spilled water—no say in family matters."

Michael's eyes narrowed. Charles had mentioned the girl was plain. Why would her family dare demand so much?

Unless...

"Someone leaked information," he said coldly. "Find out who's pulling strings behind this."
###Chapter 117: Just a Passing Stranger

The sharp clink of a coffee cup hitting the floor shattered the silence. Brown liquid seeped into the carpet, leaving a dark stain.

Su Wan shot to her feet, her fingers trembling slightly. She stared at Shen Mo, whose expression remained indifferent, her throat tight. "So... you've always seen me as an outsider?"

Outside, the rain grew heavier, droplets tapping against the window like countless tiny needles.

Shen Mo adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm, his tone icy. "Miss Su, we were only ever business partners."

The words cut like a knife, piercing straight through her heart. All those late-night conversations, the quiet moments they'd shared over the past three months—had they meant nothing to him?

"Business partners?" Su Wan let out a hollow laugh, her eyes glistening. "Then why did you—"

"It was just part of the act." He cut her off, his gaze flickering over her reddened eyes. "Profit comes first. Surely you understand that."

The rain drummed harder, filling the room with the bitter scent of spilled coffee.

Su Wan clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. Now she saw it clearly—every tender glance, every fleeting touch—had all been carefully orchestrated traps.

"Impressive, Mr. Shen." She lifted her chin, clinging to the last shreds of her pride. "I was a fool to believe otherwise."

His phone lit up with a notification. Against her will, her eyes caught the familiar profile picture—Miss Lin, the heiress to Lin Corporation and Shen Mo's rumored fiancée.

So that was it.

She turned toward the door, her steps unsteady as if walking on cotton. Behind her, Shen Mo's voice remained detached. "I'll have the contract delivered tomorrow."

Su Wan didn't look back. Only when the elevator doors closed did she finally let the tears fall.

The mirrored walls reflected her shattered reflection. In this meticulously crafted game, she had never been anything more than a pitiful outsider.

Samuel Bright arrived at Michael Stone's house in a hurry, his face as grim as if it were covered in frost. Without even stopping for a sip of water, he got straight to the point: "I came as soon as I heard. Is Charles home? His fiancée's family suddenly demanded the 'Three Turns and One Sound' dowry plus five hundred yuan. That’s practically extortion!"

Though Charles Clark was strong, he was only the second son in his family—neither the favored youngest nor the eldest who managed household affairs. Every time he earned money outside, he was lucky to keep thirty percent for himself.

After a month of hard work with their group of four, the profits split according to their investments left Charles with just over three hundred yuan—nowhere near enough to cover even a fraction of the dowry.

"Even if he had the money, he shouldn’t give it!" Daniel River slammed the table in frustration before turning to Michael, who had remained silent. "Michael, say something!"

Both Samuel and Daniel stared at Michael expectantly.

"This is Charles’ family matter," Michael finally spoke, his voice low. "We're still outsiders after all."

Daniel nearly jumped in agitation. "Michael! That girl’s family is clearly taking advantage! What gives them the right?"

What gave them the right? The fact that Charles was head over heels for her?

Samuel analyzed calmly, "This doesn’t seem straightforward. A sudden price hike like this—I suspect they don’t actually want to marry their daughter off."

"Could something have happened in their family?" Daniel suddenly wondered.

"Not sure," Samuel shook his head. "I’ll look into it. The girl’s from the neighboring brigade—I’ll make a trip there."

Daniel clenched his teeth. "Even if Charles is willing, we have to stop him! If he gives in this time, who knows what they’ll demand next? They’ll bleed him dry!"

After a long silence, Michael finally made a decision. "Samuel, go find Charles. Everyone’s coming here for dinner tonight."

Samuel’s eyes lit up. "I heard Emily bought meat?"

Michael gave a slight nod. "Yes, a little."

Without lingering further, Samuel left to find Charles, while Daniel and Michael returned to their work.

Samuel searched half the village before finally spotting Charles sitting alone on the high riverbank, lost in thought.

"Charles," Samuel sat down beside him, gazing at the shimmering water. "Emily bought meat today. Michael wants us all to come for dinner tonight."

Suddenly, Charles buried his head in his hands, his voice breaking. "Why? Everything was agreed upon! I was planning to marry this winter, have a few kids... She’s just an ordinary village girl..."


###Chapter 118: Just Give Up!

"Miss Lin, I advise you to just give up."

In the café, the man adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his gaze behind the lenses laced with disdain. He slid a document across the table toward Lin Chuxia, his fingers tapping lightly on the surface.

Lin Chuxia stared at the file, her nails digging unconsciously into her palms. She took a deep breath, forcing down the storm of emotions rising within her.

"Attorney Zhang, my father’s company couldn’t possibly—"

"Miss Lin," Attorney Zhang interrupted with a professional smile, "the court has already accepted the bankruptcy petition. The debts your father owes are not something a fresh graduate like you can handle."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting harsh light on Lin Chuxia’s pale face. Her fists clenched until her knuckles turned white.

"My father was framed!"

Attorney Zhang shook his head and pulled out another set of photos from his briefcase. The images showed Lin’s father speaking with several unfamiliar men outside a hotel.

"This evidence is enough to prove your father’s involvement in commercial fraud. Miss Lin, a wise person knows when to yield."

Lin Chuxia shot to her feet, knocking over her coffee cup. The dark liquid spread across the table. Her chest heaved as she glared at the photos.

"These are fake!"

"Truth or fabrication doesn’t matter," Attorney Zhang said calmly, wiping coffee splashes from his suit. "What matters is what the court will believe."

Lin Chuxia bit her lower lip until she tasted blood. Suddenly, she snatched the photos from the table and turned to leave.

"Miss Lin!" Attorney Zhang called after her. "Your father has already confessed in custody! Struggling further is pointless!"

Her steps faltered for a split second, but she didn’t look back. Pushing open the café’s glass door, she stepped outside, the sunlight stinging her eyes.

Her phone buzzed abruptly. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Hello?"

"Miss Lin," a deep male voice spoke on the other end. "Do you want to save your father?"

Her heartbeat spiked. Gripping the phone tighter, she whispered, "Who are you?"

"Tomorrow at 3 PM. The abandoned factory on the outskirts. Come alone."

The line went dead. Standing amidst the bustling crowd, Lin Chuxia felt the world spinning around her.

She lifted her gaze to the sky—still bright, still indifferent. But she knew, from this moment on, her life would never be the same.

"She wasn't like those educated youths who abandoned their partners to return to the city. But who would've thought..." Charles Clark crouched on the ground, his voice choked with emotion. "Daisy's family suddenly raised the bride price to two hundred yuan, plus the 'Three Turns and One Sound.'"

Samuel Bright frowned. He'd never met Daisy Lee, but Charles had often spoken of her.

"She's not the prettiest, but she's hardworking," Charles had once described her. "She can work the fields with me, not delicate like your wife."

Back then, whenever Charles mentioned his sweetheart, his eyes would shine. Even while on the road, he'd mutter, "What should I bring back for Daisy?"

Once, seeing Samuel selling lipstick, Charles secretly bought a tube. "Daisy will love this," he'd said, blushing.

Now, those same eyes were dull with despair.

"Could her family be in trouble?" Samuel sensed something amiss. "Why else would they demand so much suddenly?"

Even city girls wouldn't ask for such a price, let alone a village girl. A matchmaker had guaranteed the arrangement during their courtship.

"I don't know..." Charles raked his hands through his hair, his voice hoarse. "We'd already set the wedding date..."

His parents would never agree to such an amount.

"Come on, let's ask Lucy Smith for the truth." Samuel pulled him up. "Don't you want to know why?"

Charles stumbled after him. He hated troubling his friend, but he needed answers.

Lucy's home was a modest adobe house. Seeing them, she sighed.

"Charles, this is my fault," Lucy lamented, slapping her thigh. "I'll find you a better match. Forget about Daisy."

Samuel narrowed his eyes. "What really happened?"

The truth spilled out—Daisy's older brother had been caught sleeping with the village widow. The widow's in-laws demanded compensation, and with the Lees unable to pay, they turned to extorting the bride price.

"Hearing Charles had money, they got greedy," Lucy said bitterly. "My friend told me in confidence. Not many know yet."

Charles froze as if struck by lightning. His honest future brother-in-law—capable of such a thing?


###Chapter 119: Begging for Mercy

"Please..." She knelt on the cold marble floor, her delicate fingers clutching desperately at the hem of the man's trousers, her knuckles turning white from the strain.

The man looked down at her, a cruel smirk playing at the corners of his lips. "Now you beg?"

Tears streamed down her cheeks, splashing onto the polished floor. Once a proud heiress, she now cowered like a stray dog.

"I'll do anything..." Her voice trembled with despair. "Just spare my father..."

The man bent down, his long fingers gripping her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. The warmth that once filled his eyes had vanished, replaced by an icy chill.

"Too late," he murmured, his voice deceptively soft. "The moment you betrayed me, this was inevitable."

She shuddered, her nails digging into her palms until blood seeped between her fingers—yet she felt no pain.

"I was wrong..." she choked out between sobs. "I know I was wrong..."

Abruptly, he released her, and she collapsed to the floor. He turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silhouette rigid and unfeeling.

"If you want to beg, then beg properly," he said without looking back. "Take it off."

Her head snapped up, disbelief written across her face. Outside, lightning split the sky, casting an eerie glow over his sharp profile—and her ashen complexion.

"What? Not willing?" He let out a cold laugh. "Then prepare to bury your father."

She bit her lip hard enough to taste blood. With trembling hands, she slowly reached for the collar of her dress...


Samuel Bright frowned deeply, clearly shocked by the news.

"This isn't simple," he muttered. "Even if your girl's brother was framed, it's too late to prove it now."

Charles Clark stood nearby, looking as if all the life had been drained from him. His rough fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of his shirt, his knuckles turning white.

Seeing this, matchmaker Lucy Smith quickly tried to smooth things over. "Samuel's right. Settling this will cost a fortune." She patted Charles' shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry, I'll find you a better girl—one whose family won't give you trouble."

Samuel pulled Charles away, noticing how his arm trembled.

"Stop thinking about it," Samuel sighed. "The Lees are a bottomless pit. That widow's family will keep extorting money over this. Come on, let's go fishing by the river. We'll have a good meal at Daniel's tonight."

Charles nodded numbly, his eyes hollow as if his soul had left his body.

Just as they reached the village entrance, a frantic voice called out—

"Charles! Charles!"

A girl in a patched floral dress came running after them, her braids bouncing, tear tracks still fresh on her cheeks.

Samuel immediately stepped in front of Charles, blocking her. "Margaret Lee, it's over between you two."

"No!" Margaret stomped her foot in frustration. "It was all my father's idea, not mine!" Her tear-filled eyes pleaded with Charles. "Charles, believe me..."

Samuel scoffed. "Your family demanded an outrageous bride price—who could afford that? Now that you're in trouble, you suddenly remember Charles?"

Margaret's face paled. Her family was in chaos—her sister-in-law had divorced, and the widow's relatives kept harassing them, threatening to press indecency charges against her brother unless they paid up.

"Charles..." Her voice shook. "I know you have money. Please help me, and I swear I'll be a good wife to you..."

Charles jerked his head up, his expression conflicted.

Samuel laughed coldly. "See? She just wants to drain your savings for her family!"

"We..." Charles' voice was hoarse. "We're done."

Margaret suddenly dropped to her knees, tears soaking her dress. "I'm begging you, Charles... Without money, my family is finished..."

Charles turned away, fists clenched so tight they trembled. "I can't help you."

Margaret collapsed to the ground, her desperation twisting into utter despair.


###Chapter 120: Her Trust Was Betrayed

Emily stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her nails digging deep into her palms.

"Director Johnson, the board has voted," her assistant said cautiously, handing her the documents. "Effective today, you'll be transferred to the subsidiary."

The sunlight outside was blinding, yet she only felt a chilling cold seep through her bones.

Three months ago, she had been the youngest executive in the company. Everyone had whispered that she was the undeniable successor to the CEO position.

"Why?" Her voice came out hoarse.

The assistant hesitated. "It... was Mr. Stone's proposal."

Michael Stone.

The name stabbed through her heart like a blade.

She remembered last night's celebration—how he had raised his champagne glass to her with that smile. That toast hadn't been for her success. It had been her farewell.

"I see." She straightened her back, her voice eerily calm.

The moment the elevator doors closed, her eyes finally reddened.

In this game, she had never been a player—only a pawn.


The same Charles Clark who had once run through the market to buy her hair ribbons, who had picked wild berries for her under the scorching sun, who had saved every penny to gift her lipstick—now seemed like a completely different person.

"Charles, please..." Margaret Lee clung desperately to his sleeve, tears streaming down her face. "If we can't get the money, my father really will sell me to that cripple from the neighboring village..."

She wasn’t lying.

In this family, she had always been the least valued.

To gather the dowry for her eldest brother, her father was capable of anything.

"Charles..." Her voice trembled, her nails digging into his arm.

Charles’s heart ached as if pricked by needles. After all this time together, pretending there was no affection between them would be a lie.

"Daisy, I really..." He swallowed hard. "The 'Three Turns and One Sound' requires coupons—where am I supposed to get those?"

Margaret’s eyes lit up. "You could borrow from Samuel and the others!"

Samuel Bright let out a sharp laugh.

"Why should we?" He pulled Charles back. "You want your man to shoulder a decade of debt? You’ve got quite the scheme figured out."

Samuel eyed her coldly. "Why doesn’t your family borrow the money? Selling your daughter is so easy—too bad you’re not worth the price."

Margaret’s face turned deathly pale.

She had thought Charles still cared for her, and since he had earned money on this trip, his friends could help make up the difference.

Once married, she would have lived a proper life...

But she had been naive.

Charles stared at Samuel in surprise, never expecting his friend to be so blunt.

He truly didn’t have the money.

But... after all this time together...

"Marry with the original dowry or cut ties cleanly," Samuel said firmly. "No in-between."

Margaret panicked.

Her brother was counting on this money!

"Charles..." She dropped to her knees. "Treat it as a loan—I’ll pay it back, I swear..."

Charles raked his hands through his hair in anguish. "I can’t borrow that much!"

"Let’s go." Samuel tugged Charles away. "This isn’t our problem."

Behind them, Margaret’s heart-wrenching sobs echoed. Charles hesitated mid-step but ultimately followed.

"Don’t be a fool," Samuel muttered under his breath. "That’s over a thousand dollars!"

They had earned money this time, but who wasn’t barely scraping by?

Building a house, getting married—everything required money.

"I know..." Charles’s voice was bitter. Even the largest share from their third brother was barely over a thousand—and he had been injured...

"Come to my place first. We’ll visit our third brother later."


###Chapter 121: Rare Meat

After finishing their work, Michael Stone and Daniel River walked home side by side.

"Coming with me, Daniel?" Michael patted his cousin's shoulder.

Daniel's eyes gleamed as he remembered Emily had gone to town today. He licked his lips. "Sure, let's see what goodies Emily brought back."

Truthfully, he was still preoccupied with Charles Clark's situation. That girl's family suddenly demanding such a hefty dowry—something was definitely off.

As soon as they stepped into the yard, they heard Emily's clear voice teaching the children a poem.

"Dad! Uncle Daniel!" The two boys came running over, bouncing with excitement.

Emily looked up in surprise. "You're back early today. Dinner isn't ready yet."

Without a word, Michael headed straight for the kitchen. "I'll cook. You stay with the kids."

"There's meat in the cupboard," Emily called after him.

Daniel's eyes lit up at the mention of meat. He eagerly followed Michael into the kitchen and watched as his cousin pulled out a plate of deep red meat.

"Lean pork?" Daniel leaned in to sniff.

Michael didn't look up. "Beef."

"What?!" Daniel nearly jumped. "Where did Emily get that? Cattle are the team's treasure!"

"Bought it in town." Michael was already slicing the meat.

Daniel swallowed hard. "Emily's got great luck... How are we cooking it?"

"Stir-fry some, stew the rest with potatoes."

Just as they got busy, the gate creaked open again. Charles Clark and Samuel Bright walked in, carrying fish and a woven basket.

"Hello, Emily!" they greeted in unison.

Emily smiled and nodded. She noticed the complicated look in Charles' eyes when he glanced at her.

"Uncle Samuel! Uncle Charles!" The boys rushed toward the bucket. "Fish! Dad makes the best sour fish stew!"

"Sorry to intrude," Charles said awkwardly.

"Not at all. They're in the kitchen." Emily gestured toward the smoke rising from the chimney.

Inside, Michael was stir-frying the beef, its rich aroma filling the air. Daniel crouched by the stove, feeding it firewood.

"Michael, we caught some fish," Samuel said, setting the bucket down.

"Perfect. We'll add another dish." Michael kept his focus on the pan. "Clean them."

Daniel grinned conspiratorially. "Emily bought beef. We're in for a treat tonight."

Charles and Samuel exchanged glances, both visibly delighted. Beef—now that was a rare delicacy!

"David, go pick some scallions," Michael instructed.

The boys dashed off to the vegetable patch. The four men worked efficiently in the kitchen, the clatter of pots and pans filling the space.

Standing at the doorway, Emily watched the scene, a soft smile tugging at her lips. Amid the curling smoke, this winter evening felt unusually warm.
###Chapter 122: The Scheme Behind the Exorbitant Bride Price

The dining table was laden with seven or eight dishes, and Emily Johnson couldn't help but marvel inwardly. She hadn’t expected these men to put together such an impressive spread.

"Let's eat."

Surprisingly, the meal was unusually quiet. No one used the occasion to discuss business—only the clinking of bowls and chopsticks broke the silence.

"Try the fish belly—it's the most tender part with fewer bones."

Emily didn’t refuse. Since she hadn’t cooked, she might as well enjoy the meal. With Michael Stone’s brothers present, her only concern was making sure David and Tommy were taken care of.

After dinner, she helped the boys clear the table. The men had polished off every last bite, which pleased her.

"Alright, let’s hear it. What’s the deal with your girl?" Michael got straight to the point.

Charles Clark grimaced. "She’s not my girl anymore. Her family’s bride price is beyond what I can afford."

"How much? Enlighten me." Daniel River perked up. At marriageable age himself, he was already fielding proposals.

Under everyone’s scrutiny, Charles sighed. "Two hundred bucks, plus the 'Three Turns and One Sound.'"

Daniel sucked in a sharp breath. "Even city girls don’t ask for that much! Around here, the standard’s eighty bucks with the '36 Legs'!"

Even Michael frowned slightly. Though he’d never met Charles’ ex, he knew the going rates for rural brides.

"Charles, you messed up," Daniel teased, waggling his eyebrows. "If she’s demanding that much, she must be a real beauty—prettier than Emily?"

The temperature in the room dropped instantly. "Don’t compare my wife to anyone else," Michael said coldly.

Daniel hurried to backtrack. "Emily’s the loveliest girl in ten villages."

Charles nodded earnestly. "No one compares to Emily."

"Then what gives her family the nerve to ask so much?" Daniel scoffed. "Two hundred bucks? That’s years of savings for most families!"

Samuel Bright, silent until now, spoke up. "Charles and I went to see Lucy Smith. Turns out Sophia Green’s older brother was caught sleeping with Widow Collins. Her in-laws demanded three hundred in compensation. They probably heard Charles made good money on this trip and noticed how generously he spoiled his girl. The Greens are just being greedy."

"Sleeping with a widow?" Daniel’s eyes widened. "That widow must be worth her weight in gold!"

Michael’s brow furrowed. Something felt off. "Sounds like a setup."

Samuel nodded. "Michael, should we look into the widow’s in-laws? This reeks of a trap. They must’ve known we came back with money."

With the enemy hidden and them exposed, it was a tricky situation.

Charles looked lost. "What trap?"

Michael sighed. "I took you all out to earn money for marriage, but it seems I’ve only brought you trouble."

The three men replied in unison, "Not at all!"
###Chapter 123: The Watcher in the Shadows

The elevator doors slid open with a soft ding.

Emily Johnson stepped out quickly, her high heels clicking urgently against the marble floor. She couldn't shake the feeling of being watched—like unseen eyes followed her every move. But each time she glanced back, the hallway stretched empty behind her.

Am I just being paranoid? She tightened her grip on her purse strap.

Her phone buzzed suddenly. An unknown number flashed on the screen:
[Red looks good on you today.]

Emily froze, her blood turning to ice. She was wearing a red dress—one she’d pulled from her closet just this morning. No one could have known.

At the far end of the hall, a security camera rotated silently, its red light blinking in the dimness like a malevolent eye.

She quickened her pace, fumbling with her keys. The metallic scrape of the lock echoed too loudly. Just as the door shut behind her, she thought she heard—

A quiet laugh.

"Who's there?" Her voice trembled.

Silence.

Back pressed against the door, Emily slid to the floor. Her phone buzzed again. She didn’t want to look—but she had to.

A second message:
[Don’t be afraid. We’ll meet soon.]

Outside the window, a shadow flickered past without a sound.


"Michael, we couldn't be more grateful!" Samuel Bright clutched the money he'd just received, his fingers trembling slightly. The sum was more than he'd earned in the past year.

Michael Stone's sharp gaze swept over the three men. "We might have drawn attention," he murmured, voice barely audible. "Stay sharp from now on."

Daniel River immediately straightened. "Don't worry, Michael. I only gave my parents twenty dollars and told them I'd made fifty."

"I didn't even buy new clothes," Samuel added, thinking of the malt extract his grandmother and sister had been savoring so carefully at home.

Charles Clark suddenly flushed red. "I... I bought Daisy a lipstick..."

Three pairs of eyes locked onto him.

"A five-dollar lipstick?" Michael's brow furrowed. "You might as well have announced you struck gold."

Charles looked as if he'd been struck by lightning. Now he understood why Daisy's family had suddenly raised the dowry.

"Daddy!" Two little bundles of energy burst into the room, shattering the tense atmosphere.

Emily Johnson stood in the doorway, a dust cloth still in her hand. The temperature in the room seemed to have plummeted.

"Samuel, your sister knows how to knit, right?" Michael abruptly changed the subject, scooping up little Tommy as he rushed toward him.

Samuel blinked. "Yeah, she learned from the village women."

"Have her come teach your sister-in-law tomorrow."

When the three men left, Emily noticed the change in their eyes—what had once been disdain had turned to something like awe.

Late that night, Michael stoked the fire in the kitchen. The wood crackled and popped.

"Mommy," David whispered, burrowing under the covers and blinking up at her with wide eyes. "Why don't you let Daddy sleep here?"

Emily's hand jerked, nearly tipping over the enamel mug.

"Did you two fight?" Tommy piped up in his tiny voice, scooting closer.

The moonlight spilled through the window, illuminating their innocent faces as they stared at her expectantly.

Emily's throat tightened. How could she explain that this "husband" was a complete stranger to her?

In the kitchen, the water reached a boil, the lid rattling as steam escaped—much like the turmoil in her heart.


###Chapter 124: I Don't Need It

"Miss Gu, this is a gift specially prepared for you by the CEO."

The assistant respectfully handed over an exquisite gift box, its gold-embossed logo gleaming under the sunlight.

I glanced at it but didn’t reach out.

"Take it back."

The assistant hesitated. "But the CEO said—"

"I said, take it back." My voice was icy as I cut him off. "I don’t need it."

The assistant opened his mouth to protest but fell silent under my sharp glare.

After a moment of hesitation, he finally withdrew the box.

I turned on my heel and walked away, the click of my heels echoing crisply against the marble floor.

Behind me, the assistant called out anxiously, "Miss Gu, the CEO truly cares about you—"

I stopped in my tracks and let out a cold laugh.

"Cares?"

Slowly, I turned back and spoke each word deliberately.

"Tell him I don’t need his charity."

The assistant paled, the gift box suddenly burning in his hands.

I left without another glance, though my heart ached as if pierced by needles.

How dare that man think luxury gifts could make up for everything?

My phone buzzed suddenly.

A message flashed on the screen:

"Why did you refuse my gift?"

I stared at it for a long time, fingers hovering over the keyboard.

In the end, I typed only three words in reply:

"You don’t deserve it."

The conversation circled back to the same issue.

"Daddy stays with you at night because he's worried you might be scared," Emily Johnson said, forcing her voice to remain gentle.

The two little boys blinked their big, innocent eyes.

"But Mommy, we're really not scared," David said, tilting his head. "Daddy should go back and sleep with you."

Tommy immediately nodded in agreement, his chubby face serious. "Yeah! Me and David are big boys now."

Emily sighed inwardly. You might not be scared, but I am!

A young man full of vigor—what if things got out of hand?

"Mommy," David suddenly leaned in and whispered conspiratorially, "do you not like Daddy?"

Emily's heart skipped a beat.

"But if you don't like Daddy, how did me and Tommy get here?" The little boy answered his own question with terrifyingly clear logic.

Who taught him that?!

"Mommy, please forgive Daddy," Tommy chimed in sweetly.

"Yeah, let Daddy come back to sleep with you!"

Emily assumed the boys just wanted their family to be happy—completely unaware that someone had put them up to this.

In the kitchen, Michael Stone sneezed as he added firewood to the stove. He remembered his wife liked cleanliness. Though she didn’t bathe daily in winter like summer, she still washed every few days.

"Daddy!" David bounded into the kitchen. "Mommy said you can go back to sleep with her!"

What?

Emily's eyes widened. When did I agree to that?!

This was pure slander!

But Michael acted as if he didn’t notice his wife’s stunned expression and calmly nodded. "Then you two will sleep alone tonight."

This man climbs the ladder way too fast!

"We’re not scared!" David thumped his little chest confidently.

Emily didn’t want to watch this father-son act any longer and turned to wash up.

"Honey, wait for me—"

Just as she was about to close the door, a large hand stopped it.

"It’s cold outside," Michael said pitifully.

"You can sleep with the kids," Emily gritted out.

"But David steals the blanket, and Tommy kicks me," the man whined like a scolded puppy.

Meeting those dewy eyes, Emily almost softened.

"Do whatever you want," she relented.

With months left before the college entrance exams, they couldn’t keep sleeping apart forever.

"Honey, I promise I won’t touch you," Michael swore solemnly.

Can a man’s promise be trusted?

"I’ll warm the bed for you," he added.

I don’t need it!

The temperature was still around 68°F at night—nowhere near cold enough.

Without the kids as a buffer, Emily felt uneasy.

"Honey, stop reading. Time to sleep," Michael said, already stripped down to his undershirt and slipping under the covers.

The blanket outlined his muscular frame, hinting at well-defined pecs.

A sudden thought crossed Emily’s mind: Does he really have an eight-pack?
###Chapter 125: Burning Gaze in the Dark

"I can't see clearly..."

Michael Stone noticed his wife staring intently at him, her almond-shaped eyes filled with confusion and anticipation.

"Emily, time for bed," he called softly.

Only then did Emily Johnson snap out of her thoughts.

Winter nights came early—by five o'clock, darkness had already settled in. Though it was barely seven now, what else was there to do in this era without electricity besides sleep?

"Do you want the outside or the inside?" she asked.

"Outside."

She sighed in relief, grateful she was wearing her thin thermal underwear—hopefully, he wouldn’t notice anything amiss. Quickly slipping under the covers, she wrapped herself tightly.

"Turn off the lamp."

How could Michael not notice his wife’s nervousness? His gaze never left her, capturing even the slightest movement.

Emily had a stunning figure, one that didn’t betray she’d borne two children. The curves beneath her clothes were impossible to ignore—full in all the right places, arresting his attention.

"Alright."

The moment the kerosene lamp went out, darkness swallowed the room. Though they lay apart, sharing the same quilt meant Michael could still catch the faint, delicate fragrance clinging to her.

"Why are you staring at me instead of sleeping?" Emily kept her eyes shut but could feel the heat of his gaze lingering on her face. In the pitch black, she shouldn’t have been able to see anything, yet the intensity of his stare made sleep impossible. Finally, she opened her eyes and asked coolly.

"I just want to look at my wife a little longer."

Emily rolled her eyes. "It’s pitch dark. Do you think you’re an owl or something?"

Was he teasing her?

"Your face is already carved into my heart."

Oh, smooth talker.

"Go to sleep. Aren’t you tired from working all day?" she deflected. Building a house was grueling labor—even as a helper, a full day’s work should have left him exhausted.

"Sleeping now." Michael’s heart swelled with warmth. His wife was worried about him. Even if she didn’t remember their past, her care remained.

Emily had expected insomnia. She’d always slept alone and rarely shared a bed with anyone. Yet, in her drowsiness, she found herself unconsciously gravitating toward the warmth beside her—even reaching out to embrace him.

Half-asleep, Michael felt someone nestle into his arms. Looking down, he realized it was Emily who had initiated the contact. A smile tugged at his lips as he gently pulled her closer, contentment lulling him back to sleep.

Emily remained oblivious—by the time she woke the next morning, Michael was already up.

"Emily, breakfast is ready."

Hearing his call, she hurried out of bed.

Had he made breakfast again? Emily couldn’t help but marvel: a man who could earn money, cook, dote on his wife, and adore his children—even in modern times, he’d be a catch.

Too bad she was just a side character.

On the table were sweet potato porridge, steamed eggs, and stir-fried potatoes with sauerkraut.

"Robert and William still have a few more days of work. Once they’re done, I’ll take you to town," Michael said as he ladled out the porridge.

"Dad, I want to go too!" Tommy immediately piped up.

"You’re still too young. I’ll take you when you’re older," Michael brushed him off.

Neither child pressed further.

"Sure," Emily agreed readily. She’d been wanting to visit town—maybe she could find a way to make some money. After all, she was strapped for cash and needed to buy goods from PennyDeals to resell.
###Chapter 126: Amy Bright

"Money gives you confidence," Emily Johnson mused, rubbing the bills in her pocket. The weight of them settled her nerves.

"Samuel's sister will come by later to teach you how to knit sweaters," Michael Stone reminded her before leaving. "If you can't get the hang of it, just give her the yarn. We’ll repay her with some fabric later."

Emily raised an eyebrow. "Isn’t that taking advantage of her?"

"That girl’s only sixteen, but she’s got real skill," Michael said, buttoning up his quilted coat. "All the village girls ask for her help."

Emily gave a noncommittal nod. She’d see when the girl arrived.

After breakfast, Michael went to help his second brother. The two boys ran off to play. Emily had just pulled out her exam papers when a knock sounded at the gate.

"Who is it?"

Opening the door, she found a girl with braided hair. Her skin was sun-kissed, her hair tips slightly sun-bleached, and her thin frame wrapped in a patched-up quilted coat. But her eyes shone bright and lively.

"I’m Amy Bright," the girl said cheerfully. "My brother said you wanted to learn knitting?"

Emily blinked. So this was Samuel’s talented younger sister?

"Come in."

Amy stole glances at the rumored educated youth. Her skin was pale as snow, her features delicate. No wonder Samuel never wanted her doing fieldwork.

In the main room, Emily pushed a cup of powdered milk toward her.

"P-Powdered milk?" Amy’s hands trembled. She’d only ever seen this luxury in the Supply & Market display case.

"I’ll get the yarn," Emily said, disappearing into the inner room.

When the gray cashmere yarn was spread out on the kang table, Amy’s eyes widened.

"This… this is imported cashmere, isn’t it?" She touched it gingerly. "Three pounds could make three sweaters. The babies’ will use less—most of it will go into Samuel’s."

Emily exhaled in relief. "Then I’ll leave it to you." She pulled out a piece of floral fabric from under the yarn. "This is for you, as thanks."

"I can’t accept that!" Amy waved her hands frantically. "Samuel’s helped our family so much over the years..."

"If you won’t take it, I’ll find someone else," Emily said sternly.

Amy bit her lip. Her grandmother had whispered last night that if Emily couldn’t learn, she should just finish the knitting herself.

"Then… thank you, sis," she murmured, blushing as she accepted the fabric.

Emily then produced a bar of soap like magic. "Bought it in town—no coupons needed."

Amy’s hands shook as she held the soap. This trip was more than worth it!
###Chapter 127: Protective Instincts

"What do you think you're doing?" Su Nuan grabbed Li Yuan's wrist with such force that the other girl winced in pain.

Li Yuan yanked her hand free, sneering. "Oh, what? Feeling protective now?"

Su Nuan stepped in front of Lin Xiaoyu, her gaze sharp. "If you have something to say, say it properly. Resorting to violence just shows how weak you are."

"Please, spare me the act," Li Yuan scoffed. "Where was your righteous intervention when she stole my boyfriend?"

Lin Xiaoyu tugged at Su Nuan's sleeve, her voice barely audible. "Nuan, just let it go..."

"Let it go?" Su Nuan shot her a glare. "You're going to take this kind of bullying lying down?"

A crowd of curious onlookers had gathered, murmurs rippling through them.

"Did you hear? Li Yuan got cheated on..."

"Serves her right—she’s always been so arrogant..."

Li Yuan’s face darkened. Suddenly, she raised her hand to strike.

Su Nuan reacted instantly, seizing her wrist. "Don’t you dare!"

"Let go!" Li Yuan struggled but couldn’t break free.

"Apologize," Su Nuan’s voice was icy. "To Xiaoyu. Now."

"Why should I?" Li Yuan spat through gritted teeth.

Su Nuan tightened her grip. "Because you just tried to hit someone for no reason."

Li Yuan paled from the pain and finally forced out three reluctant words: "I’m... sorry."

Only then did Su Nuan release her, pulling Lin Xiaoyu away without another glance.

Behind them, Li Yuan shouted furiously, "Su Nuan, you’ll regret this!"

"Anytime," Su Nuan called back, waving dismissively without turning around.

At the corner, Lin Xiaoyu suddenly hugged her. "Nuan... thank you."

Su Nuan patted her back. "Silly girl, don’t be such a pushover next time."

"But..." Lin Xiaoyu hesitated.

"But what?"

"Li Yuan’s family has connections..."

Su Nuan smirked. "So what?"

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number. "Hey, big brother. Someone’s threatening your little sister..."

A deep chuckle came through the line. "Who’s stupid enough to do that?"

Su Nuan’s lips curved. "A girl named Li Yuan. Apparently, her family has some pull."

"Got it." The voice on the other end turned cold. "Leave it to me."

Hanging up, Su Nuan winked at Lin Xiaoyu. "Done."

Lin Xiaoyu gaped. "Your... your brother is...?"

"Shh—" Su Nuan pressed a finger to her lips. "That’s a secret."

Meanwhile, Li Yuan was on the phone, sobbing. "Dad, someone’s bullying me..."

After a pause, an enraged shout erupted from the receiver. "Out of all people, you had to provoke someone from the Su family?!"

Li Yuan froze. "The... Su family?"

"Apologize immediately!" The command was absolute. "Right now!"

Under the setting sun, the two girls’ shadows stretched long across the ground. Lin Xiaoyu glanced at Su Nuan’s profile and suddenly realized how dependable her usually carefree best friend could be.

"Nuan..."

"Yeah?"

"You were... really cool back there."

Su Nuan burst out laughing and slung an arm around her shoulders. "Of course! Come on, let’s get ice cream!"

From the shadows of the school building, a tall figure watched them walk away, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Soap?"

Emily Johnson pulled out an exquisitely wrapped bar from the drawer, and Amy Bright's eyes instantly widened.

"This... this is too precious!" Amy waved her hands frantically, her cheeks flushing red. "I can't accept it."

Emily pressed the soap into her hands without hesitation. "I bought too many last time. I don't care for this scent."

"But..." Amy clutched the soap awkwardly. Such luxuries were rare—few families in the village could afford them.

"If you won't take it, I'll have to take back the yarn." Emily pretended to reach for the ball of yarn on the table.

"No!" Amy hugged the yarn protectively, stamping her foot in protest. "Fine, I'll take it!"

Only then did Emily smile in satisfaction. "Then I'll trouble you with this."

Amy stole a glance at the soap in her hand, thinking to herself: Why does my sister-in-law act like she's guarding against thieves, as if afraid I'd lose out?

"Sister-in-law, should I add any patterns to the sweater?"

"No need." Emily shook her head. "What use do men have for fancy designs?"

She then prepared another steaming bowl of powdered milk and insisted Amy finish it before letting her leave.

"I'll head back now." Amy cradled the yarn as if it were treasure.

Watching the young girl's retreating figure, Emily sighed in relief. She could have easily bought a ready-made sweater, but that would have been too ostentatious. Even the clothes she'd bought for the children were the plainest styles available in this era.

In the Bright family's courtyard, Grandma Bright sat on the doorstep, sewing shoe soles.

"Grandma!" Amy rushed in excitedly. "Look!"

She presented the soap and a piece of floral fabric to her grandmother like prized offerings.

"Oh my!" Grandma Bright's eyes lit up. "This soap smells wonderful!" She brought it closer to inhale the fragrance. "And this fabric is perfect—just right for making you a new padded jacket."

"Sister-in-law said she didn't like it..." Amy explained softly.

Grandma Bright patted her granddaughter's head. "Your sister-in-law is a good person."

Amy nodded vigorously. "I'll wash my hands right away and start knitting her sweater!"

......

"Sister-in-law! Are you home?"

Emily was reading when she heard a familiar voice calling from outside.

"Ethan?" She opened the door to find the boy holding a bundle of dirt-covered objects.

"Sister-in-law, guess what this is?" Ethan held them up proudly.

Emily examined them closely. "Yams?"

"Yes!" Ethan said excitedly. "Much easier to handle than kudzu roots—just peel and eat!"

Emily smiled and nodded. "Exactly. You can steam them or stir-fry them. Just be careful when digging so they don't break—they store well."

Since there was no fieldwork to do, Ethan had taken to exploring the mountains daily, always returning with some wild harvest.
###Chapter 128: Watching from the Shadows

The night was ink-black, thick and impenetrable.

Emily tightened her trench coat and hurried through the alley behind the hospital. Her high heels clicked sharply against the damp cobblestones, the sound jarring in the silent night.

She glanced over her shoulder instinctively.

No one was there.

"Too jumpy," she muttered with a self-deprecating laugh and kept walking. Yet her fingers unconsciously tightened around her bag strap, knuckles turning white.

At the corner of her vision, a shadow flickered past.

Emily froze, her pulse spiking. She held her breath, eyes locked on the spot.

"Who's there?"

No answer.

Only the rustle of leaves in the night wind.

She inhaled deeply, forcing herself to stay calm. Probably just a stray cat, she told herself. But as she turned—

A pair of eyes.

Staring straight at her from a second-floor window.

Her blood turned to ice. That gaze was all too familiar, plunging her into a frozen abyss.

Him.

Why was he here?

No time to think. She bolted. The hem of her coat fluttered like the wings of a startled butterfly. The contents of her bag clattered, but she didn’t care.

She had to get away.

Now.

After rounding three corners, she finally dared to stop and catch her breath. Pressed against the cold brick wall, her shirt clung to her back, soaked with sweat.

Her phone buzzed.

A text from an unknown number:
"Running? Afraid someone might see?"

Her fingers trembled so violently she could barely hold the phone. She bit down on her lip until she tasted blood.

He knew.

He had known all along.

"Emily, look! These kudzu roots can still be replanted!" Ethan Miller pointed excitedly at the freshly dug roots.

Emily Johnson took the two dirt-covered yams, her eyes lighting up. "These are wonderful."

"Then... you can have them." Ethan scratched his head, his tanned cheeks flushing red.

"I can't just take them." Emily turned and went inside, returning with half a pound of dried noodles. "Here, trade you for these."

Ethan's eyes widened. "No way! If you hadn’t told me where to find them in the mountains, I wouldn’t have gotten anything!"

"Take it." Emily shoved the noodles into his arms without another word. "These yams are good for digestion—just what I need."

Ethan tried to protest, but Emily had already shut the courtyard gate with a bang. Clutching the noodles, he scurried home like a thief.

"Hide them well—don’t let anyone see," Emily’s voice called from behind the door.

Just as Ethan rounded the corner, he collided with his nephew, Little Tiger.

"Uncle, what’s in your shirt?" The sharp-eyed boy noticed the bulge in Ethan’s clothes.

"N-nothing!" Ethan hastily covered his chest and bolted away.

Little Tiger sprinted home. "Mom! I saw Uncle Ethan coming out of Emily’s place with something hidden in his shirt!"

"Something good?" Ethan’s sister-in-law perked up. "Let’s go check!"

Meanwhile, Emily was storing the newly bought yams alongside the ones Ethan had given her when David’s voice rang out from the yard. "Mom! Someone’s stealing from Ethan’s house!"

"What?" Emily nearly dropped the yams.

"It’s Little Tiger’s mom! She’s rummaging through Ethan’s place with her kids!" David stomped his foot in frustration.

Without hesitation, Emily grabbed the broom by the door and charged out, trailed by a crowd of curious children, heading straight for Ethan’s house.

The rickety gate of Ethan’s home stood wide open, the sound of drawers being yanked and cabinets overturned echoing from inside.

"STOP RIGHT THERE!" Emily’s sharp shout made the three intruders freeze.

Ethan’s sister-in-law clutched the stolen noodles, her face pale. "E-Emily..."

"What do you think you’re doing?" Emily brandished the broom, her voice icy.

Little Tiger hid behind his mother, muttering, "We... we were just looking..."

"Looking for things to steal?" Emily scoffed. "Ethan’s not home, so you think you can just help yourselves?"

Ethan’s sister-in-law swallowed hard. "I-I’m his sister-in-law..."

"And that gives you the right to rifle through his belongings?" Emily stepped closer, her glare sharp. "Put. It. Back."

The noodles thudded to the ground. The woman grabbed her children and tried to slip past.

"Not so fast." Emily blocked the doorway. "We’re not done here."


###Chapter 129: A Ten-Dollar Settlement

"Ten dollars, and we'll call it even."

Emily Johnson slapped the crumpled bill onto the table with a sharp smack. She had deliberately worn an old shirt today, its cuffs frayed at the edges.

Across from her, Manager Wilson narrowed his eyes, drumming his fingers on the desk. "Miss Johnson, are you trying to insult me?"

"Manager Wilson," Emily leaned forward slightly, "the surveillance footage clearly shows it was your supermarket's shelf that collapsed and damaged my bag. This is a limited-edition piece. Charging you just ten dollars for cleaning is more than generous."

Wilson's lips twitched. He knew exactly why that shelf had given way—it should've been repaired last week, but he'd delayed it to cut costs.

"Twenty," he ground out through clenched teeth.

Emily chuckled softly and pulled a photo from her bag. "I took this at the scene. It clearly shows the loose screws at the base of the shelf. Imagine if this went viral..."

Wilson's face paled instantly. He yanked open his drawer and grabbed a handful of change. "Fine! Ten it is!"

Emily leisurely tucked the money away. As she turned to leave, she added casually, "Oh, and you might want to fix those shelves soon. Next time, it might not just be a bag that gets hit..."

She left the sentence hanging, leaving Wilson alone in his office, wiping sweat from his brow.

Outside the supermarket, Emily pulled out her phone and texted her best friend: "Done. You're buying dinner tonight."

Her phone buzzed immediately: "That trick again? How many times is this now?"

Emily grinned as she slipped the ten-dollar bill into her wallet. She'd been using this strategy for three years—and it had never failed her yet.

BANG!

Emily Johnson shoved the door open with such force that the wooden panel slammed against the wall. The three figures inside froze mid-motion, caught red-handed.

"What are you doing?" Emily's voice cut through the air like a blade.

Margaret Wilson flinched, the iron pot slipping from her grasp and clattering to the floor.

"W-we were just visiting Ethan..." she stammered, her face pale.

"Liar! You were stealing!" David Stone planted his hands on his hips and glared.

Tommy piped up in his tiny voice, "We saw you!"

Margaret's two sons shrank against the wall, not daring to breathe. Everyone knew how formidable Emily was—hadn't she been the one to send Peter Wilson to jail?

Emily narrowed her eyes. "Want to settle this privately? Ten dollars."

"Ten dollars?!" Margaret shrieked.

"Or we can take it to the brigade leader," Emily said coolly.

"I'll pay!" Margaret spat through gritted teeth. "But I don't have it on me—"

"Go get it." Emily pointed to the door. "Your boys stay here."

The two teenagers panicked. "Mom!"

Margaret shot them a warning look. "Stay put!" Then she bolted outside.

The yard fell silent. The boys hunched their shoulders, stealing nervous glances at Emily.

"Thinking of hitting me?" Emily asked suddenly.

"No! Never!" they yelped in unison. As if they'd dare—not with Michael Stone's fists backing her up.

Tommy dragged over a stool. "Sit, Mama."

Emily sat, perfectly composed. Within half an hour, Margaret came panting back, clutching crumpled bills.

"Count it," she thrust the money at Emily.

Emily took her time verifying the amount before waving them off. "Go."

Once the trio slunk away, Emily turned to the children. "Come on, let's go home for cookies."

That afternoon, Ethan Miller had just come down from the hills when David called out to him.

"Emily wants you?" Ethan blinked in confusion.

Emily pressed the ten dollars into his hand. "Your sister-in-law tried stealing. This is compensation."

Ethan's eyes widened. "But—"

"Keep it." Emily smiled. "Should help you get some proper supplies."

Ethan clenched the money, his eyes suspiciously bright. This wasn't just ten dollars—it was the warmth of someone standing up for him.


###Chapter 130: Warmth in the Cold Winter

Ethan clutched the crumpled ten-yuan bill, his fingers trembling slightly. To him, this money meant survival.

"Sister-in-law, I'll remember your kindness." Ethan's voice choked with emotion. He knew Emily was protecting him.

Ten yuan—enough to make that greedy sister-in-law of his ache for quite some time. At least she'd stay quiet this winter.

Just as he stepped out of the Stone family compound, he nearly collided with Michael returning with firewood on his shoulder.

"Third Brother..." Ethan hung his head like a guilty child.

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Problem?"

Inside, David and Tommy had already chattered about the incident. After hearing the story, Michael smirked coldly. "Serves her right."

That ten yuan would surely keep that woman awake at night with regret.

True enough, Ethan's sister-in-law lay moaning on the kang, skipping lunch entirely. His brother squatted by the door smoking his pipe while their two sons huddled silently in a corner.

"That girl came by earlier," Emily said while knitting. "I asked her to help with this sweater and gave her some patterned fabric as payment."

Michael wasn't surprised. Before her memory loss, his wife could barely hold a needle—no way she'd suddenly master knitting now.

"Amy Bright—that's the name Samuel gave his sister." Michael sighed. "Poor kid."

Emily's hands stilled. Amy Bright? That name appeared in the original story!

Suddenly she remembered: come spring, Amy would be tricked by human traffickers and disappear without a trace. In those times, the fate of abducted girls was unthinkable.

"Sweetheart?" Michael noticed Emily had gone pale.

Emily snapped out of it and changed the subject. "Ethan's still wearing thin clothes and straw sandals. How will he survive winter? He brought some yams today, so I gave him half a pound of noodles."

Michael's expression darkened. Why did his wife keep worrying about other men?

"Mountain kids are tough like that," he said, a hint of jealousy in his tone. "Ethan's resilient—won't freeze to death."

Emily didn't press further. She knew supplies were scarce these days, cotton especially precious. She'd keep watching—if things got dire, she'd find a way to help.

Since that night they'd shared a bed, Michael had permanently moved into the main room. Their days passed quietly yet warmly.

Soon, the new houses for Robert and William's families were complete. On moving day, both households threw lively feasts.

Emily arrived bearing gifts—a bag of sugar and two pounds of dried noodles for each family. By village standards, this was exceptionally generous.

"Oh, sister-in-law, you're too kind!" Elizabeth Stone beamed, clasping Emily's hands with praise.

Patricia Stone insisted they stay for dinner. Surrounded by both families, Emily maintained a polite smile throughout.

Only Michael noticed how his wife's gaze kept drifting toward the courtyard—where Ethan sat against the wall in his threadbare clothes, chewing on a cold bun.
###Chapter 131: The Sister-in-law

As soon as Emily Johnson stepped into the yard, the children immediately greeted her in cheerful voices, "Hello, Aunt Emily!"

Even the usually mischievous Richard and George Jr. called out politely, their eyes darting toward Michael Stone—their uncle was watching them closely.

"Mommy!" Tommy was the first to throw himself into Emily's arms.

The Stone household was livelier than usual today. At a glance, Emily spotted the relatives of Elizabeth and Patricia gathered in small groups, chatting in the yard.

"Who is that young lady? She's so lovely—perfect for my nephew," remarked Patricia's sister-in-law, her eyes lighting up as she pointed at Emily.

Having missed George Jr.'s full-month celebration, she had never met Emily before.

"That's your sister-in-law. She's already married with children."

"What? That troublemaker's wife?" The sister-in-law's eyes widened. "She looks like she's never had kids—prettier than any city girl."

"She was an educated youth."

Finally understanding, the sister-in-law nodded. No wonder she carried herself so elegantly.

Unaware of the whispers, Emily found a quiet corner to sit. If not for the housewarming celebration for Robert and William, she wouldn't have come at all. The subtle, scrutinizing gazes made her uncomfortable.

"How does Emily keep getting more beautiful?"

"No wonder Michael is so smitten—he won’t even let her work in the fields."

"Shh! Keep your voice down unless you want trouble from Michael!"

The murmurs abruptly stopped. Everyone knew Michael's temper. They were here for the feast, not to provoke him.

"Sweetheart, come sit here." Michael strode over and pulled Emily to a different seat without hesitation. Seeing her sitting alone made his chest tighten.

"Don’t you need to entertain the guests?"

Michael glanced around the yard. "Today’s about Robert and William—they can handle it."

He had already decided to take Emily home after the meal. Since it wasn’t their housewarming, there was no need to linger.

"Michael, I heard you’ve been making good money outside. How about bringing your cousin along?" A man in his thirties approached—Michael’s second cousin from his maternal uncle’s side.

"Who’s been spreading nonsense?" Michael scoffed. "If I had money, I’d have moved Emily to town long ago. Why would I let her suffer in the village?"

The cousin stole a glance at Emily. His little cousin’s wife was indeed stunning, her fair skin glowing—clearly untouched by farm work.

"Anything else?" Michael’s gaze turned sharp.

The cousin’s back chilled. "N-no, nothing!" He quickly retreated. For someone who looked refined, Michael’s stare was downright intimidating.

"Auntie, your youngest daughter-in-law has no manners. She doesn’t even greet people," Mary’s sister-in-law remarked snidely, her eyes cutting toward Emily.
###Chapter 132: She Did It for Him

The brand-new cotton-padded clothes Emily wore didn’t have a single patch—clearly, they were freshly made.

Elizabeth Stone, Michael’s eldest aunt, remarked with a sneer, "Oh, Mary, your daughter-in-law sure has airs. She didn’t even greet her elders."

Mary Stone suppressed her irritation and explained, "Elizabeth, Emily might not have recognized you. I’ll have her come over later to properly meet everyone."

Her words were perfectly reasonable.

But Elizabeth wouldn’t let it go. "Mary, your daughter-in-law has no manners. Not even a smile for her elders—does she even respect us?"

Mary’s heart sank. No matter what, Emily was the mother of her grandsons and the wife of her beloved youngest son.

"We have many guests today. Emily’s busy attending to others. Please be understanding."

"Understanding?" Elizabeth scoffed.

"Sister, you sit here for now. My in-laws have arrived—I need to greet them." With that, Mary turned and walked away briskly.

She was fuming inside, but today was a joyous occasion. She couldn’t make a scene.

Elizabeth stamped her foot in frustration and immediately complained to William’s wife, "Look at Mary! Ever since her in-laws passed, she’s stopped caring about us! And that daughter-in-law of hers is downright disrespectful!"

William’s wife was far shrewder.

Mary’s family was doing better by the day—her son-in-law was the brigade leader. Her youngest grandson’s family lived in a brick-tile house, and Emily’s parents often sent money and gifts.

"Elizabeth, let it go," William’s wife advised. "Today’s a happy day."

Mary circled the gathering and found Emily, who was busy greeting guests.

"Emily, don’t you recognize your aunts? Have Michael introduce you properly." Without waiting for a response, she left, leaving Emily bewildered.

Michael immediately understood. His aunts must have complained to his mother, accusing Emily of disrespect.

My wife lost her memory—she doesn’t even remember me, let alone those aunts, he thought.

"How many aunts do you have?" Emily asked curiously.

Michael explained, "Three. After Grandma and Grandpa passed, Mom only visits them during the New Year."

Emily nodded. She understood—when parents were gone, family ties naturally weakened.

"Introduce me to them."

Michael was surprised. "You want to meet them?"

"Yes. I can’t keep pretending I don’t know them."

Warmth spread through Michael’s chest. She was doing this for him.

"This is Uncle Robert."

"Hello, Uncle Robert."

Robert Stone studied Emily and smiled approvingly. "Michael’s a lucky man. His wife’s as lovely as the day they married."

"This is Uncle William."

"Hello, Uncle William."

"And this is Uncle Daniel."

"Hello, Uncle Daniel."

Emily followed Michael’s lead, greeting each uncle with polite but distant smiles. At least now she knew who they were.

###Chapter 133: Showing One's Edge

Michael Stone held Emily Johnson's hand as they went to greet his aunts.

Aunt Elizabeth, the eldest, gave Emily a sidelong glance, her lips pursed. "Well, I thought little Michael had forgotten all about me. Took you long enough to show up."

Her tone dripped with accusation, implying they lacked manners.

Michael remained unruffled. "We're guests today too. I assumed you'd grown too important to bother with poor relatives like us."

With that, he tossed the blame right back at her.

Emily suppressed a smile. "Aunt Elizabeth, I saw you a few years ago, but I barely recognized you just now. If Michael hadn’t introduced us, I wouldn’t have dared to approach. You’ve got a few more wrinkles—must be all that family stress."

She paused meaningfully. "But as they say, children have their own blessings. Look at my in-laws—they let us live independently early on, and now they don’t have to worry about a thing."

Aunt Elizabeth’s face turned ashen, her lips trembling with rage.

Aunt Patricia, the second aunt, gaped.

This niece-in-law seemed sweet and gentle, but her words were sharp as knives.

A flicker of amusement crossed Michael’s eyes.

When he’d first married, Aunt Elizabeth had spread plenty of gossip—how city girls were too delicate for hard work, how they’d never bear sons.

Now, not only had his wife given him two healthy boys, but she’d also left Aunt Elizabeth speechless.

"How dare you speak to your elders like that?" Aunt Elizabeth finally choked out.

Emily blinked innocently. "Oh dear, my memory must be failing me. The truth can be so harsh sometimes. Don’t take it to heart, Aunt Elizabeth. It must be all that hard work—those crow’s feet are getting deeper by the day."

"You—you—!" Aunt Elizabeth pointed a shaking finger at her.

"Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Patricia, Aunt Margaret," Michael smoothly interjected, "there are many guests today. We should go greet the others. Apologies if we’ve been less than attentive."

With that, he quickly steered Emily away.

Once they were out of earshot, Michael squeezed her hand. "Well done, sweetheart. Keep standing up for yourself—don’t let anyone push you around."

Emily arched a brow. "You don’t mind me talking back to your elders?"

"Mind?" Michael chuckled. "When I was a kid and my cousins bullied me, Aunt Elizabeth always said it was just boys being boys. But once I grew up and started hitting back, she suddenly had nothing to say."

Emily burst out laughing.

So her husband had a long memory for grudges.
###Chapter 134: The Food Battle

"Mom, I'm hungry," little Tommy tugged at Emily Johnson's sleeve, his eyes fixed on the braised pork belly that had just been placed on the table.

Before Emily could react, seven or eight pairs of chopsticks lunged toward the plate. In the blink of an eye, only a layer of glistening oil remained.

"That was way too fast!" She gaped in disbelief.

Michael Stone, quick as lightning, managed to snag a piece of meat from the chaos and swiftly dropped it into her bowl. "Eat up. Any slower and it'll be gone."

Emily looked down at the lone piece of meat in her bowl, then at the villagers devouring their food around her. A pang of sadness struck her heart.

"Sweetheart, stop staring. Eat," Michael urged, placing a piece of fish in her bowl. "I caught this from the river."

The moment the fish touched her tongue, Emily noticed the difference—firm, fresh, far better than anything bought in the city.

"Good?" Michael leaned in and whispered.

She nodded, but when she saw him reaching for more food, she grabbed his arm. "You eat too. Don't just focus on me."

"I'm used to it," he grinned. "Couldn't win fights for food as a kid. Now I finally can."

The words twisted Emily's heart. Memories of the original owner's abuse toward Michael flooded her mind, and her fingers tightened around her chopsticks.

"What's wrong?" Michael noticed her sudden tension.

"Nothing," she forced a smile. "Just... thinking how hard things must've been for you."

Michael blinked, then chuckled. "Having you and the kids now makes it all worth it."

Amid the noisy chatter of the feast, his words rang clear in Emily's ears. Her nose stung, and she quickly lowered her head to hide behind her bowl of rice.

"Mom, I'm full," David wiped his mouth and took Tommy's hand. "I'll take my brother out to play."

"Go ahead, but don't wander too far," Emily reminded them.

Watching the boys run off, Michael suddenly said, "Let's head back too."

"Now?" Emily glanced at the still-bustling feast.

"You barely ate anything," Michael stood up. "I'll make you something good at home."

Admittedly still hungry, Emily followed him as they left early.

On the way, Michael asked, "You're not used to fighting for food, are you?"

"A little," she admitted honestly. "In the city, everyone eats at their own pace."

"That's just how it is in the countryside," he said calmly. "Food is precious. The quickest hands get the most."

Emily suddenly understood why Michael was so skilled at grabbing food—it was a survival skill honed since childhood.

Back home, Michael immediately got to work. He dug out his treasured powdered milk and made her a warm cup.

"Have this to tide you over. I'll go buy a chicken to make soup."

Emily cradled the steaming cup, warmth spreading through her chest. This man, who hadn't eaten his fill either, still thought of her first.

Within half an hour, Michael returned with a plump hen. He deftly slaughtered and plucked it, shooing Emily out of the kitchen when she tried to help.

"Go rest. The fumes are strong in here."

Soon, the rich aroma of chicken soup filled the yard. Sitting outside, listening to the clatter of pots and pans, Emily felt an unexpected sense of peace settle over her.

"Mom, it smells amazing!" David and Tommy came running back, drawn by the scent.

"Your dad's making chicken soup," Emily ruffled their hair. "We'll have a good dinner tonight."

At the table, the family gathered around two simple dishes—yam and chicken stew, and stir-fried chicken giblets—yet they brought more satisfaction than the extravagant feast earlier.

"Slow down. No one's fighting you for it," Emily laughed as she watched the three of them wolf down their food.

Michael ladled her a bowl of soup. "Drink more. It's good for you."

That night, lying in bed beside Michael's steady breathing, Emily's thoughts swirled. This man, despite all the suffering he'd endured, still treated others with kindness.

The next morning, Michael set off into the mountains with his brothers.

"Be careful," Emily handed him hand-drawn sketches of medicinal herbs she'd stayed up all night preparing. "If you see any of these, bring them back."

Michael carefully tucked away the drawings and pressed a light kiss to her forehead. "Wait for me."

Watching them disappear into the distance, Emily suddenly had a feeling—this trip might change their fate.
###Chapter 135: The Sweaters Arrived Too Soon

"I heard someone from the brigade found wild ginseng in the mountains," Michael Stone whispered.

Emily Johnson's eyes lit up. "We should keep an eye out for that. Maybe we should try our luck in the woods too."

The group exchanged glances, all aware of the value of such wild treasures.

"Come back early," Emily called from the doorway as she watched them leave.

With a soft sigh, she turned back inside. The two boys were unusually well-behaved today, staying home instead of running off to play.

"Mom, I'll keep you company," David said, sidling up to her.

"Me too!" Tommy chimed in, not wanting to be left out.

The weather had turned chilly, and both boys were already bundled in thin cotton-padded jackets—thermal underwear underneath and new outer layers. David’s coat from last year no longer fit, so it was passed down to Tommy. But Emily hadn’t brought herself to dress the younger boy in hand-me-downs just yet.

The children had grown noticeably taller. Emily couldn’t help but sigh—children in this era developed slowly, a clear sign of poor nutrition.

"Go read your books," she said, ruffling their hair.

The three of them settled into quiet reading until a knock interrupted the silence.

"I'll get it!" David jumped up.

At the door stood Amy Bright, holding three brand-new sweaters in her arms.

"Mom, Amy’s here!" David announced excitedly.

Emily hurried over and gaped at the sweaters. "You finished them already?"

It had only been a few days—how was this even possible?

"Sis, I finished the sweaters. Do you think they’ll fit?" Amy asked nervously.

Emily took them and examined the stitching—neat, even, and well-made. The style was lovely too. If they didn’t fit, unraveling and redoing the work would be a hassle.

"David, try yours on."

He shed his coat and pulled the sweater over his head. The neckline sat just right—not too high, not too low. Tommy’s was slightly roomier but still wearable. As for Michael’s, they’d have to wait for him to return to test it.

"They fit perfectly," Emily said with a satisfied nod. "Your brother’s should be fine too."

Amy finally relaxed. Not only had she finished the sweaters, but she’d also used the floral fabric Emily gave her to make a new padded coat.

"These socks are for you," Emily suddenly said, handing her a pair of nylon socks.

"I can’t accept these!" Amy waved her hands in refusal. "You’ve already given me so much."

"They pill easily, and I don’t like them," Emily insisted, pressing them into her hands. "I’ll come to you for more sewing work later."

Amy ran her fingers over the soft, stretchy fabric, warmth blooming in her chest. Nylon socks like these were something she’d never dreamed of owning before.

"Oh," Emily added in a hushed tone, "next time you go to town, let me know. You know how those village women treat me."

Amy nodded in understanding. The women resented Emily for not working in the fields and having a husband who doted on her.

"Don’t worry, Sis. I’ll definitely call for you when I go."
###Chapter 136: Acting Like Royalty

"The next trip to town probably won't be until the New Year shopping," Emily Johnson murmured, gently smoothing Amy Bright's hair with tender fingers.

She suddenly leaned close to the girl's ear and whispered, "Remember to invite me along, Amy. I hate being lied to—understand?" Before the girl could react, Emily magically produced a handful of White Rabbit candies from her pocket. "Here, something sweet."

Amy, flustered by the sudden affection, clutched the candies and dashed home breathlessly.

"Grandma!" She burst into the house, recounting Emily's words verbatim before proudly opening her palm. "Look!"

Grandma Bright squinted at the seven or eight candies and felt her pulse quicken. This city girl was certainly generous.

"The village women resent Emily for not working the fields—it's natural they'd exclude her," Grandma Bright mused, picking up a candy to examine under the lamplight. "But if she's got your third brother wrapped around her finger, she must be clever. Visit her more often. Learn from her."

The crisp sound of unwrapping candy pierced the quiet room. As the sweetness melted on her tongue, Amy suddenly thought Emily was even sweeter than the candy.

Meanwhile, chaos reigned at the Lee household.

"Useless girl!" Old Man Lee swung a broom at his daughter. "Charles Clark dotes on you, doesn’t he? Why can’t you squeeze a dowry out of him?"

Margaret Lee cowered in the corner, her thin cotton coat covered in dust. She didn’t dare dodge—or even cry.

"Husband, if we don’t get the money soon, our eldest will go to jail," Mrs. Lee fretted, wringing her hands. "What’ll happen to the grandchildren then?"

Old Man Lee’s face darkened as he yanked Margaret up by the collar. "Beg Charles again. If you fail..." He smirked coldly. "Don’t blame me for finding you another solution."

When Margaret stumbled to the Clark residence, Mrs. Clark was dumping a basin of dirty water in the yard.

"Oh, look—the princess graces us!" Mrs. Clark jeered, deliberately splashing the filthy water at Margaret’s feet. "Three hundred for a dowry? What, are you made of gold?"

The gate slammed shut. Margaret stood frozen in the bitter wind, tears icing on her cheeks before they could fall.

Suddenly, she remembered Emily’s gentle smile as she handed Amy those candies.

Why was fate so cruel to some girls—and so kind to others?
###Chapter 137: A Desperate Choice

The river roared as Margaret Lee stood on the bank, her vision blurred by tears. The accusations from her family still echoed in her ears, cutting into her heart like knives.

"It's all your fault!"
"If you hadn't meddled, your brother wouldn't have..."
"How dare you come back?"

She clenched the hem of her shirt, her nails digging deep into her palms. It was her older brother who had done wrong, so why was everyone blaming her? Even the nieces and nephews she had raised looked at her with resentment.

Splash—

The icy water swallowed her whole. Margaret didn't struggle, letting the current drag her deeper. In her daze, she thought she saw the cold, indifferent faces of her parents.

"Someone jumped in the river!"
"Quick, save her!"

Shouts erupted from the shore. A swift figure plunged into the water and soon dragged the unconscious Margaret onto dry land.

"Isn't that the Lee family's daughter?"
"Get her to the clinic!"

As dusk fell, George Lee paced anxiously in the yard. His eldest son crouched in the corner, eyes shifting guiltily.

"Dad, why isn't Margaret back yet?"
"Shut up!" George glared at his son. "If it weren't for you..."

His wife peeked out from the house. "Maybe... we should check the Clark family?"

The aroma of dinner drifted from the Clarks' yard. The moment George stepped inside, Martha Clark unleashed a torrent of curses.

"How dare you Lees show your faces here?"
"My son left early this morning—who knows where your daughter ran off to!"
"Demanding such a high bride price? You might as well rob us!"

The door slammed shut, leaving George and his son standing speechless.

"Dad... you don't think Margaret..." The eldest swallowed hard.
"Shut your mouth!" George's face darkened. "We need to find her!"

A kerosene lamp flickered along the riverbank, but it never illuminated the familiar figure they sought.

Meanwhile, deep in the mountains, firelight danced inside a cave.

"Michael, this haul is great!" Daniel River excitedly counted the medicinal herbs.
"Thanks to Emily's sketches," Samuel Bright said as he deftly wove a basket.
"Hurry up—we need to head back before dawn."

Wild boars and goats lay bound and ready. The group packed up and slipped silently down the mountain under cover of night.

Under the moonlight, the Lee family's kerosene lamp still wandered along the riverbank—but the girl who had jumped would never return.
###Chapter 138: Mountain Harvest

Emily Johnson was sound asleep when a loud "thud" startled her awake. Her eyes flew open, and she rolled out of bed in one swift motion.

"Burglars?" Her heart pounded.

Apparently, sending Peter Wilson to jail hadn't been enough of a warning. If she caught them this time, she'd make sure they stayed behind bars for years.

"Michael, open up," a hushed voice called from outside.

It sounded familiar. Squinting in the dim moonlight, Emily could just make out several shadowy figures in the yard.

"An inside job?" She narrowed her eyes.

"Keep it down," someone whispered as the gate creaked open. Several figures slipped in stealthily, dragging something behind them.

Click— Emily suddenly flicked on her flashlight.

"Ah!" Daniel River nearly dropped what he was holding in fright.

"Emily..." Michael Stone's voice was weary.

Now she could see them clearly—covered in dirt, reeking of the wilderness.

"You're back?" She exhaled in relief.

"Hey, sis," they chorused.

Michael moved toward her but stopped, catching a whiff of himself.

"Go back to sleep. We need to head into town."

"At this hour?" Emily frowned. "At least eat something first."

She quickly stirred a large cup of powdered milk and dug out some egg cakes.

"Just something to tide you over." She set the food on the table and retreated to the bedroom—the metallic scent of blood was overwhelming.

"Sis is the best," Charles Clark said, diving for the food first. With his huge appetite, the dry rations in the mountains had left him starving.

"Everyone, eat up," Michael urged.

Though it wasn't enough to fill them, the warm milk chased away some of the chill.

"These cakes are amazing!" Daniel wolfed his down. "Just wish there were more."

"Enough for you?" Michael shot him a look. "You could eat ten pounds and still want more."

After the quick meal, Michael and Charles left for town, while Daniel and Samuel Bright went home to rest.

By the time Emily woke the next morning, Michael had already returned, freshly washed and with breakfast ready.

"Emily, eat," he said.

They'd sold one of the hunted animals the night before, and the money had been split. But the medicinal herbs wouldn't fetch a good price in town, so he planned to take Emily to the county seat instead.

"We're going to the county later," he announced.

"So soon?" Emily raised an eyebrow. Had they struck gold and were off to splurge?

"David, Tommy," Michael turned to the boys, "you'll have lunch at Grandma's today."

The two youngsters stared longingly at their parents. Though they wanted to go to the county too, they knew their father wouldn't take them.
###Chapter 139: The Secret of the Golden Finger

"Mommy, Daddy, come back soon," little David said with a pout, his voice sweet and childish.

Tommy leaned against the doorframe, tugging at the hem of his shirt. "Yeah, come back soon."

Emily turned to Michael, frowning slightly. "You didn’t sleep at all last night. Maybe we should go tomorrow?"

Was this man made of iron? He had worked all day yesterday, sneaked out to the black market at midnight, and still woke up early to make breakfast. And now he was ready to head to the county town, full of energy?

"We have to go today," Michael said, adjusting his scarf. "I’ll buy you a new winter coat while we’re there. The one you have is too thin—this winter’s especially cold."

"Too thin?" Emily nearly rolled her eyes. "It’s perfectly warm!"

"I’ll take the kids to Mom and Dad’s place."

"Wait!" Emily hurried into the inner room and pulled a few packs of cream-filled cookies from her PennyDeals space, stuffing them into a cloth bag. "For David and Tommy."

Once the three of them were gone, Emily sprang into action. She quickly placed an order in her PennyDeals shopping app: eight women’s watches and two men’s watches.

Should she bring her phone?

She hesitated, staring at the smartphone in her palm. This was her golden finger—what if she lost it?

"Better keep it hidden," she muttered, tucking the phone back into her PennyDeals space. Instead, she grabbed pepper spray, a collapsible baton, and a personal alarm, shoving them all into her handbag.

"Sweetheart, let’s go," Michael called from outside, now dressed and ready.

The moment they stepped out, they ran into a group of nosy aunties.

"Oh, where are you two lovebirds off to?"

"Taking my wife to the county town for a bit," Michael said smoothly, lacing his fingers with Emily’s.

"The county town?" The aunties’ eyes lit up. "Must be much bigger than our little town, huh?"

"Of course," Michael said with a grin. "Since it’s winter and things are slow, I thought I’d take her to see a movie."

"A movie?!" The aunties clicked their tongues in envy. The town’s film crew hadn’t visited their village in two years.

At the town station, they transferred to a long-distance bus. Emily instantly regretted it—the bumpy road made her feel like her organs were being rearranged.

"Sweetheart, you look pale," Michael said worriedly, pulling her closer. "Motion sickness?"

"This road needs repairs," Emily gritted out.

"They fix it every year, and it falls apart every year," Michael sighed. "Just hang on—it’ll be smoother once we reach the city."

Emily leaned against his shoulder, already calculating how to turn those watches into cash. This trip to the county town was going to be profitable.
###Chapter 140: Black Market Deal

"Ugh—"

As soon as she stepped off the bus, Emily Johnson heard the sounds of people vomiting all around her. She covered her nose, her brows furrowing in disgust. The rickety bus had jolted along the entire journey, the cabin reeking of nauseating gasoline fumes.

"You okay?" Michael Stone asked, steadying her with concern.

"I'm fine," Emily replied, forcing down her discomfort as she quickly moved away from the filthy scene. She had deliberately worn a dark blue cotton coat today to avoid drawing attention.

Michael lowered his voice. "I’ll go sell the ginseng at the black market. You head to the department store and look around."

Emily’s eyes lit up. This was exactly what she wanted.

"Alright, I’ll wait for you."

The two parted ways at the street corner. Michael disappeared into a narrow alley with practiced ease, while Emily strode straight toward the department store.

At the watch counter, she pretended to browse casually. The "Plum Blossom" and "Shanghai" brands—these outdated watches looked downright tacky to her. Her fingers brushed against the two exquisite wristwatches hidden in her sleeve, and a faint smile curved her lips.

"Ah, you still need ration coupons to buy a watch these days. How’s my son supposed to get married like this?"

The complaints of two middle-aged women nearby caught her attention. Emily’s eyes gleamed—this was her chance.

"Auntie!" she chirped, sidling up to them warmly. "I’ve been looking for you!"

The two women stared at her in confusion.

Emily lowered her voice conspiratorially. "I’ve got something good here—no coupons needed..."

Ten minutes later, in a quiet alley.

"See? This is the latest model." Emily rolled up her sleeve, revealing the dazzling watch on her wrist. The metal band glinted coldly in the sunlight, its intricate dial leaving the two women wide-eyed.

"T-this is way better than anything in the department store!"

Emily smiled sweetly. "My cousin brought them back from the city. Only two left."

She mentally calculated—this watch could fetch at least...

"How much, girl?" One of the women had already pulled out a handkerchief-wrapped stack of bills, eager.

Emily blinked innocently. "What do you think is fair, Auntie?"

She needed to test the waters first. After all, in these times, she wasn’t entirely sure how much grain a single watch could trade for.
###Chapter 141: Unexpected Deal

"This watch isn't waterproof, so it's cheaper. The waterproof one costs quite a bit more."

Before Emily Johnson could finish speaking, the two middle-aged women's eyes lit up.

"Waterproof?" One of them gasped, running her fingers over the watch face. "That's a rare feature."

"Girl, name your price."

Emily smiled faintly. "Auntie, this is my first time selling something so expensive. The regular one is 120, the waterproof one is 200."

The women exchanged glances—these prices were much lower than the department store's.

"Deal!"

After the exchange, Emily hurried away, heading toward the department store to wait for her next customer.

But just as she turned the corner, someone called out sharply.

"Stop right there!"

Emily's heart skipped a beat, her fingers instinctively tightening around the watches hidden in her pocket.

"What do you have in your hands?"

A stylish young woman stood before her, dressed in a cashmere coat and leather shoes, clutching an elegant handbag.

"Comrade, I don't understand what you mean," Emily replied, feigning calm.

The woman stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Don't play dumb. I know you've got good stuff. Come, let's talk over there."

Emily cursed inwardly. How had this woman noticed her?

"I only have one left. We can look at it here."

She lifted the edge of her coat, revealing an exquisite wristwatch studded with tiny diamonds.

The woman's eyes gleamed as she grabbed Emily's wrist. "Let's go somewhere quieter!"

They moved to a secluded spot.

"This is an imported watch, not cheap," Emily said, tilting her chin up. "At least 500."

"Five hundred?" The woman sucked in a breath, but her gaze remained glued to the watch.

This design was impossible to find in their small town—maybe not even in the provincial capital.

"I'll take it!"

As the transaction concluded, Emily suddenly pulled out a pearl hairpin from her pocket. "A free gift for you."

The woman froze. This hairpin would cost several dollars at the department store.

Seizing the moment, Emily quickly walked away, removing her headscarf as she scanned the area for Michael Stone.

"Where is he...?" She stamped her foot anxiously.

If she waited any longer, trouble might find her.
###Chapter 142: A Date in Town

Michael Stone hurried back with the money from selling the ginseng, spotting his wife standing alone in front of the department store from afar.

"Emily!"
He rushed toward her in quick strides, his voice brimming with urgency.

Finally, he had arrived.
Emily Johnson quietly let out a sigh of relief.

"Let's grab a meal first, then catch a movie, and finally come back to buy clothes," Michael said excitedly, mapping out their plans.

"Alright," Emily agreed with a nod. Standing in front of the department store any longer, she was starting to feel uneasy under the gaze of passersby.

Michael led her confidently toward the state-run diner. Pushing aside the thick cotton curtain, warmth greeted them as they stepped inside.

"Braised pork and stir-fried greens," Michael ordered briskly.

It wasn't mealtime yet, so the place was nearly empty. The server soon brought out steaming plates of food.

"Try this braised pork—it's delicious," Michael said, placing a piece in her bowl.

Emily took small bites, savoring the rare treat of eating out. But before she could finish her bowl of rice, she was already full.

"Give it here."
Michael naturally took her bowl and poured the remaining rice into his own, eating heartily.

Emily froze.
He was eating her leftovers?

In the upbringing she had known, leaving food uneaten was absolutely forbidden. Yet this man before her didn't hesitate, eating as if it were the most natural thing.

"What's wrong?" Michael looked up at her.

"Nothing," Emily shook her head, a strange feeling stirring in her chest.

Leaving the diner, Michael took her to the cinema. They bought sunflower seeds and sodas before settling into their seats.

The film playing was The Landmine Warfare, and the theater was mostly filled with young couples.

"Not having any seeds?" Michael leaned over to ask.

Emily shook her head. The plain sunflower seeds held little appeal for her.

Two hours later, the movie ended, and their sodas were finished. Emily smacked her lips—the soda was cloyingly sweet, clearly made with saccharin.

"Come on, let's go buy clothes," Michael said cheerfully, pulling her toward the exit.

"But didn't you say we were out of fabric coupons?" Emily asked, puzzled.

"We have some now. Let's go." Michael gave her a mysterious smile.

At the department store, Michael acted as if he wanted to buy out the entire place, pointing at various outfits for her to try.

"This cotton jacket looks great!"
"This cashmere sweater is nice too!"

Emily quickly stopped him. In the end, she only bought one cotton jacket, along with two pounds of sponge cake and a bag of malt extract.

"Will there still be a bus back this afternoon?" Emily suddenly thought to ask.

If not, they'd have to spend the night in town.

Meanwhile, back at the old house, David and Tommy Stone were staring eagerly at the door.

"Grandma, aren't Mom and Dad coming back today?" Tommy tugged at Mary Stone's sleeve.

Mary patted her grandson's head. "They'll be back before dark."

"That long?" Tommy pouted. When they went to town before, they always returned by noon.

"Town is much farther than the village," Mary reassured him.

David held his little brother's hand tightly. "Mom and Dad won't leave us."
###Chapter 143: Rather Cook Than Babysit

"Mom, Tommy's crying again!" Emily shouted from the living room.

In the kitchen, Sophia was busy stir-frying vegetables, her apron tied securely around her waist. The range hood roared loudly as she replied without turning around, "Let him cry. It’s good for his lungs."

"But he's been crying for ten minutes already!" Emily stomped her foot impatiently.

Sophia calmly sprinkled salt into the pan. "Perfect. Another ten minutes, and dinner will be ready."

Emily huffed and stormed into the kitchen. "Can’t you just comfort him first?"

"Comfort him?" Sophia turned down the heat and raised an eyebrow. "Who’s going to cook, then? Your father’s away on business, and you can’t even make scrambled eggs. If I don’t cook, we’ll all go hungry tonight."

"But—"

"No buts." Sophia swiftly plated the vegetables and handed the dish to her daughter. "Take this out. Either you go comfort him, or let him keep crying. Frankly, I’d rather cook ten meals than babysit for a single minute today."

Emily gaped. "What kind of logic is that?"

"It’s called survival wisdom." Sophia wiped her hands. "Remember, the woman who controls the kitchen holds the power in the house."

Just then, Tommy’s crying stopped abruptly. They peeked into the living room to find the toddler happily gnawing on the TV remote.

"See?" Sophia smirked. "Kids stop crying when they’re tired. Now, we can eat in peace."

Emily: "......"


"Waaah—" Tommy's wail shattered the quiet of the yard.

David's words struck like a knife, hitting his little brother's deepest fear. Tiny fingers clutched desperately at his brother's sleeve as tears streamed down his flushed face.

Mary Stone nearly dropped her chores. "Goodness, what's all this crying about?"

"Grandma," Tommy hiccuped, "did Mommy abandon us?"

John Stone Sr. barely stepped into the courtyard before the commotion sent him striding inside. "What's going on here?"

"It's about Michael and Emily's trip to town," Mary sighed, dabbing at Tommy's cheeks. "The boys think their parents aren't coming back."

John frowned. "Nonsense! They just went to sell some mountain goods."

But David's eyes glistened too. "It's getting dark... They're not home yet..."

"Probably stayed at the inn." John glanced at the fading light, uncertainty creeping into his voice.

Mary shot him a look. "Will you comfort them or make dinner?"

"Dinner!" John declared without hesitation, already retreating toward the kitchen. "I'd cook ten meals rather than deal with crying children!"

Mary produced her treasured malt candy. "Here, sweethearts. Mommy and Daddy will be back tomorrow."

Then David hiccuped through his tears. "Grandma... I want to wait at home."

"Home!" Tommy instantly echoed.

Two pairs of damp eyes pleaded as small hands tugged at Mary's sleeves. Her resolve crumbled. "Old man, I'm taking them to Michael's place!"

Clanging pots answered from the kitchen. "Dinner's almost ready!"

"Eat it yourself!" Mary called back, already leading the boys out.

Beyond the gate, twilight deepened. Three elongated shadows stretched across the dusty path.


###Chapter 144: Waiting at the Threshold

The setting sun cast its final golden glow over the blue-gray tiles of the courtyard. I sat motionless on the threshold of the main hall, my hands folded neatly in my lap, fingers absently tracing the hem of my skirt.

The old locust tree in the yard stretched its mottled shadows across the ground, swaying gently in the breeze. Distant barks of dogs only deepened the quiet that enveloped the space.

"Young Mistress, you've been waiting for hours," whispered the maid, Xiao Cui, carefully offering a cup of tea.

I shook my head, my gaze still fixed on the courtyard gate. "Just a little longer."

The steam from the tea gradually dissipated, much like the fragile hope in my chest. As dusk settled, the distant sound of the night watchman's clapper echoed through the air.

Creak—

The gate finally swung open. I shot to my feet, my skirt knocking over the teacup beside me. The shattering of porcelain rang sharply through the twilight.

"You're back," I murmured, my voice trembling.

The figure stood silhouetted against the fading light at the gate, his expression unreadable. The night wind lifted the edges of his robe, carrying with it the scent of dust and fatigue.

"Hm." His reply was low and brief.

My fingers tightened around the handkerchief in my hand, knuckles whitening. This single word—was this all my day-long wait had earned me?

"Let's talk inside." He stepped forward, his boots striking the flagstones with deliberate clarity.

I didn’t move. As he passed me, a faint metallic tang—blood—lingered in the air.

"You're hurt?" I seized his sleeve abruptly.

Moonlight finally illuminated his face. The fresh scar running from his brow to his cheekbone sent a sharp pang through my chest.

"Stop that crying!" Captain John Stone Sr. barked, slamming his pipe onto the table. If this were his son bawling like this, he'd have whacked him with the pipe already.

But these were his two little grandsons.

"Grandma, I want Mommy..." Little Tommy sniffled, tugging at Mary Stone's sleeve.

Mary sighed and took both boys by the hand. "Come on, let's wait at your house."

As dusk fell, the village grew quiet. Most households had already eaten supper and retired early to save on kerosene. Mary led the children through the deserted lanes, unseen by anyone.

"Where's the key?" Mary crouched down to ask.

David fished out a red string from his padded coat, a brass key dangling from it. His small hands were red with cold, but he clutched the key tightly.

"Are you hungry?" Mary ruffled their hair.

"Not hungry," the brothers chorused, though their eyes remained fixed on the courtyard gate.

Without another word, Mary grabbed two enamel mugs from the table and mixed powdered milk. "Come drink this!"

Seeing their grandmother's stern expression, the boys obediently took the mugs. The warm, milky aroma was a small comfort against the winter chill.

Meanwhile, Emily Johnson and Michael Stone were rushing home. Their bus had broken down halfway, delaying them for hours. By the time they reached town, the last oxcart had long departed.

"Let's borrow a bicycle!" Michael decided instantly.

Emily clung to the backseat, the icy wind stinging her cheeks. She tightened her scarf, her thoughts fixed on the children.

"Mommy!" Two small figures barreled toward her the moment the gate opened.

Emily gathered them into her arms, their cold cheeks pressing against her neck. "Let's go inside, sweethearts."

Mary finally relaxed when she saw them return. "Your father's waiting for supper. I should head back."

"Mom, take this." Emily pressed a bag of malt extract into her hands.

With Mary gone, the house was quiet again. Michael rolled up his sleeves. "I'll make dinner."

After settling the children, Emily discreetly tucked the money from selling watches into the bottom of a chest. Today's trip had been fruitful.

"Mommy brought treats." She unwrapped a packet of egg cakes.

The boys' eyes lit up as they nibbled at the delicate pastries.

Soon, the kitchen filled with savory aromas. Michael worked efficiently, and before long, he brought out four steaming bowls of noodles with shredded pork.

"Meat!" Tommy cheered.

Emily's heart ached when she saw the generous heap of pork in her bowl compared to Michael's nearly bare noodles.

"Eat some too." She transferred a portion of meat to his bowl.

Under the dim glow of the kerosene lamp, the shadows of their little family stretched across the wall—warm and content.
###Chapter 145: The Priceless Treasure That Stunned Everyone

"What?" Su Wan's eyes widened in shock as her trembling finger pointed at the unremarkable jade pendant in the display case. "Eight million for this?"

The saleswoman maintained her professional smile and nodded gently. "Yes, madam. This is our store's most prized possession, crafted from the finest Hetian jade."

"Eight million..." Su Wan repeated the number under her breath, feeling as if the air had been knocked out of her. Her fingers instinctively brushed against her nearly empty wallet—she didn’t even have eight thousand to spare.

Beside her, her best friend Lin Xiaoyu gasped. "Good heavens, that costs more than my house!"

Unfazed, the saleswoman explained, "This pendant was once a royal treasure from the Ming Dynasty. The phoenix engraving was done by a master artisan, making it an invaluable collector's item."

Su Wan twisted her fingers nervously. She had only wanted to buy a decent birthday gift for her grandmother. Who knew that stepping into this quaint little jade shop would lead her to such an exorbitant treasure?

"Maybe... we should look at something else?" Lin Xiaoyu whispered, tugging at Su Wan’s sleeve.

Just then, the shop door swung open, and a sharply dressed man strode in. His piercing gaze swept across the store before settling on the pendant.

"That’s the one," his deep voice cut through the air like ice.

The saleswoman immediately straightened, her demeanor turning deferential. "Mr. Gu, we’ve been expecting you."

Su Wan and Lin Xiaoyu exchanged bewildered glances. This man didn’t even ask the price—he was ready to buy the pendant outright?

But what truly stunned Su Wan was when the man turned, revealing a face with sharp, striking features—it was Gu Chen, her high school sweetheart!

Five years had passed since she’d last seen him. How had he ended up here? And since when had he become... so wealthy?

Gu Chen’s gaze faltered for a fraction of a second when it landed on Su Wan, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. But just as quickly, his expression turned cold again as he ordered the saleswoman, "Wrap it up."

Su Wan’s heart clenched. Suddenly, she remembered her grandmother’s words—their family had once owned a precious heirloom jade pendant, lost during turbulent times. Its description matched this one perfectly...

"Wait!" The word burst from her lips before she could stop herself.

Night had fallen. Michael Stone tucked the blankets around his two sons with gentle hands before blowing out the kerosene lamp. As the dim glow faded, only the steady rhythm of breathing remained in the room.

Back in their own quarters, Emily sat by the bed, combing her long, raven-black hair that shimmered softly in the candlelight. Michael pulled a cloth bundle from his coat and carefully placed it on the bedside table.

"Sweetheart, I found two fifty-year-old wild ginseng roots in the mountains yesterday," he whispered. "They're worth a fortune on the black market—hard to come by. Since Charles and the others went with me, I figured we should split the profit."

Emily paused mid-stroke. She knew she hadn’t joined the hunting trip or helped forage, so she had no claim to the money. The earnings from selling the watch in town today were her own private stash.

"I don’t mind," she said simply, resuming her combing.

Michael gave her a surprised glance, expecting more discussion. But then again, his wife had always been reasonable.

"Alright, let’s get some rest."

Early the next morning, Charles Clark and the others barged in, full of energy. Daniel River had just slurped down the last of his porridge, chopsticks still in hand, when he blurted out, "Third Brother, how much did we get?"

Michael shot him a glare, and Daniel immediately shrank back.

"Pathetic," Michael muttered. "But I did hear something interesting."

"What?" Charles perked up.

Daniel lowered his voice dramatically. "Margaret Lee jumped into the river."

The room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Michael frowned. Between the mountain trip and the town errands, he’d only just caught his breath last night. Samuel Bright was even more exhausted—he’d slept till noon yesterday.

Charles’ bowl clattered onto the table. He’d gotten home late the night before last and slept until afternoon, so his family hadn’t mentioned a thing.

"N-no way..." Charles paled.

Samuel quickly intervened, "If something really happened, Old Man Lee would’ve come knocking by now."

Michael glared at Daniel. "No stew for you tonight."

"Third Brother, I’m sorry!" Daniel wailed, rushing to shut the door. When he turned back, his eyes nearly popped out—a stack of cash lay spread across the table.

"That much?" the three gasped in unison.

Michael counted the money leisurely. "The game brought in eighty. As for the two fifty-year-old ginseng roots..." He paused. "One sold for five hundred."

"Five hundred?!" Their collective inhale was sharp.

Samuel suddenly straightened. "Third Brother, if it weren’t for Sister-in-law’s drawings, we wouldn’t have recognized the ginseng. She deserves a share."

Daniel nodded vigorously. "Exactly! Without her guidance, we’d have trampled right over them like weeds."
###Chapter 146: Fleeing in Panic

Charles Clark scratched the back of his head, hesitating before speaking. "Shouldn’t... shouldn’t we give Sister-in-Law a share?"

The others nodded in agreement.

Michael Stone pondered for a moment. "This time, we’ll include her. But it won’t happen again."

Soon, a few crumpled bills were divided into small stacks.

"Charles, should I hold onto your share for now?" Michael eyed him carefully. He knew his friend too well—if left to his own devices, Charles might impulsively spend it all on an exorbitant dowry for the Lee family. Worse, since Charles hadn’t yet separated from his family, his elder brother and sister-in-law would surely catch wind of the money...

"Then I’ll keep twenty. You hold onto the rest for me, Michael." Charles rubbed his hands nervously. He was afraid his mother’s relentless nagging might wear him down.

Daniel River chimed in, "Michael, I’ll keep twenty too. Last time I hid money in the house, I couldn’t stop worrying about it."

Michael shot him a stern look. "Keep it safe. We’re heading out again in two weeks. Are you coming?"

The last trip had been to escape his wife’s arguments. But this time, when he returned, she seemed like a different person. He needed to earn more before winter set in—next year, when his wife took the university entrance exam, he’d have to establish a home for them in the provincial capital.

"I’m in!"
"Count me in!"

Only Samuel Bright remained silent.

"Samuel?" Michael frowned.

"I’m worried about Grandma and my sister..."

Daniel cut in, "What could possibly happen in the dead of winter? If there’s trouble, they can go to the village chief. And if that fails, there’s always Sister-in-Law!"

Michael’s expression darkened slightly.

"Then... I’ll go too." Samuel finally relented. He needed the money—for Grandma’s medicine, his sister’s dowry, and his own future marriage.

Once the money was distributed, the group dispersed, each lost in their own thoughts.

Charles grabbed Daniel’s arm. "Did Daisy really jump into the river?"

Daniel stomped his foot in frustration. "Don’t be an idiot! The Lees are nothing but a bottomless pit!"

"I just want to know if it’s true..."

"If something had really happened, the whole village would’ve heard about it by now." Samuel patted Charles’ shoulder reassuringly. "Don’t worry. She’s too clever for that."

After seeing the others off, Michael returned to his room and handed the money to Emily Johnson. "Here’s the profit from the ginseng sale. I set aside your share."

Emily froze. "I only want what’s fair. You keep the rest."

She remembered all too clearly—in the original story, this man would one day become the wealthiest man in the province. His startup capital couldn’t afford to be short.
###Chapter 147: Her Rescue

"Just your share from selling the ginseng?" Michael Stone frowned slightly, feeling a strange unease.

Was his wife trying to distance herself from him?

Why wouldn't she even take the money he earned?

"Now that policies have loosened, you can use this as capital to start a business," Emily Johnson said softly, her fingers unconsciously fiddling with the hem of her clothes.

Michael's eyes lit up. "You understand these things too, sweetheart?"

"I'll keep a portion for household expenses," Emily lowered her gaze. "When you make it big someday, you can give me more."

"Deal!" Michael grinned, pulling her into his arms. "Your man will make sure you live a good life!"

Resting against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat, Emily's eyes dimmed with hidden sorrow.

When he truly succeeded, would it be the gentle, lovely heroine from the book standing by his side?

"I believe in you," she murmured.

Carefully tucking away the money, Michael hummed a tune as he headed to their private plot to check on the turnips and cabbages.

......

At the clinic, Margaret Lee curled up on the hospital bed, where she'd been for two days.

She didn't dare go home.

The thought of her parents' twisted faces made her tremble.

"Girl, my son saved your life. You can't just forget his kindness," an elderly woman with deep wrinkles sidled up, her cloudy eyes fixed on Margaret.

Margaret bit her lip. Though she'd paled from staying indoors after the harvest, she was still plain-looking.

When she woke up in the clinic, she learned she'd been rescued by a worker from the meatpacking plant—a man in his thirties with a slight limp, whose first wife had died in childbirth.

"Auntie, I... I don't know how to repay him..." Her voice was barely audible.

The icy sting of the river at that moment had made her realize something.

Why should she pay for her brother's mistakes? Why was her bride price ten times higher than other village girls?

"Daisy," the woman rubbed her hands together, "on the way here, lots of folks saw you two. Word gets around, and your reputation..."

Tears welled up in Margaret's eyes.

Between sobs, she confessed about her family's exorbitant bride price demand.

The woman gasped. "That much? My son only makes thirty-something a month..."

"I'll marry him!" Margaret suddenly grabbed the woman's hand. "Don't tell my family!"

Going back would mean being sold off to some lonely old man or forced to jump into the river again.

At least this man who saved her had a steady job and a home.

Three days later, Margaret quietly followed the woman home. There was no wedding feast, no dowry—just a simple marriage certificate.

Meanwhile, the Lee family was frantically searching everywhere.

"Charles Clark! Hand over my daughter!" Old Man Lee kicked open the Clark family gate, his son in tow.

Charles grabbed a shovel, blocking the doorway. "I told you—I haven't seen Daisy!"

The father and son ransacked the yard in a frenzy until village officials arrived and dragged them away.

As night fell, Charles watched their retreating figures, his brow furrowed.

Where had Daisy gone?
###Chapter 148: The Lee Family's Desperate Scheme

Margaret Lee had been missing for days. The villagers whispered that the girl's reputation was ruined beyond repair.

Old George Lee paced anxiously outside the Clark residence, his only hope pinned on extorting money from them. Without it, his eldest son would end up in jail.

"Daisy! Come out!" George bellowed at the door.

Martha Clark stood firm, her expression icy. "She's not here."

Charles Clark shifted uneasily beside his mother. No trace of her for days... Could she really have drowned?

"Did anyone check the river?" he blurted.

Martha slapped his arm. "Don't be absurd!" She couldn't risk giving the Lees any leverage.

"But people are saying she jumped," Charles insisted.

George and his son exchanged uneasy glances. If she'd drowned, where was the body?

"Go search the river then!" Martha snapped. "Disgraceful—selling your own daughter for dowry money!"

The Lees slunk away, defeated.

"Father, if Daisy's really dead..." Jack Lee wrung his hands. "How will we pay my debts?"

George's eyes gleamed with cunning. "Blame that young widow for seducing you. If that fails, make her marry you to settle it."

The old man showed no grief—only greed.

Meanwhile, Charles sought out Samuel Bright.

"Sam, I think Daisy might have drowned," Charles said hoarsely. "The Lees came demanding answers again."

Samuel frowned. "Was her body found?"

"No." Charles shook his head. "Probably swept away."

His stomach churned. He'd only wanted a hardworking wife to start a family. Now this tragedy...

"Regretting not paying the dowry?" Samuel cut to the heart of it.

Charles fell silent. Guilt gnawed at him—a life lost because of their feud.

Rumors spread through Riverstone Village like wildfire. Some accused the Clarks of driving the girl to suicide, sparking outrage. As outsiders, the family had little standing to defend themselves.

(What twists await? Did Margaret truly perish? Can the Clarks clear their name? What underhanded plot will the Lees devise next?)
###Chapter 149: The Dowry of Thirty-Six Legs

"Margaret Lee's daughter—gone just like that?"

Emily Johnson's fingers trembled slightly around her teacup. The shrill cicadas outside couldn't drown out the chill creeping into her heart.

"Exactly," said Daisy Miller, slapping her thigh with a sigh. "The Clarks claim she jumped into the river herself. They never even found the body. And what did the Lees do? Went straight to the Clarks to demand the dowry money back—only to be chased out with brooms."

The teacup clinked against the table. Emily suddenly remembered the girl she'd once seen crying in the cornfield. Just a few months ago, she'd been alive...

"Honestly, the Lees were selling their daughter!" Daisy leaned in, lowering her voice. "Three Turns and One Sound, plus two hundred dollars? Even city workers couldn't afford that—they were setting impossible terms!"

Sunlight filtered through the window, casting fractured patterns on Emily's hand. The brightness suddenly felt harsh.

"That's not how bridal dowries work in our village, is it?"

"Of course not!" Daisy counted on her fingers. "Fifty to a hundred dollars, plus the Thirty-Six Legs—that's the proper way."

"Thirty-Six Legs?" Emily blinked. She'd only read about this in period novels.

"Four stools, one table, a wardrobe, a dresser, a writing desk..." Daisy recited like an expert. "Miss a single leg, and the bride won't even step into the wedding sedan!"

The sudden pounding of running feet interrupted them. David and Tommy Stone burst into the yard like little cannonballs, followed by Grace's son, Jack.

"Auntie!" The boys' eyes sparkled. "We finished our homework!"

Emily pushed aside her thoughts and pulled out an oil-paper package from the cupboard. The sweet aroma of cream-filled cookies filled the room, the children's laughter dispelling the earlier gloom.

"Take some for your sister too." She bent to ruffle Jack's hair when the gate creaked open.

Michael Stone stood at the entrance, holding a squawking hen, his pant legs splattered with mud.

"Wife, stew this for you—you need the nourishment." He grinned, shaking his prize.

Once the children ran off with their cookies, Emily leaned against the kitchen doorframe. "I heard about Margaret—"

"Dead." Michael deftly slit the hen's throat. "The Clarks say she drowned, but between you and me..." His voice dropped. "She might've been pushed."

Emily sucked in a sharp breath. Water bubbled in the pot, steam fogging her vision.

"If she's lucky..." Michael suddenly whispered in her ear, "she might be lying in some clinic right now, with no memory."

The words sent a jolt through Emily. Outside, the cornstalks swayed, and for a moment, she thought she saw the girl in the floral dress again.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the last golden light swept over the brand-new Thirty-Six Legs furniture. In the twilight, the wood grain looked eerily like streaks of drying blood.
###Chapter 150: You Take Care of Outside, I'll Handle Home

The first rays of morning sunlight filtered through the curtains when Emily Johnson was still curled up in her warm bed. Behind her, Michael Stone's steady breathing filled the air. She turned slightly, only for him to unconsciously pull her closer.

"Stop it..." she mumbled under her breath, though she couldn't suppress a small smile.

It wasn't until the excited shouts of their children echoed from the yard that she jolted awake.

"Mom! It's snowing!"

Emily sat up abruptly and pushed open the window. A biting wind carrying snowflakes rushed in, making her gasp. The world outside was blanketed in white, instantly clearing the last traces of sleep from her mind.

"When did it start snowing?" she murmured.

Michael's deep chuckle came from behind her. "Since midnight. You were sleeping like a log—no wonder you didn't notice."

She turned to glare at him, only to find him already dressed, adjusting his cuffs. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting sharp shadows across his chiseled profile.

"Go wash up. I heated water for you," he said without looking up.

Outside, their two boys were rolling in the snow. David, bundled in a new padded coat, looked like a little bear, while Tommy tilted his head back, sticking out his tongue to catch snowflakes.

"Mom! The snow is sweet!" Tommy exclaimed.

Emily's heart clenched. "Put your sweaters on!" She rushed over, scooping both children into the house.

"This sweater..." David ran his fingers over the soft fabric, eyes shining. "It's so warm!"

"It's cashmere," Emily said, kneeling to fasten their buttons. "Much warmer than cotton."

She didn't mention that she had secretly replaced their old, stiff coats with these from her hidden inventory. The original ones would never have withstood the northern winter.

Michael emerged from the kitchen carrying steaming breakfast, just in time to see the tender scene—his wife crouched by their children, sunlight gilding her hair as she helped them with their shoes.

"Breakfast's ready," he said softly.

At the table, Michael suddenly spoke up. "I'll be leaving on a trip in a couple of days."

Emily paused mid-bite. "How long?"

"Back before New Year's." He placed a slice of cured meat in her bowl. "You'll have to manage things here."

"You take care of outside, I'll handle home," she replied with a faint smile. "That was our deal, wasn't it?"

Michael's eyes darkened, his throat bobbing slightly. Hearing those words from her lips sent an unexpected warmth through his chest.

"About the fields—"

"I'll ask Dad to help," he cut in. "Just focus on yourself and the kids."

Emily nodded, though her mind was already calculating the supplies in her hidden stash. While he was away, she could bring out more useful items.

After breakfast, Michael left with Daniel River for the mountains. Emily was building a snowman with the boys when a knock sounded at the gate.

"Sister-in-law..." Elizabeth Stone stood at the door, wringing her hands nervously. Behind her, Grace and Jack peeked out timidly, their thin coats clearly too short at the hems.

Emily's heart sank. In this freezing weather...

"Is something wrong?" she asked gently.

Elizabeth bit her lip, her voice barely audible. "Could... could we borrow some cotton? The children's clothes..."

Before she could finish, Grace sneezed loudly. Emily took in the little girl's reddened cheeks, and something inside her softened.

[Foreshadowing: How will Emily help Elizabeth's family? What unexpected discovery will Michael make in the mountains? How will the hidden supplies change their winter?]
###Chapter 151: Help in Times of Need

"Grace's coat is already too short?" Elizabeth Stone looked at her daughter's reddened little hands, her heart aching.

Indeed, the cotton-padded coat had been worn for three years, patched over and over, barely providing any warmth. Glancing at her sons' brand-new coats, Elizabeth felt her eyes grow hot.

"Sister-in-law, I still have some cotton left—David's father brought it back from town last time," Emily Johnson said softly. "I can spare you about a pound."

Elizabeth's eyes lit up. Fabric coupons and cotton were rare commodities in the countryside. A pound of cotton would go a long way!

"Emily, what would you like in exchange?" Elizabeth rubbed her hands nervously. The family had spent all their savings building the house and still had debts to pay.

"Just some eggs will do," Emily smiled. "You can bring them over in a few days."

She turned and went inside, returning shortly with a fertilizer bag. When Elizabeth took it, she saw the cotton inside—pure white, cleaner than any she'd ever seen.

"Thank you, sister!" Elizabeth's voice trembled with gratitude. "I'll go home right away and make new coats for the children!"

"Mom, can I stay and play a little longer?" Grace asked timidly.

"Let them stay," Emily said, patting Grace's head. "Sister-in-law, I also have some fabric scraps. Would you like them?"

Fabric scraps? Elizabeth's eyes brightened even more. Country women were always short on fabric—even palm-sized pieces could be put to good use.

"Yes! Yes!" Elizabeth nodded eagerly.

When she saw the scraps, she nearly cried. These weren't just scraps—each piece was larger than her palm, and the colors were vibrant.

"Thank you, Auntie!" Elizabeth hugged the cotton and fabric, walking home with light steps. With some piecing together, she could make summer dresses for her daughters.

Inside, Grace and Jack were gazing at Emily expectantly.

"Here." Emily pulled out a few White Rabbit candies. "Don't tell your mom."

The children's eyes crinkled with delight.

Meanwhile, in the Bright family's courtyard.

"Brother, Sister-in-law said she wants to come along next time we go to town," Amy Bright said as she wove a basket.

Samuel Bright paused his work. "She doesn't have many acquaintances left in the brigade now that most educated youths have left."

"She's actually quite nice," Amy murmured. "Just quiet."

Samuel thought about the recent changes. Ever since his brother started earning money, his sister-in-law had indeed changed. Last time, he'd made over a thousand yuan on his trip, and now he'd earned several hundred more selling mountain goods.

Perhaps life really was getting better?
###Chapter 152: A Winter Expedition

The bitter winter wind howled through the mountains. In an era where the average worker earned only thirty dollars a month, Michael Stone’s recent earnings surpassed a decade’s wages for most.

"The New Year’s approaching. Take some time to go to town for supplies, and bring your sister-in-law along," Samuel Bright said, rubbing his reddened hands. "I’ll be heading out with Michael in a few days."

"Again?" Amy Bright’s heart tightened.

"We’ll be back before the holiday," Samuel exhaled into his palms. "Business is best around this time. If anything comes up, go to your sister-in-law. After what happened with Peter Wilson, no one in the village dares cross her."

Amy still couldn’t believe it—the delicate Emily Johnson had actually sent Peter to jail.

"I’ll remember, brother."

Samuel worked faster, eyeing their adobe house with determination. Next year, they’d build a proper brick-tile home.

Knee-deep snow crunched underfoot as Daniel River and Michael trudged forward, only to spot a familiar figure.

"Ethan? What are you doing out here in this weather?"

The thin boy, bundled in threadbare layers, clutched a few dry branches. His toes, exposed through straw sandals, were purple with cold. He lifted his head. "I was hoping to find some frozen game..."

Michael frowned. "Come with us."

The trio pressed deeper into the forest. Ethan hesitated before asking, "Michael, I dried some kudzu root powder. Does Emily still want it?"

"She does." Michael’s lips curved at the memory of the crystal dumplings she’d made with it. "She says you’ve got skill."

Ethan’s eyes brightened. The food she’d traded him had kept him fed all winter.

Luck struck unexpectedly—a wild boar herd crossed their path. Holding their breath behind a tree, they targeted a straggler. By the time they finished, the sun hung low.

Back home, Emily had just put the children to bed. The wind wailed outside as she prepared to extinguish the kerosene lamp—until a soft knock sounded at the gate.

"Michael?" Gripping the lamp, she steeled herself and opened the door.

Three snow-covered figures stood in the storm.

"Emily..."

"Sister-in-law!"

The two men and the boy were caked in snow, bloodied game in hand. Emily hurried them inside and bolted the gate.

"Mommy, is that Daddy?" Tommy’s sleepy voice drifted from the bedroom.

"Go back to sleep!" Emily hissed. "No one gets up, or you’ll be drinking bitter medicine if you catch cold!"
###Chapter 153: Unwavering Determination

"Have a bite before cleaning up."

Michael Stone wanted to persuade his wife to rest, but instead, he watched as she carried a kerosene lamp into the kitchen. In the dim light, she rolled up her sleeves and began preparing a meal.

"How about some dough drop soup?"

"Sis, I'll eat anything!" Ethan Miller tried to decline, but his stomach betrayed him with a loud growl.

"Good."

Emily Johnson swiftly chopped some pickled cabbage and stir-fried it in hot oil. The dough in her hands was kneaded and stretched, soon forming small dumplings that plopped into the boiling broth.

Since arriving in this era, this modern woman who had never lifted a finger in the kitchen had learned to cook simple meals.

The tangy, spicy soup warmed them up, beads of sweat forming on their foreheads as they ate.

"Sweetheart, leave the rest to us. You should get some sleep."

Emily glanced at the wild boar and rabbits on the floor—better not to witness the bloody aftermath.

"Alright..."

Michael patiently taught Ethan how to skin a rabbit, then gave him one as thanks. After seeing Ethan off, the brothers worked late into the night, salting the pork.

Michael scrubbed his hands three times with soap, making sure no trace of blood remained before slipping under the covers.

"Sweetheart, I'll go to town tomorrow for more salt. We're running low."

"How come—" Emily suddenly remembered last night's "spoils," animals that would be protected decades later.

"Go ahead."

At dawn, Michael headed to his parents' house with a basket.

"Mom, I'll be away for a few days soon. Emily doesn’t know how to make cured meat—could you help?"

Mary Stone sighed as she accepted the fresh pork from her son. "Fine, I’ll find time."

Life had grown quieter for the elderly couple since the family split. The malt extract their son had brought last time was now a daily treat—his wife had warned it would expire soon.

"Is your wife still studying?" Mary suddenly lowered her voice. "Is she taking the college entrance exam again next year?"

Why wouldn’t this girl give up?

"Yes. She’s certain she’ll pass. Then the boys and I will go with her to school."

"To the capital?" Mary’s voice rose sharply.

"That’s right."

Frustrated, Mary poked her son’s forehead. "You graduated high school too—why don’t you take the exam with her?"

"Mom, you know how little I actually learned back then..."

Watching her son’s sheepish grin, Mary shook her head in exasperation. He’d always been clever—why did he turn into a fool when it came to his wife?
###Chapter 154: Fooling Yourself Like This

"What if your wife gets into college and decides she's too good for a country bumpkin like you?"

Mary Stone chopped meat on the cutting board while side-eyeing her third son. She saw things clearly—that wife of his, with her delicate looks and refined air, didn’t seem the type to settle down quietly.

"Don’t worry, Ma." Michael Stone grinned, deftly turning the meat in his hands. "Emily’s good to me. She’s just a bit reserved, not the type for sweet talk."

"Hmph!" Mary snorted. "That’s how you fool yourself!"

Unbothered, Michael cheerfully arranged the marinated meat into a basin. "I’m heading to town for salt. I’ll grab Emily some snacks while I’m at it."

"Go on, then!" Mary waved her cleaver at him. "Just seeing you annoys me!"

Once her son was gone, Mary tucked two choice cuts of pork belly into the cupboard and polished the stove until it gleamed. She needed to visit her son’s house—see how this cured meat was supposed to be made.

More importantly, she needed to figure out what Emily was really up to. If that girl was planning to ditch Michael the moment she got into college, Mary would make sure that plan never saw the light of day.

"Mrs. Stone, you’re home alone?"

Emily Johnson, crouched in the yard cleaning pig offal, startled at the voice. She looked up to see her mother-in-law at the gate and quickly wiped her hands as she stood.

"Ma, you’re here. David and Tommy are out playing. Michael went to town for salt."

Mary scanned the yard. The snow hadn’t fully melted, and the cold wind nipped at her neck. She marched straight to the kitchen, frowning at the pile of meat on the counter.

"Michael asked me to help with the cured meat."

Emily trailed behind, her stomach knotting. She had no idea how to make cured meat—didn’t even know what kind of branches to use for smoking.

"Ma, I heard cypress branches are used for smoking?"

"Mm, with dried orange and pomelo peels too." Mary briskly tied on an apron. "Salt it for a few days first, then hang it to smoke."

"Then... thank you for your help, Ma."

Mary’s gaze landed on the pile of pork bones in the corner—some already salted, others still bloody. And that heap of offal? She doubted Emily’s soft hands had even touched it.

"How about sausages?" Emily suddenly suggested. "I bought the spices, but... I’m not sure how to stuff them."

Mary huffed. City girls and their fussiness. But seeing the hopeful look in her daughter-in-law’s eyes, she nodded.

The two women worked all morning—one chopping meat, the other mixing spices. By the time Michael returned, the yard was strung with rows of plump red sausages, and the rich aroma of bone broth bubbled from the stove.

"Sausages?" Michael’s eyes lit up. "You and Ma made these?"

Emily lifted her chin proudly. "Let’s invite Pa for lunch too."

Michael’s heart softened. He took over her task. "You two rest. I’ll handle the rest."

"Michael..." Emily tugged his sleeve, her voice sweet. "I was thinking of making spiced pork too, but... I don’t know if it’s marinated with soy sauce..."

"Do it!" Michael agreed without hesitation. "I bought all kinds of spices. Whatever you want, we’ll make it."

Mary rolled her eyes. The way these two fawned over each other was sickening even to a mother. But... that little pout of Emily’s really was hard to resist.

Fine. As long as the girl stayed loyal to Michael, Mary could afford to be a little kinder.
###Chapter 155: Out of Sight, Out of Mind

"Michael, let's try making spiced pork," Emily Johnson said, her bright eyes twinkling as she poked the slab of pork belly on the cutting board. "I heard we need soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, and cinnamon."

Michael Stone rolled up his sleeves, revealing his muscular arms. "Whatever you say, sweetheart. If it turns out bad, I'll eat it all."

Mary Stone sighed from the sidelines, feeling completely ignored by the young couple.

"Mom, don't leave yet!" Emily quickly stopped her mother-in-law from walking away. "Dinner will be ready soon. Michael, go get your father. I'll start cooking right away."

Hearing his wife call him "Michael," his lips curled into an involuntary smile. It sounded much better than "David's dad."

Soon, the rich aroma of braised meat filled the kitchen. Two little figures in new cotton shoes pattered inside.

"Mommy! It's so cold outside!" Tommy Stone threw himself into Emily's arms, his cheeks flushed red from the chill.

Mary immediately scooped up her grandson. "Oh, my sweet boy! That new coat looks so warm."

"Grandma, my feet are hot," Tommy wriggled, trying to kick off his shoes.

Emily caught his tiny hands. "No, you can't take them off—you'll get frostbite. Should we give them to Ethan next door instead?"

"No!" Tommy instantly tucked his feet back. "Mommy bought these for me!"

Meanwhile, David, ever the responsible big brother, tugged at his younger sibling. "Come on, let's go recite The Hundred Family Surnames."

Before long, childish voices drifted from the yard: "Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang..."

John Stone Sr. paused at the gate, surprised. "David can read now?"

"Emily taught him," Michael said with unmistakable pride. "She makes time every day to teach them letters and poems."

Mary watched her daughter-in-law bustling by the stove, her earlier irritation long gone. Sure, the girl was a bit pampered, but when it came to the children, her heart was in the right place.
###Chapter 156: The Overachieving Wife

"Grandpa! Daddy!"
"Grandpa!"

Two little bundles of energy came bouncing over. John Stone Sr. chuckled and waved them closer.

"Can you recite any poems?"

Tommy immediately puffed out his tiny chest. "Yes!"
In his adorable toddler voice, he began: "Hoeing millet under midday sun, sweat drips to the soil..."

The elder Stone's eyes lit up.
Not a single mistake from this three-year-old.

"How about you, David?"

David blinked his big eyes. "Mom taught us ten poems."
Without hesitation, he recited: "Leaving home young, returning old..."

In the kitchen, Mary Stone paused mid-stir.
When had her daughter-in-law found time for this?

"The Goose..."
"Thoughts on a Quiet Night..."

Tommy stomped impatiently. "I know this too! Red beans grow in southern fields..."
He stumbled halfway, substituting "May you gather" with "May Mommy gather."

David corrected him with solemn authority. "It's 'may you gather abundantly.'"
Tommy stuck out his tongue. "Oops, I forgot!"

Michael nearly dropped his teacup.
Since when was his wife this impressive?

"Mom promised to buy us a dictionary next time," David announced proudly. "She'll teach us phonics."
"Then I can read books all by myself!"

John Sr. looked thunderstruck.
If they knew this much before starting school, what heights would they reach?

"Can you count?"
David rattled off numbers to one hundred.
Not to be outdone, Tommy piped up with his rendition to fifty.

Mary emerged with steaming dishes, gazing at her grandsons with newfound wonder.
"Come eat now. Have extra meat—it's good for growing brains."

The aromatic braised pork made both boys' eyes sparkle like Christmas morning.
###Chapter 157: The Hidden Oil

The aroma of pork rib soup filled the kitchen, the seaweed tender and flavorful. Emily Johnson picked up a piece of seaweed and savored it slowly.

"Eat more meat," Michael Stone said, placing another rib in her bowl. He always thought his wife showed little interest in meat, even though these ribs were all lean cuts.

Mary Stone, chewing thoughtfully, mused, "Those organ meats taste best braised with spices. Or stir-fried with a rich sauce..." She caught sight of her son serving his wife and sighed inwardly.

This daughter-in-law was as pretty as a flower, still glowing even after bearing two children. Now she carried herself with such grace, almost like a proper lady. No wonder her son treasured her so much.

Emily thought of the braised pork intestines and spicy beef slices she'd enjoyed in her past life and swallowed hard. Those were considered delicacies in the 21st century.

"Let’s have dinner together tonight, Mom and Dad. These things won’t keep long."

Mary calculated, "After dinner, we’ll need to render the lard."

In these times, every household stretched their oil supply thin. A year’s worth of cooking depended on the small ration of lard they received.

The two little boys happily slurped their seaweed soup over sweet potato rice, as if it were the finest meal.

After dinner, Emily and Michael cleared the dishes while Mary stoked the fire to render the lard.

"I heard the neighboring brigade pressed a good amount of oil this year..." Mary chattered.

Emily suddenly spoke up, "Mom, I bought some oil in town last time. Would you like to take some home?"

She turned and retrieved a glass bottle from beside the water jar under the dresser. Golden rapeseed oil shimmered inside.

Mary’s eyes widened. What a clever hiding spot!

"Can you buy things in town without ration coupons now?" she asked skeptically.

"Some things don’t require coupons anymore," Emily explained. "But industrial goods still do."

Michael was stunned. He’d been home every day and never noticed the hidden oil.

"Mom, just take a bottle with you."

Mary looked at her son and daughter-in-law and suddenly smiled. "You two really know how to manage a household."

Michael took over the task of rendering the lard, insisting Emily rest. Watching her son work, Mary felt both proud and a little wistful.

This silly boy—he doted on his wife so much.
###Chapter 158: The Envy-Stirring Aroma of Cooking Oil

Gurgle, gurgle— The lard bubbled merrily in the pot as Mary Stone deftly skimmed off the foam. Carefully, she ladled the rendered fat into an earthen jar, then picked up a gleaming bottle of golden rapeseed oil, tilting it in the sunlight.

"Well now, Mary, that oil looks mighty fresh!" Patricia Stone, their neighbor, called out from behind the fence, her sharp eyes catching the glint.

Mary's lips curled with pride. "Sure is! Emily gave it to us. That girl may be quiet, but she’s always thinking of us old folks!"

"Emily Johnson?" Patricia's eyes widened. "Didn’t they just split from the family? Where’d she get so much oil?"

Mary deliberately raised the bottle higher. "Michael invited us over for meat today, and before we left, he insisted we take this. Oh, you should’ve seen the braised pork—so tender it fell apart at the touch of a chopstick..."

A few passing wives overheard and gathered around. The golden oil shimmered in the glass bottle, making their eyes gleam with envy.

"How much does that cost per pound?"
"Does Emily have any left?"
"My husband hasn’t tasted anything this rich in half a year..."

Mary basked in their eager questions. "I don’t know the price, but Emily said we could come back for more when we run out." With that, she swung her basket over her arm and hummed a tune as she walked home, leaving a trail of longing sighs behind her.

The news spread like wildfire, reaching Patricia’s ears in no time.

"William!" She yanked her husband back as he tried to leave. "Your brother’s family feasted on meat and didn’t even invite us! Do they even respect their elders?"

William swallowed hard. "After how things went down during the split, you really wanna show up uninvited?"

"I don’t care!" Patricia planted her hands on her hips. "Look at little Jack—skinny as a twig! Can you, as his uncle, just stand by?" Her eyes narrowed craftily. "Why don’t you... go borrow some meat? Doesn’t Michael hunt?"

William’s temper flared. He stormed off to his eldest brother’s house instead. Inside, he found Robert Stone planing wood, sawdust flying everywhere.

"Robert! Michael’s living high now—feasting on meat and leaving us out!" He embellished the story. "He even gave Ma and Pa a whole bottle of rapeseed oil!"

Robert’s plane hesitated. He remembered seeing David and Tommy yesterday—their round cheeks and brand-new coats, a stark contrast to his own sallow, thin children.

"I... I’m going to the hills." Robert suddenly set down his tools and grabbed the hatchet by the wall.

Inside, Elizabeth Stone pricked up her ears as she mended clothes. The needle darted through the rough fabric, her gaze lingering on her children’s threadbare sleeves. With a sharp tug, she bit off the thread.
###Chapter 159: Allergic to Romance

Robert Stone carried a hoe over his shoulder while William Stone followed behind with a hemp rope, the two brothers trudging through the snowy mountain path.

"Big brother, should we dig some traps?" William rubbed his hands together, blowing warm air into them.

Robert frowned. "William, have you ever hunted before?" He was a skilled farmer but a complete novice when it came to tracking game.

"Of course!" William lied through his teeth. Back when they all lived together, their youngest brother Michael had always been the one to bring home meat. Now that the family had split, they had to fend for themselves.

The mountain was still blanketed in snow, but many villagers had already come to try their luck. A fortunate few might snag a pheasant or even stumble upon a foolish rabbit.

"Emily, I’ll wash Tommy’s quilt tomorrow," Michael suddenly announced.

Emily Johnson paused while folding clothes. Washing bedding in the dead of winter? That sounded like self-inflicted misery.

"Emily," Michael moved closer, "could you stop calling me 'David’s dad'?"

She raised an eyebrow. Hadn’t she always called him that?

"Stone?" she tested the nickname.

Michael’s eyes instantly brightened. "I like that! Say it again."

Emily sighed. He was acting like a child. Once the female lead appeared in the future, he could call himself whatever he wanted.

"Stone," she repeated.

Michael grinned so wide his eyes nearly disappeared. "Your voice is so sweet."

Emily studied him suspiciously. This sudden flattery definitely had an ulterior motive.

"Emily, can I kiss you?" he asked, eyes pleading.

"No." Her refusal was firm.

Undeterred, he inched even closer. "You’re so beautiful."

"I know. I look in the mirror every day," she deadpanned.

Michael stubbornly grabbed her hand. "Your hands are so soft."

"All women’s hands are soft." She pulled away.

Before she could react, he quickly pressed his lips to the back of her hand. "And sweet."

"That’s just hand cream."

His face fell. Emily finally cracked, laughing. "Sorry, I’m allergic to romance."

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting dappled patterns on the floor. Watching his wife’s radiant smile, Michael thought—this was enough. A lifetime like this would be just fine.
###Chapter 160: I'll Stay With You

"This business trip might take a while, but I'll be back before the New Year," Michael Stone said softly.

Before the New Year?

"Bring back some local specialties," Emily Johnson mused.

Truthfully, she could buy anything on PennyDeals. But preservative-laden products could never compare to authentic, fresh goods.

Like free-range eggs—fried to a perfect golden hue. Or the rich aroma of home-raised chicken soup, something impossible to find in the twenty-first century.

She remembered her senior year of high school when her mother drove hundreds of miles just to get her real farm-raised chicken for nourishment.

"That's all?" Michael sounded surprised.

"Mhm." Emily nodded. "Don’t buy me clothes or shoes. Just bring some books for the kids."

That cashmere coat from last time was nice, but unnecessary.

Michael’s chest tightened. "You didn’t like it?"

"It’s not that I didn’t—" Before she could finish, warmth pressed against her lips.

"You—!" Her eyes widened.

"What? I’m kissing my own wife," Michael grinned like a cat that got the cream.

Emily’s ears burned as she playfully swatted at him.

"Sweetheart, read your book. I’ll stay with you," Michael quickly changed the subject.

"Let go!" She shook off his wandering hand.

That afternoon, Mary Stone came over to help stew a pot of soybeans and pork intestines, the savory scent filling the yard.

After dinner, Michael eagerly cleared the dishes. "I’ll handle this!"

The two little ones trotted after him, eager to help.

"Daddy, I can help Mommy!" Little David puffed out his chest.

"Me too!" Tommy chimed in, not to be outdone.

Michael ruffled their hair. "Good boys. I’ll bring you treats when I get back."

Standing at the kitchen doorway, Emily watched the three of them bustling about, a soft smile tugging at her lips.

Outside, the setting sun cast its final golden glow across the yard—warm and serene.
###Chapter 161: Search in the Mountains

The winter night was bitterly cold. Inside the Stone family's courtyard, everyone huddled around the firepit for warmth when a sudden, urgent knock shattered the quiet.

"Who is it?" Michael Stone set down the towel in his hands and strode toward the gate.

Outside stood eleven-year-old Lily, stomping her feet against the chill, her eyes red-rimmed. "Uncle Michael, my dad still hasn't come back..."

"Where did he go?" Michael frowned. In the dead of winter, most families stayed indoors—where could his eldest brother have gone?

"Mom said he went into the mountains with Uncle William, but it's already dark..." Lily's voice trembled with unshed tears.

Michael's chest tightened. The mountains? In this freezing weather? How could his responsible brother follow that reckless fool William into the wilderness?

"Don't worry, Lily. I'll go find them." He turned back toward the house. "Go home and tell your mother not to panic."

Emily Johnson, hearing the commotion, emerged with their two sleepy children in tow. "What's wrong?"

"Robert and William went into the mountains and haven't returned." Michael quickly gathered a flashlight and a thick coat. "I need to go look for them."

Emily's heart lurched. The deep woods in the dead of winter... She didn’t dare finish the thought. "Be careful," she urged.

"Mom, did Uncle Robert go hunting?" David rubbed his eyes.

"Yes, so remember this," Emily crouched to meet their gazes, her tone serious. "The mountains are dangerous. You must never go there, understand?"

Tommy tilted his head. "But Ethan goes every day."

"He only gathers firewood at the foot of the hills." Emily ruffled his hair. "Now, back to bed."

Michael called for Daniel River, and the two set off into the mountains, flashlights cutting through the snowy darkness.

"Third Brother, they’ve got no sense!" Daniel grumbled as they trudged forward. "Going into the woods at night—are they trying to get themselves killed?"

Michael’s expression darkened. "This was definitely William’s idea."

"Didn’t he learn his lesson after last time?" Daniel muttered, recalling how William had once led villagers to steal grain from the Supply & Market—only to be soundly beaten by Michael afterward.

Their flashlight beams wavered over the snow as they pressed deeper into the forest.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Stone paced restlessly at home, her gaze darting toward the door. If something happened to her husband, how would the family survive? And with all those unpaid debts...

Patricia Stone was even more frantic. After waiting in vain for her husband’s return, she finally rushed to her in-laws’ door in a panic.

"Father! Mother! Something terrible has happened!" she cried.

John Stone Sr. threw on a coat and opened the door, his breath catching at her words. "What? William went into the mountains?"

"He left this afternoon and still isn’t back..." Patricia dissolved into tears.

The elder Stone’s face twisted with anger. As William’s father, he knew exactly how little skill his second son possessed. What foolhardiness made him think he could hunt in the dead of winter?

"Quick, gather the villagers to help!" John spun back inside. "Mary, fetch my hunting rifle!"

The night was pitch-black, the wind howling like a beast. From deep within the forest, the distant cry of wolves echoed through the trees.
###Chapter 162: Search in the Deep Mountains

"Damn it!" John Stone Sr. spat angrily before rushing inside to grab a flashlight.

"What's wrong?" Mary Stone followed him anxiously.

"That idiot William went into the mountains. I need Michael's help!"

Mary gasped. "William went into the mountains? He's always been terrified of them!"

In the past, it was always Michael who secretly brought game to the main house. Back then, the family hadn't split up, and everyone could enjoy meat occasionally. Now, with separate households, they had to fend for themselves.

"Be careful," Mary said, not daring to suggest going along—she didn’t want to slow him down. Her husband was surely heading to Michael’s place to ask for help in the search.

John Sr. emerged gripping the flashlight and saw Patricia still standing frozen at the door.

"Go home. I'll get Michael to help look for him."

Patricia shrank back, unwilling to face her brother-in-law. When Michael lost his temper, it was no joke.

"Dad, please find William..."

John Sr. ignored her, slamming the door shut before hurrying toward Michael’s house with the flashlight.

Emily Johnson had just snuggled into bed when urgent shouts came from outside.

"Who is it?" she grumbled, forcing herself up. The winter night was bitterly cold, and the warmth of the blankets was hard to leave.

"Dad, Robert might have gone into the mountains. He hasn’t come back yet. Michael already went to look for him."

"Robert went into the mountains?" John Sr.'s brow furrowed. Since when would Robert willingly enter the wilderness? William must have talked him into it!

"I understand."

Not daring to venture into the mountains alone, John Sr. went to find his nephew. But when he reached his elder brother’s house, he learned Daniel had already been called away by Michael. Left with no choice, he found another nephew to accompany him.

Deep in the forest...

"Big brother..." William Stone’s voice trembled. The terrifying events of the day had shaken him to the core. Now he huddled close to Robert, too scared to move.

Night had fallen completely, leaving them stranded in the wilderness with no choice but to wait for rescue.

Michael followed the scent of blood and finally found them in a secluded hollow.

"Michael!" Robert called weakly.

William kept his head down, unable to meet his younger brother’s gaze.

"Cousin, your leg needs a hospital!" Michael crouched to examine the injury, his tone sharp. "Why didn’t you come to me if you wanted to go into the mountains? What good was bringing William?"

William shrank further, silent.

"Cousin William, were you trying to get Robert killed?" Daniel couldn’t resist sneering. "Going into the mountains in winter and letting him get hurt like this!"

They had wasted so much time searching. They could have been warm and comfortable in bed by now!

"That’s not true!" William protested.

"Daniel, help me." Michael swiftly gathered vines and used branches to brace Robert’s broken leg. The rough descent required precautions.

Daniel shot William a glare but stepped forward to assist without hesitation.

"Hold on, Robert." Michael hoisted his cousin onto his back. The weight of the grown man made each step heavy.

Daniel led the way with the flashlight while William, nursing his own injuries, stumbled along at the rear.

Halfway down, they met John Sr. and Daniel’s older brother rushing toward them.

"We need to get him to town—his leg is broken!" Michael panted.
###Chapter 163 Midnight Terror

"Put-put-put—"

The sound of the tractor tore through the silent night. Michael Stone gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white. In the back, Robert Stone lay pale, his right leg twisted at an unnatural angle. Daniel River pressed hard against his cousin's wound, but blood still seeped between his fingers.

"Faster!" John Stone Sr.'s voice was hoarse, his eyes bloodshot.

At the village entrance, Elizabeth Stone paced anxiously. Little Lily rubbed her sleepy eyes, clinging to her mother's sleeve.

"Mom, when will Dad be back?"

As soon as the words left her mouth, distant shouts echoed through the darkness. Villagers came running with a stretcher. Elizabeth's legs gave way when she saw who was on it.

"Robert!"

"Don't panic, sis," Michael jumped down from the tractor. "It's his leg. We need to get him to town."

Her hands trembled as she touched her husband's face—cold to the touch. "How did this happen...?"

"It's William's fault!" John Sr. ground his teeth. "He had to drag Robert into the mountains to hunt!"

The tractor roared back to life in the darkness. William shrank into a corner, sweat still beading on his forehead. If Robert hadn't pushed him out of the way, he'd be the one lying there now.

The clinic's light glared harshly in the dark. The on-duty doctor, startled awake by frantic knocking, opened the door bleary-eyed.

"Compound fracture. Needs immediate treatment." The doctor frowned after examining the injury. "Why did you wait so long?"

Michael swallowed hard. "The mountain roads were rough."

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled the air. Robert broke out in a cold sweat from the pain but clenched his jaw, refusing to make a sound. Elizabeth's tears fell onto his hand, burning him with guilt.

"It's... fine," he forced a weak smile. "Just needs time..."

From the corner, William finally let out a pained groan. His arm was still bleeding, but no one paid him any attention.

"Now you feel the pain?" John Sr. raised his hand to strike but stopped mid-air, exhaling heavily. "You brothers..."

Outside, the first light of dawn crept over the horizon. Michael leaned against the wall, pulling out a bloodstained cigarette pack from his pocket. Robert had given him this cigarette yesterday, saying they'd share a drink after selling their mountain goods.

The cigarette trembled between his fingers, refusing to light.
###Chapter 164: Trouble from Loose Lips

"Who knew this would happen?"

William Stone crouched in the corner, shoulders hunched, nervously twisting the hem of his shirt. The debt from building their house still hadn't been paid off, and now with Robert's injury—how much more would they have to spend?

Daniel River shot his cousin a disdainful glance and scoffed. "Only William knows exactly how Robert got hurt. Now that his leg's broken and he needs rest, who's going to fetch water and chop firewood? His wife?"

He paused deliberately, raising his voice. "If William hadn't dragged him into the mountains, would Robert—careful as he is—have gone deep into the woods?"

The implication was clear: William was to blame.

With another truck run coming up, Daniel wasn't about to let his own wife shoulder the burden. He was determined to dump all the heavy labor onto William.

"It was me... all my fault..." William stole a glance at Michael's dark expression, cold sweat trickling down his back. He knew firsthand how hard Michael's fists could hit.

John Stone Sr. tapped his pipe against the table, scanning his sons' faces. "William, you'll take care of the heavy chores at Robert's place while he recovers."

"I'll do it, I'll do all of it!" William nodded frantically.

"Uncle," Daniel cut in, "shouldn't the medical bills be split?" He shot a meaningful look at William. "Why should Michael pay for everything?"

The house debt was their problem—nothing to do with Michael. He was here to make sure his cousin didn't get cheated.

"Daniel has a point," John exhaled a cloud of smoke. "You're fathers now—act like it. Learn your lesson."

William opened his mouth but didn't dare argue. The old man's gaze was sharp as a knife, and Michael's clenched fists looked ready to tear him apart.

"Lucky this time," Daniel grinned. "Next time you wander off recklessly... might just leave your bones in the mountains."

Robert paled on the sickbed, too afraid to speak.

"Shut up!" William lunged to cover Daniel's mouth. This brat had no filter.

"Dad," Michael finally spoke, "let William stay and help. We're heading back." He couldn't even bother looking at the two fools.

It was late—his wife would be worried. Last time he came home at midnight, she hadn't slept well.

"Fine." John stood, dusting off his clothes. "Tell Robert's wife to come to town tomorrow." After all, they were separate households now—let them handle their own problems.

Michael's decisive nature clearly came from his father.

"You're leaving already?" William gaped. They were starving and exhausted...

No one answered. The tractor rumbled into the night, soon reaching the village. Before heading home, Michael made a point to wash up at the well.

As soon as he lay down, a warm figure curled into his arms.

"You're back?" His wife's sleepy voice was soft.

"Yeah." He gently patted her back. "Sleep."

Moonlight filtered through the window, casting crisscrossed shadows on the floor. Michael gazed at her peaceful face, his expression softening. The mess could wait till morning.
###Chapter 165: Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire

At the crack of dawn, Elizabeth Stone hurried toward the old house with dark circles under her eyes. She hadn’t slept a wink all night, her mind restless with worry.

"Father, how’s Robert?" she asked, standing in the courtyard, her voice trembling. "I heard he broke his leg?"

John Stone Sr. was washing his face at the well. He had returned late the previous night, his eyes still bloodshot. "It’s broken, but the clinic set it," he said, wringing out the towel. "Pack some food and take the oxcart to town to see him."

Just as Elizabeth was about to sigh in relief, her father-in-law added, "The medical bills will be split between your families. I’ll deduct it from your share at year’s end."

"What?" Elizabeth nearly jumped. "Why should we pay half?"

"If you hadn’t insisted on going into the mountains, would this have happened?" John Sr. shot her a glare. "Now go make breakfast!"

Fuming, Elizabeth stormed back home. What a mess—no gain, only trouble. The thought of losing a strong laborer for months made her sick with regret.

In the Stone family’s smaller courtyard, Emily Johnson woke up sweating.

Blinking groggily, she realized she was completely wrapped in Michael Stone’s arms. His iron-like grip held her close, his warm breath tickling the back of her neck.

Emily froze.

She tried to inch away carefully, but a husky voice murmured behind her, "Sleep a little longer."

"I—I should get up..." she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Michael nuzzled her shoulder, eyes still closed, and tightened his hold. "We were up half the night. Rest a bit more."

Emily’s face burned. Only then did she notice how closely they were pressed together—close enough to feel the rise and fall of his chest.

"You... let go first..."

Finally opening his eyes, Michael gazed at his flustered wife and couldn’t resist kissing her cheek. "I’ll make breakfast. You sleep in."

"No!" Emily scrambled up. "You were exhausted last night. You should rest."

She fumbled into her clothes, not even bothering to comb her hair before darting outside. Even after shutting the door, she could still hear his low chuckle from inside.

Standing in the courtyard, Emily pressed her hands to her flushed cheeks. A sudden realization hit her—this man had probably gotten used to holding her while he slept!

In the kitchen, she distractedly rinsed the rice. The water bubbled noisily in the pot, mirroring the chaos in her mind.


###Chapter 166: Preparations Before Departure

"Mommy..."

The morning sunlight streamed through the window as David and Tommy rubbed their eyes and crawled out of bed.

"Where's Daddy?" Tommy stood on tiptoes, peering at the bed, only to find Mommy alone.

"Daddy's still sleeping." Emily tied on her apron. "Mommy will make breakfast today."

David tilted his head, his little face full of confusion. Usually, Daddy was the one who got up early to cook.

"Mommy, is Daddy sick?" David tugged at her sleeve, his voice laced with worry.

"No," Emily patted his head. "Daddy came home late last night. What would you like to eat?"

"Sweet potato cakes!" Tommy immediately raised his hand.

"Alright." Emily smiled and nodded. "David, help Mommy with the fire. Tommy, go fetch some firewood."

The kitchen soon buzzed with activity. Emily deftly peeled sweet potatoes, the knife glinting silver in the morning light. Steam rose from the steamer, filling the air with the sweet aroma of flour and sugar.

"Daddy, wake up!" Tommy bounded into the bedroom.

Michael jolted awake to see his youngest son leaning over the bed.

"Mommy made something yummy!" Tommy's eyes sparkled.

"Okay." Michael ruffled his son's hair and quickly dressed.

This habit had formed after marrying Emily—washing his face, brushing his teeth, bathing frequently, and changing clothes daily. At first, it had felt tedious, but now it was second nature.

At the breakfast table, Michael brought up yesterday's events. "Robert and William ran into a wild boar pack in the mountains. Robert broke his leg."

"Wild boars?" Emily paused mid-motion.

"Food is scarce in winter, so they travel in groups." Michael spoke calmly, as if discussing someone else's misfortune. "They ran fast, or they wouldn't have made it."

The boys' eyes widened, their sweet potato cakes forgotten in their mouths.

"Clean your room after breakfast," Michael told the children. "Daddy needs to wash the sheets."

"But we just washed them last week," David said, puzzled.

"It's time to change them." Michael didn't elaborate.

Emily understood—he was preparing for tomorrow's departure. She watched as he busied himself—tidying the house, chopping firewood, gathering kindling, even scrubbing the children's socks and shoes spotless.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth hurried to the town clinic with food supplies, driving the oxcart. Pushing open the hospital door, she found two grown men nearly faint with hunger.

"What took you so long!" William snatched the food container and wolfed it down.

Elizabeth sighed in relief at the sight of her husband's leg in a cast.

"Where's my wife?" William mumbled through a mouthful of food.

"Haven't seen her." Elizabeth rolled her eyes.
###Chapter 167: Ethan's Exchange

William Stone lay on the clinic bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. His wife hadn’t even come to see him? His eldest cousin had clearly delivered the message last night.

"Sister-in-law, I’ll head back first. I’ll bring the ox cart tomorrow to pick up my brother," William said, rubbing his sore back. Sleeping on the hard wooden bed had left his whole body aching.

"Alright."

On the ox cart back to the village, several women eyed him curiously.

"William, what happened to you?"
"Did you fall?"

William tugged at his tattered cotton coat. "It’s nothing."

The women exchanged glances. He clearly wasn’t fine, but seeing his dark expression, they didn’t press further.

"Wife! Wife!"
The moment he stepped into the house, William bellowed.

"Dad!" Little George ran in from outside, his cheeks red from the cold.

"Where’s your mother?"

"She went to the private plot."

William’s heart sank. She hadn’t visited him last night, and now she wasn’t even home waiting for him. He trudged inside, stripped off his coat, and collapsed onto the heated bed.

"Dad, where’s the meat?" Little George asked eagerly.

"None," William replied without turning around.

The boy stood there, disappointed. David and Tommy’s family had meat every day—how could his father return empty-handed from the mountains?

Meanwhile, Michael Stone was chopping firewood in the yard.

"Take a break," Emily Johnson said, handing him a cup of warm water.

"I’m not tired. This is easier than fieldwork," Michael replied, taking the cup. His fingers brushed against hers, and they both froze for a second.

Emily suddenly realized that after the autumn harvest, no one in the family had gone to work. If this continued, they might not have enough grain by year-end.

"If thieves come, don’t hold back," Michael murmured.

"I’ll go cook," he said, turning toward the kitchen, his ears faintly red.

Emily glanced at the sun—it wasn’t even time to start dinner yet.

After lunch, Michael left the house. Since their quilts were being washed, David and Tommy had to nap in their mother’s room. But the two boys were full of energy, flipping through a picture book with her.

"Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!"

Ethan’s voice called from outside the courtyard.

"It’s Ethan!" David jumped up to open the gate.

Ethan stood at the entrance, holding a cloth bag. "Sister-in-law, the kudzu starch..."

Emily took it and filled the bag with flour, then added a bundle of noodles and a packet of sugar.

"Your shoes..." She noticed his worn-out cloth shoes, his feet red from the cold.

She turned and fetched a pair of slightly used rubber boots. "Try these on."

Ethan rubbed his hands nervously. "Sister-in-law, this is too much..."

Emily shook her head with a smile. "You don’t know—the Supply & Market sells kudzu starch for eighty cents a pound. I feel like I’m taking advantage of you."

Ethan’s eyes welled up. Clutching the items, he bowed deeply, then turned and ran out of the courtyard.
###Chapter 168: Reluctant to Let Him Go

"Flour is only twenty cents per pound."

Eighty cents per pound? That's too expensive—almost as much as meat.

The day before yesterday, she'd gone hunting with Michael and they'd bagged two wild rabbits. He'd carefully salted them, planning to smoke the meat so it would keep longer. Whenever they wanted some, they could just cut off a piece and cook it.

"Sis, these rubber boots look brand new. I can't accept them."

"They're not new. I've worn them a few times, but they're too stiff and hurt my feet. David and Tommy are still too small for them, and Michael's feet are too big."

"Ethan, just take them!"

In the end, Ethan left with the basket—filled with flour, sugar, noodles, and the rubber boots.

Though they were secondhand, few children in the village owned rubber boots.

Dinner was simple.

After the boys fell asleep, Emily lit the kerosene lamp and watched Michael pack. He would leave first thing in the morning after breakfast.

"I have some spices. I'll make you some braised eggs while you finish packing."

Emily turned and headed to the kitchen. The boys were sound asleep.

She took out the spices and added a packet of braising mix to a pot of boiling water. In another pot, she boiled over twenty eggs.

Once the eggs were cooked, she cracked their shells lightly before returning them to the braising liquid. This would let the flavors seep in.

She knew all about tea eggs and braised eggs—she'd eaten plenty before.

"Sweetheart..."

Michael finished packing his clothes and came to the kitchen when she didn't return.

"All done? I'm making braised eggs for you. If they soak overnight and you reheat them tomorrow, they'll be full of flavor."

She didn’t want him to leave.

And he didn’t want to go either.

But if he didn’t earn more before the New Year, how would they afford a house in the city when she got into university next year?

He'd heard city homes were outrageously expensive—thousands for even a small one. A bigger place would cost even more.

"Let me help."

"It's already done. We should get some sleep—you have to wake up early."

Without realizing it, she'd grown used to sharing a home with him. Now that he was leaving, she felt strangely hollow.

She had to admit, though he might be gruff with others, he was always gentle and considerate with her. He took care of the laundry and cooking without complaint.

"Alright, let's sleep." Michael picked up the kerosene lamp with one hand and took hers with the other, leading her to their room.

"Sleep well, sweetheart."

As much as he hated to leave, he remembered his promise to her. He wouldn’t push her if she wasn’t ready.

Still, just holding her as they slept was happiness enough for him. If he couldn’t have the meat, he’d settle for the broth.

"Stop it."

One kiss was enough—did he have to keep going?

"Sweetheart, I’ll miss you. Will you miss me?" Michael nuzzled her cheek and whispered in her ear.

How was she supposed to answer that?

"I’ll miss you. Be careful out there—don’t let anyone trick you. Even kids and women could be trouble."

She was worried about him.

He couldn’t resist kissing her again.

Emily seriously considered kicking him off the bed.

"Don’t buy unnecessary things. Since it’s almost New Year, bring back some local specialties."

Her voice was so sweet, especially in the quiet of the night.

"Sweetheart, you have to miss me."

Emily took a deep breath. "Michael, I’ll miss you."

There. Was that enough?
###Chapter 169: Intimacy Before Departure

"You smell so good, sweetheart," Michael murmured, pulling his sleeping wife closer, breathing in the floral scent of her hair. The thought of being away for so long already made his chest ache.

Emily, who had been pretending to sleep, felt her eyelashes flutter. Is he ever going to sleep? It was the middle of the night, and he was still wide awake.

When his arm tightened around her waist, she gave up resisting. There was no escaping him anyway—might as well let him be.

By morning, sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains, and the bed was empty except for her. Emily bolted upright, her hand reaching for the cold sheets beside her.

"Mommy's awake!" Tommy ran in, waving a little wooden horse. "Daddy said not to wake you."

He left? Without even saying goodbye?

A hollow feeling settled in her chest, making even the simple act of putting on her shoes feel sluggish.

"Daddy promised to buy us marbles!" David chirped, holding out a warm boiled egg. "Mommy, eat!"

The table was set with steaming porridge and golden fried eggs, their edges crisp. Emily chewed mechanically, the food tasteless in her mouth.

Meanwhile, on the oxcart heading toward town—

"Michael, that smell..." Daniel sniffed the air, his eyes darting toward Michael's bundle.

"Emily made it last night," Michael said, unable to suppress a smile. "She even added tea leaves."

"Your wife treats you so well now." Daniel remembered the Emily who used to be nothing but trouble—she was like a completely different person.

Michael protectively pulled the bundle closer. "Who else would she treat well if not me?"

The oxcart creaked along the dirt path, the four figures gradually disappearing into the morning mist. They needed to catch the earliest bus passing through town, then transfer to the train station in the city.

Emily spent the day distracted. She scattered chicken feed everywhere while feeding the hens and nearly dropped a clothes hanger into the well while hanging laundry. Only when the sun dipped below the horizon did she realize how eerily quiet the house was.

"Mommy, Uncle Robert sent sweet potatoes!" David rushed in with an oil-paper package. "I gave them brown sugar like you said."

That night, lying on the suddenly too-spacious bed, Emily tossed and turned. The boys sprawled out in deep sleep, but she stared blankly at the ceiling.

A terrifying thought struck her—she might actually have feelings for Michael.

"This can't be!" She yanked the blanket over her head. In the original story, the male lead belonged to the female lead. How could a side character like her—

No, it had to be an illusion from living together day and night. Once she left for college next year, everything would be fine. She tried to convince herself, but the ache in her chest refused to fade.

Meanwhile, on the train, Michael was just as restless. The hard seat dug into his back, but the emptiness in his arms was worse. He pulled out a still-warm spiced egg from his pocket and smiled faintly in the dark.

In the days that followed, Emily busied herself with foraging to fill the void. Wild berries from the hills, exotic fruits from the deep woods—until Mary arrived with cypress branches, snapping her out of her daze.

"Use beanstalks first, then the cypress when it's late," Mary instructed briskly, setting up the smoking rack. "Stray cats love the smell of meat—make sure the kitchen windows are shut tight."

As smoke curled through the air, Emily gazed absently at the path beyond the courtyard. Where is he now?
###Chapter 170: The Maternal Family's Scheme

"Mom, has Emily replied yet?" The eldest daughter-in-law of the Johnson family asked casually while sorting vegetables.

Mrs. Johnson paused her movements and sighed. "Not yet."

A heavy silence filled the kitchen. The eldest daughter-in-law's eyes darted around as she placed the sorted vegetables into a basin.

"Mom, the policy allowing educated youths to return to the city is becoming more lenient. Shouldn't we write to Emily again? We can't let her stay in that backwater village forever."

Mrs. Johnson wiped her hands, her gaze distant. The memory of her youngest daughter's heart-wrenching sobs when she was sent to the countryside still haunted her.

"You're right. We should find a way to bring her back," Mrs. Johnson murmured.

Seizing the opportunity, the eldest daughter-in-law leaned closer. "I heard the deputy factory director's widowed son is looking for a well-educated second wife. If Emily could—"

"But..." Mrs. Johnson hesitated.

"Mom, think about it. After all these years in the countryside, Emily must have aged terribly. Marrying into the deputy factory director's family would be a blessing for her!" The eldest daughter-in-law lowered her voice. "Besides, if this works out, it would benefit our family too, wouldn't it?"

Mrs. Johnson twisted the edge of her apron unconsciously. "I need to discuss this with your father."

"Of course," the eldest daughter-in-law agreed, though she was certain her father-in-law would consent. In this patriarchal household, daughters were never as valued as sons.

And she had given the Johnsons two healthy grandsons. Her brother-in-law's family only had one son—hardly impressive in the eyes of her in-laws.

"Mom, don't worry too much. If Emily is sensible, she should understand that sending her away back then was necessary. You and Dad have sent her money and supplies all these years. She should be grateful."

Mrs. Johnson nodded, oblivious to the scheming glint in her daughter-in-law's eyes.

Meanwhile, far away in the countryside, Emily Johnson was busy curing smoked meat. Wisps of smoke curled upward as her two children stared longingly at the meat hanging from the rafters.

"Mom, how much longer until the meat is ready?" David asked, tilting his little face upward.

Emily wiped the sweat from her brow. "We'll ask Grandma when she gets here."

She had no idea that back in the city, her maternal family was plotting her fate. A scheme that would alter her life was quietly unfolding.
###Chapter 171: Stubborn Father and Daughter

"What's gotten into that girl Emily now?" Mr. Johnson slammed his teacup onto the table, spilling a few drops.

Mrs. Johnson looked up from her ledger, giving him a pointed glance. "She takes after you, doesn't she?"

As the factory's seasoned accountant, Mrs. Johnson saw right through the family dynamics. Her daughter-in-law's schemes were as clear as day to her.

"She still hasn't forgiven you for sending her to the countryside," Mrs. Johnson sighed, her abacus clicking sharply. "Why must you keep provoking her?"

Mr. Johnson huffed, pacing the room with his hands behind his back. "If she's so stubborn, she shouldn't come back!"

His words were firm, but Mrs. Johnson noticed the slight twitch at the corner of his eye.

"Six years, and not a single proper letter," Mr. Johnson suddenly stopped, his voice lowering. "Just a few scribbled lines..."

Mrs. Johnson set down her pen, rubbing her temples. "How can she return when her own father won't relent? You know how headstrong she is."

Outside, the setting sun stretched their shadows long across the floor.

"What if she really marries someone out there in the countryside?" Mrs. Johnson's eyes welled up. "You'll regret it when it's too late!"

Mr. Johnson spun around, lips parting, but no words came out.

Meanwhile, in the Bright family's courtyard...

"Sister-in-law!" Amy Bright peeked through the doorway. "Are you going to town tomorrow?"

Emily Johnson wiped her hands as she checked the curing meat. "Come in and sit. I can't leave right now."

The smoky aroma from the kitchen made Amy swallow hard. The last time her family had meat, they'd cooked it secretly in the middle of the night, afraid the smell would draw gossip.

"I need to buy medicine for Grandma," Amy twisted the hem of her shirt. "Her legs hurt terribly."

Emily paused. "Rheumatism?"

"What's rheumatism?" The girl looked bewildered.

"It's..." Emily hesitated. How could she explain modern medical terms in this era?

She turned toward the house. "Wait here. Let me see if I have any ointment that might help."

Amy stood frozen. Since when did Third Brother's family keep medicine on hand? That was more thoughtful than anything her own brother had done.

In the kitchen, the meat sizzled over the fire. Beyond the courtyard walls, someone's radio played the warbling tunes of traditional opera. Memories from two different lifetimes tangled in Emily's mind, leaving her momentarily dazed.

Which one was real?
###Chapter 172: Michael's Business Acumen

Emily Johnson paused thoughtfully before explaining, "Rheumatism pain is worst in winter—it feels like icy wind seeping into your bones. Warmth is the only relief."

"My grandma suffers the same way!" The girl's eyes reddened. "She stays up all night in pain. With my brother away, I wanted to buy her medicine in town."

Chronic rheumatism wasn't easily cured.

"I have some medicated plasters that can ease the pain." Emily turned toward the house. "Wait here."

She quickly retrieved Yunnan Plaster from her system, removing the packaging to reveal the medicinal patch.

"Sorry for the wait." Emily returned with the plasters. "Soak her feet in warm water before bed, then apply a hot towel to the painful area. Heat the skin before applying the plaster—dry it thoroughly, or it won't stick properly..."

As she spoke, she demonstrated how to peel off the backing.

"Emily, how much do these cost?" Amy Bright inhaled the strong herbal scent, certain they must be expensive.

"Nothing. They've been sitting too long—their potency is half gone anyway." Emily waved her off. "Hurry and take them to your grandmother."

Amy thought of her grandmother's pained groans. Now that their family's situation had improved, her brother even sent food from the city.

"Thank you!" Clutching the plasters, she sprinted home.

She immediately boiled water, washing and warming her grandmother's feet. Before Grandma Bright could react, the plaster was already on her knee.

"Amy, what's this?"

Amy repeated Emily's instructions verbatim.

"A plaster?" Grandma Bright touched her knee. "It stings a little... but there's warmth, like something seeping into the bone..."

It was working!

Ten plasters would last five applications. Amy carefully wrapped the extras in newspaper, afraid the medicine would lose its potency.

......

"Michael, the goods are all here!" Daniel River's eyes gleamed with excitement. "We'll make a huge profit flipping these!"

This time, Michael must have emptied his savings—with more capital, they secured better wholesale prices.

"We'll sell elsewhere," Michael Stone calculated. "The price gap will be wider."

Charles Clark grunted, "I'll follow your lead."

"Stay sharp." Michael scanned the three of them. "After New Year's, I'll have to leave once my wife starts university."

"I'm coming with you!" Daniel declared instantly. As a bachelor, he'd follow Michael anywhere.

Samuel Bright hesitated. He still had his grandmother and sister to care for.

Charles scratched his head. "I'm sticking with Michael too." Farming couldn't compare to the quick money of business.

"It's still early." Michael cut them off. "Let's focus on selling this batch first."

With policies loosening, they no longer had to hide from inspectors. The four crouched in the warehouse, eyeing their stacked merchandise with eager anticipation.
###Chapter 173: The Cured Meat Incident

"Mom, try this spiced pork." Emily Johnson picked up a glistening slice and placed it in Mary Stone's bowl.

Mary took a bite, her eyes lighting up instantly. "This flavor is even better than Old Zhang's recipe!"

The rich aroma of meat filled the yard. Emily and Michael Stone were busy curing the meat over the fire, beads of sweat forming on their brows from the heat and smoke.

"Emily, if you smoke it any longer, it'll get too dry," Mary advised, circling the smoking rack. "The spiced pork needs another two days to air-dry."

Emily wiped her hands. "You're right. Michael, turn the fire down a little."

"Got it!" Michael quickly adjusted the flames.

At dinner, John Stone Sr. was invited to taste the results. The table was laden with stir-fried cured meat and dried vegetables, a platter of spiced pork, and homemade sausages—all fragrant and tempting.

"Dad, try this." Emily served her father-in-law a piece of spiced pork.

John chewed thoughtfully before nodding in approval. "Excellent! Even better than what they sell at the Supply & Market!"

"Of course. Would my wife's cooking ever disappoint?" Michael grinned, stuffing another slice of cured meat into his mouth.

Mary watched the young couple with a pleased smile. "Emily, where did you learn to cook like this?"

"From a book," Emily replied modestly. "I was afraid I'd ruin good meat on my first try."

"Nonsense!" Mary clapped her knee. "This is good enough for a holiday feast!"

After dinner, Emily offered to send some meat home with her in-laws, but Mary waved her off.

"No need. Michael brought us some just the other day—we still have plenty left." She turned to leave.

"Mom, have you finished that jar of malt extract?" Emily asked.

Mary paused, her expression complicated. "There's still some left... but your eldest brother's family..." She sighed and didn't finish.

Emily understood. Since the family split, Elizabeth Stone had grown increasingly distant from her in-laws.

After seeing them off, Tommy suddenly tugged at Emily's sleeve. "Mom, can we give some meat to Charlie's family?"

Emily knelt to meet his gaze. "Tommy, how about I tell you a story first?"

Both boys gathered around eagerly.

"Once, there was a kind farmer who saved a frozen snake in the snow..."

As night deepened, the glow from the hearth flickered across their faces. Emily spoke softly, and the children's expressions shifted from innocence to solemn understanding.

"So, helping others is good, but you must also learn to protect yourselves," Emily said, ruffling their hair. "Just like our cured meat—if the wrong people knew about it..."

"They'd steal it!" David gasped, clutching her arm.

Tommy nodded vigorously. "Then we won't tell anyone!"

Emily smiled in relief. She didn’t want her children growing up naive enough to be taken advantage of.
###Chapter 174: Raising Little Schemers

"Mom, are there really such bad people in the world?" David tilted his little head, his bright eyes filled with confusion.

Emily Johnson looked at her two sons' eager expressions and nodded gently. "There are many people like that. That's why we need to learn to protect ourselves."

Tommy sucked on his finger and asked in his tiny voice, "Does that mean we can't share candy with others anymore?"

"Of course you can," Emily ruffled their hair. "But be careful who you share with. I trust you both to tell good people from bad ones."

She almost mentioned "fair-weather friends," but worried the concept might be too complex for them. Little did she know, her two boys were already well on their way to becoming master schemers.

"You haven't played outside in days, have you?" Emily pulled out a few breadsticks from the cupboard. "Go have some fun, but be back before dark."

The boys cheered and scampered out like excited rabbits. Guarding that pot of meat had left them restless for too long.

Once they were gone, Emily immediately retrieved an orange from her space and peeled it with relish. She hadn’t dared eat even an apple in front of Michael Stone—how she had missed this!

"Mmm... so sweet!" She closed her eyes, savoring this rare moment of solitude.

Meanwhile, David and Tommy dashed straight to Aunt Elizabeth's house.

"Grace! Jack!" The two peeked through the gate.

Grace, playing in the yard, looked up and beamed. "David! Tommy!"

"Here!" David pulled breadsticks from his pocket like a magician and carefully broke them in half.

Aunt Elizabeth stepped out from the kitchen, her heart aching at the sight of her nephews in their brand-new coats. Why was the gap between the Stone children so wide?

"Hello, Auntie!" The boys chirped before grabbing Grace and Jack and running off.

Inside, Uncle Robert sighed heavily at the sound of children's laughter. His injuries left him restless and irritable.

After playing, the boys returned home to find Emily packing for tomorrow's trip to town.

"David, go ask Sister Amy if she wants to come with us tomorrow."

"Okay!" Without hesitation, David sprinted toward the Brights' house.

The distance wasn’t short, and the little boy arrived flushed and panting.

"Sister Amy!" he called from the gate.

Amy Bright, hanging laundry, turned at the sound. "David? Come in!"

"Mom wants to know if you're going to town tomorrow."

Amy's eyes lit up. She had been worrying about Grandma's medicated plasters running out but didn’t want to ask for more.

"Yes! I’ll meet your mom tomorrow." She crouched down to pinch David’s cheek. "Wait here—I’ll get you some sweet potato chips."

Grandma Bright wobbled over and stuffed a generous handful into David’s hands. "Good boy, take these."

"Thank you, Grandma!" David beamed, already plotting how to brag about his success to his mother.
###Chapter 175: No More Sweets for Kids

Grandma Bright squinted at the twins before her. During the last harvest, they had been two skinny, sunburnt little sprouts. Now, they were plump and rosy-cheeked, dressed in brand-new cotton shoes and thick padded jackets—they could pass for children of city officials.

"Thank you, Grandma!" Tommy chirped, clutching the dried sweet potato strips tightly in his small hand.

The boys didn’t linger. Tucking away their treats, they dashed home in a flash.

"Mom! Grandma Bright gave us sweet potato strips!"

Emily Johnson was busy by the stove. She arched an eyebrow. "Grandma Bright? You should call her Granny Bright." There was a generational difference, after all.

Tommy stretched on his tiptoes to stuff a strip into his mother’s mouth. "Try it, Mom! It’s so sweet!"

It was indeed sweet. As Emily chewed the handmade snack, a thought struck her. "Tomorrow, I’m going to town with Amy. Do you want to stay at Grandma Stone’s or—"

"We’ll guard the house!" David blurted out. The cured meat still hung from the kitchen beam—his father had brought it back from the mountains. No way would he let anyone steal it.

The next morning, Emily assigned the boys their homework and checked the doors and windows.

"What do you want me to bring back?"

David shook his head, but Tommy’s eyes lit up. "Mom, can we have soda? The kind Dad bought last time—" His voice trailed off, bracing for rejection.

"One bottle only." Emily pinched his cheek. "Too much isn’t good for your teeth."

Tommy threw his arms around her with a cheer. "We’ll finish our homework, promise!"

Under the old locust tree at the village entrance, Amy Bright arrived breathless. "Sorry to keep you waiting, sis!"

"Perfect timing." Emily handed over the fare for the oxcart. "Clinic first?"

The women on the cart eyed the pair curiously. One in a blue cotton jacket piped up, "Stocking up for the New Year, Emily?"

"Just getting some fabric for the boys’ new clothes." Emily deftly shifted the topic. "Heard your daughter’s getting married soon?"

The clinic reeked of antiseptic. To Emily’s surprise, the old doctor prescribed medicine without even asking questions.

"Why the daze, sis?" Amy tugged her sleeve. "We’ll miss the queue at the Supply & Market."

Seeing the snaking line ahead, Emily suddenly gripped Amy’s wrist. "Remember—wait for me right here." Her tone was so grave it froze the girl in place.

(Cliffhanger: Why is Emily so tense? What—or who—is she guarding against?)
###Chapter 176: Trust No One

"Amy, I'm not a child who'll get lost," pouted Amy Bright, thinking her sister-in-law was being overly cautious.

Emily Johnson grasped her hand firmly, her tone serious. "The town isn't safe lately. Listen to me."

Amy was startled by Emily's expression and quickly nodded. "I promise I won't wander off. I'll wait for you at the Supply & Market."

Emily sighed inwardly. In her past life, she had seen too many cases of abduction—she couldn’t afford to be careless.

"I still need to come back for more shopping later. Can you hold my place in line?" Emily came up with the idea on the spot. This way, Amy wouldn’t stray.

"Don’t worry, I’ll keep your spot!" Though puzzled, Amy agreed obediently.

Emily turned away, mentally listing the items she needed. Some things couldn’t just appear from her space—she had to find a plausible explanation.

The Supply & Market was bustling. Emily bought ten pairs of nylon socks, two pairs of cashmere socks, and some seasonal fruits and ribs. Her woven basket gradually filled before she headed back.

"Emily! Over here!" Amy waved from a distance.

"Why is she cutting in line?" someone grumbled behind her.

Amy quickly explained, "She’s not! I was saving her spot!"

Emily hurried over, offering an apologetic smile. The line wasn’t long—she had only done this to ensure Amy’s safety.

"Amy, wait for me just a little longer."

"Of course we’re going back together," Amy said, noticing Emily’s unusual vigilance today.

After purchasing the last few necessities, Emily finally relaxed. "Let’s go catch the ox-cart."

On the way, she lowered her voice. "When we get to the village, come home with me first. I bought a few things—see if there’s anything you need."

Amy’s heart warmed. Emily was always so thoughtful.

"Emily, what treasures did you buy?" An older woman suddenly reached to lift the cloth covering the basket.

Emily swiftly blocked her. "Auntie, don’t touch other people’s belongings."

The woman withdrew her hand sheepishly, but her eyes darted greedily, as if trying to see through the basket.

The ox-cart rocked along the country path. The woman kept sneaking glances at Emily’s basket, whispering to others.

Emily pretended not to notice but remained alert. In these times, it paid to trust no one.

Finally at the village entrance, Emily tugged Amy along as they quickened their pace home.

"David! Tommy! Mommy’s back!"

The sound of small feet pattering echoed from inside as two little figures came rushing out.
###Chapter 177: Sharing the Bounty

"Mommy, Mommy..." The two little boys came bounding over, their bright eyes fixed on the basket in Emily's hands.

Amy Bright stood nearby, wringing her hands nervously. "Sis, you wanted to see me?"

"Come inside first." Emily beckoned, shutting the courtyard gate firmly behind them.

In the main room, Emily opened the basket with a conspiratorial air. "Amy, I met a peddler in town and bought some rare goods. See if there's anything you need?"

"A peddler?" Amy's eyes widened. Private sellers were unheard of these days.

"Look, nylon socks—I bought ten pairs." Emily shook out a pair, the fine material gleaming in the sunlight.

Amy couldn't resist touching them. The smooth texture was far superior to the coarse cloth socks she'd sewn herself.

"And these." Emily pulled out several bright red apples. "They're called Fuji apples—crisp and sweet."

"How... how much do they cost?" Amy swallowed hard.

"Towel for one dollar, socks for fifty cents, fruit for fifty cents—three dollars total."

Three dollars! Amy scrambled for her money, afraid Emily might change her mind. At the Supply & Market, you couldn't even get these with ration tickets!

"Thank you, Sis!" She carefully packed her treasures into her vegetable basket, then whispered, "Will that peddler... come back?"

Emily winked. "He said he'd return before New Year's. Want to go together then?"

"Count me in!" Amy left, overjoyed.

As soon as the gate closed, the boys rushed to the table.

"Mommy, where's the soda?" Tommy asked eagerly.

"Little glutton." Emily tapped his nose. "First, we're taking some things to Grandma's. You can have some when we get back."

She quickly packed bananas, apples, and two pairs of socks. Just as she was about to leave, David tugged her sleeve. "Mommy, don't tell them we have treats."

Emily's heart warmed. She knelt and kissed her son. "Right. This is our secret."

On the way, they passed a few sharp-nosed aunties.

"Emily, what's in that basket? Smells wonderful!"

"Just some sewing supplies for Mother Stone," Emily replied smoothly.

The boys pressed their lips shut like two tight-lipped little quails.

At the Stone family home, Mary's voice boomed before they even entered. "Those two rascals here again?"

"Grandma!" The boys barreled inside. "Mommy brought yummy food!"

John Sr. emerged from the inner room, eyeing the basket. "Wasting money again?"

"Dad, it was a bargain in town." Emily lifted the cloth cover, releasing a wave of sweet fragrance.

Mary's eyes nearly popped. "Is that...?"

"Bananas and apples." Emily smiled. "And two pairs of socks for you and Dad to try."

John Sr. picked up an apple, wiped it on his sleeve, and took a loud bite.

"Sweet!" His eyes lit up. "Better than the Supply & Market's!"

Mary had already peeled a banana. One bite, and she froze. "This taste..."

The boys clung to her knees, watching with hopeful eyes.

"Here, Grandma will share." Mary broke the banana in half, her heart melting.

Emily watched the tender scene, her lips curving. These ordinary modern fruits had become precious bonds of family here.

Then she remembered the hidden surprise still in her basket—something special just for the children.
###Chapter 178: Scaring the Little Gluttons

"Going around the streets?"

Captain John Stone narrowed his eyes, his face full of disbelief. He had already sensed something unusual in the air.

"For David and Tommy."

"We still have some at home."

Emily Johnson quickly walked into the main room and began pulling items from her basket.

"Nylon socks—they'll keep you warm in winter."

Mary Stone's eyes lit up. Her daughter, who had married into town, had once flaunted a pair of nylon socks for nearly half a year. Now, her daughter-in-law had brought two pairs at once.

"Is this... a banana?"

Captain John looked up, staring at the golden fruit on the table.

"Looks like plantains."

"They need a few days to ripen—wait until the skin turns yellow before eating them. The apples are said to be from the northeast." Emily picked up a bright red apple, its sweet fragrance filling the air.

"Dad, Mom, we'll head back now."

Mary nodded eagerly, and as soon as Emily left, she hurriedly carried the items inside. Running her fingers over the thick nylon socks, warmth spread from her fingertips.

"Old man, who are you scowling at? Even though our third daughter-in-law doesn’t work in the fields, her family sends money and coupons every month. Michael doesn’t complain, so why should you, as her father-in-law—"

"Since when have I been scowling?" Captain John touched his face indignantly. This was just how he looked!

Meanwhile, Amy Bright skipped into the yard.

"Grandma, I'm back!" The little girl beamed with joy.

Grandma Bright set aside her needlework. "What did you buy in town with Emily?"

Amy pulled her grandmother inside mysteriously, lifting a patched cloth to reveal her treasures.

"Emily was lucky—she got these from somewhere else. A towel for a dollar without coupons, socks for fifty cents a pair, and two apples plus four bananas for just a dollar."

"That cheap?" Grandma Bright's eyes widened. Bananas were a rare treat in their area.

"Emily said the bananas need to soften before eating."

Remembering the envious looks from the women on the road, Amy pouted. "Those aunties were practically burning holes in Emily’s basket with their stares."

"Didn’t Peter Wilson teach them a lesson?"

"With Michael away, Emily’s alone with the kids..." Amy frowned with worry.

"Don’t mind those gossips. Come on, let’s make dinner."

Back home, Emily took out a bottle of soda from the cupboard.

"Share this between the two of you. Kids shouldn’t drink too much, or else..." She lowered her voice. "Your tongues will turn the color of soda."

David and Tommy shuddered. They’d had soda before—their tongues never changed color!

"Don’t believe me? I’ll get a mirror."

This was Emily’s foolproof trick for dealing with little gluttons. They needed to learn not to overindulge in drinks.

"Brother, let me take a sip first to test it." Tommy lifted the enamel mug, took a small sip, then stuck out his tongue and mumbled, "D-Did it change color?"
###Chapter 179: The Secret on Their Tongues

"Brother, look!" David suddenly widened his eyes and pointed at Tommy's mouth. "It really turned yellow!"

Tommy's face instantly fell. He stuck out his tongue, examining it in the reflection of the enamel mug, and his eyes immediately welled up with tears.

When Emily Johnson walked into the living room with a mirror, she found Tommy trembling like a startled rabbit, tears brimming in his eyes, while David stared solemnly at the enamel mug as if studying a groundbreaking discovery.

"Mommy, my tongue... changed color..." Tommy's voice quivered.

Emily nearly laughed out loud. These two silly boys had managed to scare themselves just by drinking soda. If they had gone to kindergarten, they'd know this was completely normal.

"Still want more?" she teased.

Tommy bit his lip in hesitation. The sweet taste was irresistible, but he was afraid his tongue would stay yellow forever. "I want to... but..."

"We can't waste it," Emily coaxed. "You two were the ones who asked for it."

The brothers exchanged glances, then reluctantly took turns sipping the soda as if it were medicine, until the bottle was empty.

"Here, look in the mirror," Emily said, handing it to them.

"Brother, your tongue is so yellow!"
"Yours too!"

Suppressing a laugh at their distressed expressions, Emily slipped into the kitchen. She'd make their favorite shrimp ball soup today, with seaweed and scallions—guaranteed to make them forget all about their tongues.

"Dinner's ready! Stop staring at the mirror!" she called out as she carried the steaming bowls into the room. The boys were still examining their tongues.

"Mommy, will it stay like this forever?" Tommy asked anxiously.

"Just two days."

Two days?! David and Tommy exchanged horrified looks. That meant they couldn't go out to play for two whole days—what if the other kids saw them?

"Eat first," Emily interrupted their wild imaginations.

"Mommy, sweet potato balls!" Tommy's eyes lit up.

Emily guiltily averted her gaze. These silly boys still thought they were eating sweet potato balls.

"How many pages did you write today?" she quickly changed the subject.

"Three for me, one for Tommy," David reported dutifully.

"I'll check them later. If they're good, there's a reward. If not..." She deliberately trailed off.

"We wrote very carefully!" they chorused.

Tommy popped a ball into his mouth and closed his eyes in bliss. "Mommy's sweet potato balls are the best!"

Emily couldn't hold back her amusement. "Want them every day?"

"I don't mind," David declared first. After experiencing hunger, he cherished every bite of food.

Seeing his brother's enthusiasm, Tommy quickly nodded. "Me too!"

Emily's heart melted at their innocent faces. These two little fools couldn't even tell shrimp from sweet potato—she'd have to teach them to read properly someday.
###Chapter 180: The Turmoil in Margaret Lee's Family

After dinner, David and Tommy quickly cleared the dishes. Emily Johnson emerged from the house with a mysterious air, holding several items: a yellowed dictionary, a brand-new pencil sharpener, a few sharpened pencils, and a colorful Rubik's Cube.

"Come see what I've prepared for you," Emily said with a smile, beckoning them over.

"The dictionary was salvaged from the recycling station—you can't buy this at the Supply & Market. The other things were either bought there or from a traveling peddler."

Tommy curiously picked up the Rubik's Cube. "Mom, what's this?"

"It's called a Rubik's Cube," Emily replied, taking it and giving it a quick twist. "See? You can turn it like this. The goal is to scramble it and then solve it so that each side has the same color."

She then expertly demonstrated how to sharpen a pencil, wood shavings falling away to reveal a fine point.

"Mom, these must have cost a lot, right?" David asked worriedly. With their father away, where had she gotten the money?

"Not much," Emily reassured him, ruffling his hair. "Starting today, I want you both to practice your handwriting. When school starts next year, I’ll send you both to class."

The two boys, too embarrassed by their yellowed tongues to go outside, busied themselves—one diligently practicing writing, the other engrossed in the Rubik's Cube, occasionally swapping tasks. The puzzle toy had completely captured their attention.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted next door at George Lee's house.

The widow's in-laws stormed in, demanding repayment of a debt, showing no regard for the fact that the Lee family had just lost their daughter.

"Three hundred dollars! Not a penny less!" the widow's mother-in-law bellowed, hands on her hips.

George Lee puffed on his pipe, unfazed. "Go ahead, make a scene! Your daughter-in-law committed adultery. If this goes to the commune, both she and my son will end up in jail!"

He exhaled a smoke ring. "I’ve looked into it—if someone in the family serves time, their descendants won’t be allowed to attend school!"

His words doused the in-laws' fury like cold water. In the end, with the mediation of the brigade leader, the Lee family settled the matter by paying a hundred dollars.

Not long after, the ex-wife's family of Jack Lee also came to cause trouble. They smashed up the Lee household in a rage but stopped short of actually sending Jack to jail.

The widow, now cast out by her in-laws, simply moved into the Lee home and began living with Jack.

"Emily! Emily!" A frantic knock came at the door.

Emily opened it to find Daisy Miller, the neighbor, her face alight with gossipy excitement.

"Come in, have a seat," Emily greeted warmly.

Daisy lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Emily, guess what? Someone spotted Margaret Lee in town!"

"What?" Emily's hand jerked, nearly knocking over the sugar jar. "But didn’t they say she drowned?"

She quickly poured Daisy a cup of sugar water, making sure it was generously sweetened.

"Oh, Emily, you’re too kind," Daisy protested, though her eyes lingered on the sweet-smelling drink, eager to share this shocking piece of news.
###Chapter 181: This Plot Is Ridiculous!

Mrs. Lee gulped down some water and leaned closer to Emily Johnson with a conspiratorial whisper. "They say Margaret Lee jumped into the river, and some passing peddler fished her out. Now the Lee family is the laughingstock of the whole village!" She lowered her voice. "That widow's in-laws got tired of waiting for the Lees to pay up, so they stormed their house demanding the money."

Emily's eyes widened. "Where would the Lees get that kind of money?"

"Exactly!" Mrs. Lee slapped her thigh. "George Lee joined the widow's in-laws in smashing up the place, shouting that they could take his life but not his money. In the end, the widow's family had to settle for a hundred bucks before kicking her out."

"And the widow now...?"

"She packed her bags and moved straight into the Lee household!" Mrs. Lee burst into laughter. "You should’ve seen it! George’s ex-daughter-in-law was even more ruthless—she went back to her parents’ house the same day and remarried!"

Emily was stunned. The drama was unfolding way too fast.

"Oh, and isn’t Margaret Lee Charles Clark’s fiancée?" Mrs. Lee suddenly recalled. "He was talking about a winter wedding!"

Emily shook her head. "I haven’t met her yet. But..." She changed the subject. "I heard the women’s committee chair is hosting a wedding soon?"

"Yes, yes!" Mrs. Lee nodded eagerly. "Her daughter’s getting married in three days. They’ll definitely invite your family." She stood up. "It’s getting late—I should head back."

Emily quickly pressed two White Rabbit candies into her hand. "For the kids."

After seeing Mrs. Lee off, Emily was still processing the absurd gossip when Mary Stone bustled in.

"Emily, your cousin’s daughter is getting married in three days. Bring the boys to the feast," Mary instructed. "Five cents as a gift will do."

"That’s it? No other gifts?" Emily hesitated.

Mary rolled her eyes. "What else would you give?" Realizing her city-bred daughter-in-law didn’t know rural customs, she added, "Just show your face and that’s enough."

No sooner had Mary left than Tommy’s wails erupted from the yard.

"Mom! George Jr. broke the Rubik’s Cube!" David fumed. "He snatched it from us, then tripped while running..."

Emily frowned at the shattered toy on the ground. That little troublemaker!
###Chapter 182: George Jr. Smashes the Rubik's Cube and Flees

David pulled a handful of broken pieces from his pocket, his small hands trembling slightly.

"Mommy..." Tommy's eyes were red, tears welling up.

Emily Johnson crouched down and carefully examined the fragments. The Rubik's Cube had shattered beyond repair, with no hope of being restored.

"George Jr. took it by force!" David clenched his fists. "He insisted on playing with it, and when we refused, he snatched it away!"

Tommy sniffled. "He... he even threw it on the ground on purpose..."

Emily picked Tommy up and gently patted his back. "Don't cry, sweetheart. Mommy will take you to see George Jr."

"But Daddy isn't home..." Tommy suddenly remembered, gripping the hem of her shirt tightly.

Emily kissed his forehead. "Mommy's here."

Meanwhile, George Jr. burst into his house, panting heavily, and slammed the door shut with a loud bang.

"What the devil?!" Patricia Stone, who was sewing shoe soles, jumped at the sudden noise. "What's gotten into you in broad daylight?"

"Mom, if anyone comes looking for me, tell them I'm not here!" George Jr.'s voice came through the crack in the door.

Patricia spat in annoyance. "Always stirring up trouble..."

Before she could finish, the courtyard gate swung open.

Emily stood at the entrance, holding her two children's hands, with a group of curious neighbor kids trailing behind her.

"Sister-in-law," Emily said coolly. "Please ask George Jr. to come out."

Patricia set down her needlework, her expression darkening. "Oh, what a rare visit. Emily, what brings you here today?"

"George Jr. stole my children's toy and deliberately broke it," Emily said, meeting her gaze squarely. "This matter needs to be addressed."

David held up the broken pieces. "Dad brought this back from the city—you can't even buy it in town!"

Patricia glanced at the fragments, her heart sinking. The toy looked expensive.

"Kids roughhousing is normal," she said with a forced laugh. "Besides, it's just a toy..."

"Five dollars," Emily stated bluntly. "Either pay up, or have George Jr. apologize in person."

"Five dollars?!" Patricia's voice shot up. "That's robbery!"

Emily smirked. "If you don't believe me, go ask at the town department store. Imported toys like this probably cost ten dollars or more."

The crowd of children outside the courtyard grew larger, and Patricia's face flushed with embarrassment.

"You little brat!" She turned and banged on George Jr.'s door. "Get out here now!"

The door didn't budge.

Emily said softly, "If you can't handle this, I'll go talk to William. And if that doesn't work, there's always the village chief."

Patricia's face turned pale, then red with anger. She kicked the door hard. "If you don't open this door right now, I'll break your legs!"

The door creaked open a sliver. George Jr. peeked out, his face ghostly white...


###Chapter 183: The Miserly Second Household

"Is this broken toy really worth that much money?" Patricia Stone's heart pounded nervously.

She clutched the hem of her dress, too afraid to agree to the compensation. That amount could buy half a pig!

"George Jr., get out here and apologize!" Patricia shouted, her voice trembling.

Apologize?

From inside the house, George Jr. curled his lip. He remembered all too clearly the last time his mother had fought with Aunt Emily.

"You little brat, come out now!" Patricia stomped her foot in frustration. She wasn’t afraid of a fight, but paying money was another matter.

In the dead of winter, with no work in the fields, where would they earn the work points?

The house remained silent—George Jr. refused to show himself.

Patricia kicked the door open, grabbed her son by the ear, and dragged him outside, landing a few sharp smacks on his backside. "If you don’t apologize, I’ll break your legs!"

George Jr.'s eyes widened in disbelief. Was this really his mother talking?

Just yesterday, she had called David and Tommy "useless burdens." The day before, she’d cursed Uncle Michael and Aunt Emily to an early grave.

Why was she cowering now that Aunt Emily was here?

Children’s thoughts were brutally honest.

Emily Johnson watched coldly as Patricia dragged her son forward, her frown deepening.

Is this how you raise a child?

"George Jr.," she said, her voice icy. "Why did you break your cousins’ toys? You’re family—you should be looking out for each other."

George Jr. jutted out his chin. "They wouldn’t let me play with it! If they hadn’t chased me, it wouldn’t have broken!"

Blaming the victims?

Emily’s gaze turned even colder. "Taking without asking is stealing. Breaking something and running away is cowardice. Refusing to admit fault now is arrogance."

The barrage of words left the boy stunned.

"When you do something wrong, shouldn’t you apologize?"

The child stammered, his eyes darting around. Patricia wrung her hands, nearly blurting out, "We’ll pay for it!"

"What’s all this commotion?"

William Stone walked in, carrying a shovel, and froze at the scene in the yard. His sister-in-law Emily was here?

Since the new house was built, this was her first visit.

"William," Emily said calmly. "I just came to talk to George Jr. about a small matter."

William’s heart skipped a beat. His eyes landed on Tommy’s red-rimmed eyes, and a cold sweat broke out on his back.

Emily had knocked out Peter Wilson in one punch. Was she about to...?
###Chapter 184: This Toy Looks Expensive

William Stone's heart skipped a beat.

"George Jr., did you pick on Tommy again?" His tone was sharp, fearing trouble.

Ever since Michael had helped build their new house, William had been on guard. His younger brother pretended to assist but secretly caused problems—like making William carry the heavier load, nearly tripping him. The worst was when he'd inexplicably tumbled into a sandpile.

Every time Michael came around, William was on edge.

Now that Michael was away, if he returned to hear the kids had caused trouble again, how would they get through the holidays?

"I didn't!" George Jr. lifted his chin stubbornly, tears welling in his eyes. His mother had dragged him here to apologize, and now his father immediately assumed he was the troublemaker.

"Uncle William, George Jr. broke our toy." Tommy held up the shattered Rubik's Cube.

A toy? Who in the village could afford toys? Most kids were happy just playing with marbles.

"Emily, kids don’t always know better..." William forced a smile, hoping she wouldn’t make a fuss.

"You're educated, William. You should know that mistakes require apologies." Emily's words left him speechless.

"Apologize now!" William barked, raising a hand as if to strike.

Patricia wanted to intervene but remembered the five dollars and stayed silent.

"I'm sorry..." George Jr. sobbed before running back to his room, his cries muffled through the door.

Emily watched the couple coldly. "Out of respect for your brother, I won’t ask for compensation this time. But if it happens again, you’ll pay for every penny. Teach your child not to snatch things."

Their faces turned ashen.

"It's getting late. Let’s go." Emily led the children away.

The moment they left, William’s expression darkened. "That Emily has picked up Michael’s bad habits—she doesn’t respect us at all!"

"And George Jr.! If he can’t play nice, he breaks things. Everything in Michael’s house is treated like gold!"

On the way home, the children chattered. "Aunt Emily, aren’t they paying for it?"

"Let me see if I can fix it." Emily took the broken pieces. "Go finish your homework. If I repair it, David will bring it to you later."

Back home, she sent the kids to study while carefully reassembling the Rubik's Cube. To her surprise, the material was durable, and she managed to restore it.

"It’s fixed, but next time it might not be salvageable." She handed the intact toy to the children.

"Mom, you’re amazing!" The two cheered.

Night fell, and thick snowflakes drifted down. By morning, the world outside was blanketed in white.
###Chapter 185: A Storm in the Snow

"Mom, it's snowing!" David pressed his face against the windowsill, his voice brimming with excitement.

Emily Johnson looked up and saw the swirling snowflakes outside. Just yesterday, the sky had been clear, but the weather had turned overnight.

"Want some grilled meat?" she asked casually.

"Yes!" both children answered in unison.

Emily shook her head with a smile. "No, you're too young for that. How about... stewed cured ribs instead?"

"Yay!" Tommy cheered, bouncing on his toes.

A sudden chill ran through Emily, and she shivered. Ever since Michael Stone had been away, she had become extra careful about keeping warm. Today, she wore her thickest thermal undershirt and a hand-sewn cotton coat.

"Mom..." David tugged at her sleeve.

"It's too cold to play outside," Emily said, kneeling to tighten the scarves around their necks. "If your boots get wet, you won’t have another pair to change into."

Meanwhile, chaos erupted at William Stone’s house.

"Mom! George Jr. is burning up!" Richard’s panicked voice came from the bedroom.

Patricia Stone rushed in and paled the moment she touched her youngest son’s forehead. "William! Come quick!"

William hurried over, and his expression darkened as he felt the fever. "We need to take him to the village doctor!"

But when they arrived, a long line had already formed. The sudden snowfall the night before had left many villagers sick.

"It’s all Emily’s fault!" Patricia hissed through gritted teeth. "George Jr. was never sick before she scared him—"

William said nothing, but his eyes held the same resentment.

Elsewhere, Mary Stone braved the snow to visit Emily and the children. She pushed open the door to find Emily teaching the boys their letters.

"Mom, what brings you here?" Emily stood quickly.

"I heard many in the village have caught colds." Mary studied her grandsons. "Glad you’re all well."

"Stay for lunch. I’m making stewed pork trotters and ribs."

"I’ll help." Mary headed straight for the kitchen.

The snow fell intermittently for days. Emily bought a free-range chicken to make soup, hoping to strengthen the boys’ health.

During this time, Ethan Miller also fell ill but refused to spend money on medicine. When Emily found out, she sent David over with fever reducers.

George Jr. took the longest to recover, and even afterward, he remained listless.

Then one day, Daisy Miller rushed in, breathless. "Emily, something terrible has happened!"

"What is it?" Emily blinked in confusion.

"Margaret Lee isn’t dead!" Daisy whispered urgently. "Someone saw her in town, dressed like a newlywed. They say she remarried!"

Emily’s eyes widened in shock. The incident of Margaret’s supposed drowning had been left unresolved, and now there was a new twist.

"She really remarried?"

"Absolutely!" Daisy said mysteriously. "Her family will raise hell when they find out."

As if on cue, George Lee and his wife were already on their way to town.

"Old man, do you really think we’ll find Daisy?" Margaret Lee fretted.

"We’d better!" George snarled. "If that bastard didn’t pay the bride price, I’ll break her legs myself!"

Amid the swirling snow, a new storm was brewing.
###Chapter 186: The Sister-in-law's Scheme

"Mother, why hasn't Emily written back yet?" The sister-in-law wrung her hands anxiously, her nerves frayed as the year-end approached.

Mrs. Johnson sighed. "We've sent two letters already..."

"Could something have happened?" The sister-in-law's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Perhaps you should visit her in person? You could bring her home for the holidays."

Her mind raced with plans: if Emily returned, she could be married off to the deputy factory director's crippled son. Then her own husband's promotion to department head would be guaranteed.

"You're right." Mrs. Johnson clapped her hands decisively. "I'll request leave at once."

A smug smile curled the sister-in-law's lips.

Meanwhile, Emily was tucking Ethan into bed. "This old quilt will have to do for now." She turned to the two younger boys, replacing their blankets with new ones.

"Emily!" The neighbor, Daisy Miller, burst in breathlessly. "Are you going to town? The Supply & Market just got a shipment of flawed fabric!"

"I'll go! I need soy sauce anyway." Emily quickly packed her basket, her thoughts drifting to the post office. That last letter pressuring her to return to the city—there might be more to it.

She remembered the original story's tragic ending, where the female lead was forced into marriage by her family and met a grim fate.

"David, Tommy, Mommy's going to town. You two—"

"We'll practice our writing!" the boys chorused.

Emily smiled, ruffling their hair. "Good boys. I'll be back soon."

Daisy was already calling from the oxcart: "Hurry! We'll miss the ride!"

Emily jogged after her, soy sauce bottle in hand, but unease prickled at her. Unbeknownst to her, a storm from her family was closing in fast.
###Chapter 187: Concern for Her Safety

The sky was just beginning to lighten when Emily Johnson stepped out with her bamboo basket.

"Little sister-in-law..."

"Emily, over here!"

With the New Year approaching, the villagers were busy preparing for the festivities. Their so-called "New Year goods" were nothing more than cheap candies that didn't require ration coupons. Only the better-off families could afford to splurge on broken biscuits.

"Emily, heading to town for New Year shopping?"

Emily shook her head. "I'll buy those in a few days. We ran out of soy sauce, and I thought I'd see if there's anything good without coupons. Last time, I stumbled upon nylon socks from out of town—they were in high demand."

At her words, the eyes of the nearby aunties lit up.

"Emily, you must tell us if you find anything good again!" one auntie said eagerly, rubbing her hands. "My kids haven't had new clothes in years."

"Exactly! Fabric coupons are so hard to come by," another chimed in.

Emily smiled and nodded. "If I find anything, I'll definitely let you all know."

After getting off the oxcart, the younger sister-in-law pulled her aside and whispered, "Don't mind those old aunties—always looking to take advantage. They're nowhere to be seen when there's work to do, but they’re quick to gossip."

Emily felt a warmth in her heart. "Don’t worry, sister-in-law. I only said I’d tell them—not that I’d buy for them."

The sister-in-law finally relaxed. "Where are you headed?"

"The post office."

"I’ll go to the Supply & Market. I’ll wait for you here when I’m done."

After parting ways, Emily hurried to the post office. She hadn’t replied to the last letter—she wondered how her original family would react. But with mountains and rivers between them, surely they wouldn’t come looking for her in person?

"Is there a package for Emily Johnson?"

The postal worker looked up. "Just a letter."

Emily handed over her reference letter and took the thin envelope. Holding it, she felt an inexplicable unease.

Tucking the letter away, she made her way to the Supply & Market, where the line already stretched out the door. The sister-in-law waved at her from a corner. "Emily, over here!"

Emily squeezed through the crowd and noticed two bulging cloth bags at the sister-in-law’s feet.

"You bought so much?"

The sister-in-law lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Rumor has it there’ll be a batch of flawed fabric arriving this afternoon. I came early to secure a spot."

Just then, a commotion broke out in the store. A salesperson shouted, "New shipment of brown sugar—no coupons needed!"

The crowd surged forward like a boiling pot. Emily stumbled, and the letter slipped from her hand, landing on the ground with a soft plop.

As she bent to pick it up, her eyes caught a bright red official seal in the corner of the envelope.

It was... the stamp of the Military District Political Department?
###Chapter 188: An Unexpected Encounter with Margaret Lee

A long line stretched outside the Supply & Market as Emily Johnson clutched a glass bottle, squeezed among the crowd. With the New Year approaching, the shelves were unusually stocked with festive goods.

"Two pounds of fried dough twists," Emily handed over the ration coupons and added a bottle of soy sauce to her basket. The young woman beside her tugged her sleeve. "Emily, look!"

A flash of floral fabric darted past the street corner. The girl wore two neat braids, her cotton-padded jacket brand new, as she hurriedly ducked into an alley.

"Is that Margaret Lee?" Emily narrowed her eyes. The girl looked much healthier than the rumors suggested, her cheeks noticeably fuller.

The young woman lowered her voice. "She must be married now. Last year at her parents' place, she was still wearing patched-up old clothes!" Before she could finish, Margaret suddenly turned and met their gaze—then bolted.

"Why is she running?" The woman shook her head. "It's not like I'd report her. Her parents treated her like livestock. If she escaped to a better life, I’d be happy for her."

Emily recalled the somber look on Charles Clark’s face whenever he mentioned this girl. It wasn’t easy for a village girl to break free from her family. Margaret must be clever.

On the ox-cart ride back, several aunts pestered Emily about fabric. When she remained indifferent, one woman nearly snapped—then remembered what happened to Peter Wilson and immediately fell silent.

"Don’t mind them, they just love to gossip," the young woman offered Emily a piece of sesame candy. "Honestly, Margaret made the right choice. A life in town is better than being worked to the bone at home."

Meanwhile, deep in the alley, Margaret leaned against a dirt wall, panting heavily.

"What’s wrong?" Her mother-in-law rushed out from the courtyard, alarmed by her pale face. "Weren’t you buying brown sugar?"

"Mother, I ran into someone I know..." Margaret pressed a hand to her still-flat stomach, her voice trembling. "If my father finds out—"

Her mother-in-law patted her hand. "Silly girl, you’re part of our family now. Come spring, your husband will take you to transfer your household registration. They can’t stop you." She pressed a piece of peach shortbread into Margaret’s palm. "Eat something. Don’t starve my grandson."

Margaret took a bite, the sweetness melting on her tongue. This was the kind of treat she could never have dreamed of back home.
###Chapter 189: Meat Buns That Made Neighbor Kids Cry

"Emily, I'm heading home now!" Daisy Miller called out cheerfully, basket in hand as she walked briskly toward her house.

"Take care, Daisy."

Emily Johnson watched her leave before turning toward her own yard. It was amusing—though Daisy was younger, she had to address her as "sister-in-law" simply because Daisy's husband was a year older than Michael Stone.

As soon as she pushed open the gate, two little figures came barreling toward her.

"Mom's back!"

"I brought you some fried dough twists. Don't eat them all at once." Emily handed the oil-paper packet to the boys and headed straight for the kitchen with her vegetable basket.

What should she make for lunch?

A sudden craving for meat buns struck her. Too bad she couldn't buy any without ration coupons.

"David, go ask Grandma to come help make buns."

She deftly pulled two pounds of pork belly from her space and started kneading the dough. By the time she sprinkled in the yeast, the boys had already scampered out the door.

"Grandma! Mom wants you to make buns with her!"

Mary Stone was airing quilts in the yard and paused at the request. "Meat again?"

Her daughter-in-law had grown increasingly bold lately, constantly inviting them over for hearty meals. Though she pretended to grumble, her hands moved swiftly.

"Mom, I got the meat without coupons," Emily said, pointing to the pork on the cutting board. "Let's make two fillings—fresh pork and cured."

Mary's lips twitched. This extravagant girl—even buns had to be premium!

"Grandma, try a dough twist!" Tommy stretched on tiptoe to offer one.

"Sweetheart, you eat it—"

"Mom, we're teaching them filial respect," Emily said, chopping the meat. "If you refuse, they won't learn to honor their elders."

Mary blinked. Though illiterate, she couldn't deny her educated daughter-in-law's parenting skills. Her grandsons could already recite poems and do arithmetic—top of their class in the village.

"Alright, alright, Grandma will have one."

The braised pork bubbled in the pot, and the dough had risen. Mary rolled out wrappers with practiced ease while Emily tended the fire. The rich aroma of meat and steamed buns drifted beyond the yard, making the neighbor's child wail with envy.

"David, go get Grandpa for lunch."

The boys raced hand-in-hand toward the brigade office, only to encounter Henry Wood shivering on the path.

"Henry, here!" David generously shared a dough twist.

The timid boy accepted it quietly. "My stepmom sent me to find bugs for the chickens..."

"Who finds bugs in winter?" Tommy tilted his head. "You should go home!"

No one expected that single dough twist to cause trouble. By evening, a village child came running in panic:

"David! Henry's stepmom beat him till he got a fever! Noah says their house is in chaos!"

Emily's calligraphy brush clattered onto the paper, ink blooming like a dark stormcloud...
###Chapter 190: The Fried Dough Twist Incident

"Henry has a fever?" Emily Johnson set aside her needlework, her brow furrowing slightly.

Little David hung his head, nervously twisting the hem of his shirt. "Mom... I gave Henry a fried dough twist yesterday..."

"Take your time," Emily said gently, pulling her son closer.

It turned out that at noon the previous day, David had gone to call his grandfather for lunch when he spotted Henry digging for worms. Seeing his friend swallowing hard from hunger, David had secretly slipped him a fried dough twist.

"Henry said he'd share it with his little sister..." David's voice grew quieter. "But then his stepmother saw..."

Smack! Emily slammed her hand on the table and stood abruptly. "Let's go check on him."

"Auntie, Henry's stepmother is really mean!" Max, the boy who had brought the news, shrank back nervously.

Emily smirked. "Meaner than me?"

As the three approached Henry’s house, a shrill voice screeched from inside: "Stop faking it, you little brat!"

Bang! Emily kicked the gate open without hesitation.

In the yard stood a sharp-faced woman with high cheekbones, hands on her hips. Her beady eyes narrowed at the intrusion. "Well, if it isn’t Mrs. Stone!"

"Where’s Henry?" Emily scanned the area.

"None of your damn business!" The woman spat.

Seizing the chance, David darted inside. A moment later, his alarmed cry rang out: "Mom! Henry’s burning up!"

Emily’s gaze turned icy. "If my son gave him food, it’s not your place to punish him for it."

"You—!" The woman’s face darkened. "I’ll discipline my child however I please!"

"Oh?" Emily stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "I hear you’re Peter Wilson’s cousin?"

The woman stiffened.

"Perfect." Emily’s lips curved. "We can settle old scores while we’re at it."

Suddenly raising her voice, she called out, "Everyone! Come see how this stepmother abuses her own child—she’ll kill him at this rate!"

Neighbors began peering out from their homes.

Furious, the woman lunged, claws out. Emily sidestepped smoothly and delivered a stinging slap across her face.

"That was for Henry." Emily leaned in, her voice lethally soft. "Tell me... how would you like to find a snake in your bed tonight?"

The woman paled, stumbling backward.

"Now, you have two choices." Emily calmly adjusted her sleeve. "Either I take Henry to see a doctor, or..." Her gaze flicked meaningfully to the woman’s own son clutched in her arms.

"You—you wouldn’t dare!"

Emily smiled without answering and turned toward the house. Behind her came a thud—the woman collapsing to the ground, too terrified to move.


###Chapter 191: Ugly People Cause More Trouble

"Get out of my way!" Stepmother Wang kicked little Daisy aside, glaring at her viciously. "Stupid brat, always in the way!"

Daisy's frail body hit the wall, tears streaming down her face from the pain. Henry quickly shielded his sister, only for Stepmother Wang to grab his ear. "You little runt! How dare you protect her?"

Emily Johnson heard the cries from the courtyard before she even entered. Pushing open the gate, she saw Stepmother Wang raising a broom to strike the children.

"Stop!" Emily shouted sharply.

Stepmother Wang froze, then sneered when she recognized the intruder. "Well, if it isn’t the city-educated youth. What business do you have meddling in my family affairs?"

Emily strode forward and yanked the broom away. "What kind of coward bullies children?"

"I discipline my own kids—none of your concern!" Stepmother Wang planted her hands on her hips, spittle flying. "These little brats deserve a beating!"

Villagers had begun gathering, murmuring among themselves. "She beats those kids every day, and their father does nothing..."

Emily scoffed. "Discipline? More like you’re trying to kill them!" She pointed at Stepmother Wang’s pinched face. "With a face like yours, no wonder you take your ugliness out on helpless children!"

"You—!" Stepmother Wang turned livid, raising her hand to strike.

Emily caught her wrist effortlessly. "Oh? You want to hit me too?" With a firm shove, Stepmother Wang stumbled back.

"Henry’s father is back!" someone called.

Mr. Wood entered the courtyard carrying water buckets, freezing at the scene.

"Darling!" Stepmother Wang instantly switched to a pitiful wail, rushing to him. "This educated youth is bullying me!"

Emily laughed coldly. "Wow, your acting skills are impressive. But—" She eyed Mr. Wood up and down. "You two are a perfect match. One’s ugly, the other’s blind."

The crowd burst into laughter.

"What’s that supposed to mean?" Mr. Wood’s face darkened.

"What’s it mean?" Emily crossed her arms. "You let this woman abuse your children—either you’re blind, or—" She dragged out her words deliberately. "You suspect Henry and Daisy aren’t really yours?"

Gasps erupted instantly.

"No way..."
"Henry looks just like his grandma..."
"Daisy takes after her mother..."

Mr. Wood’s expression grew stormier. Stepmother Wang panicked. "You’re spouting nonsense!"

"Am I?" Emily raised her voice. "Then explain why you beat them while their father turns a blind eye? Unless—" She gave Mr. Wood a pointed look. "Someone’s been whispering in your ear that these kids aren’t yours?"

Mr. Wood went deathly pale.

"Mommy!" Tommy suddenly ran over, tugging Emily’s sleeve. "Henry’s burning up!"

Emily’s heart lurched. Abandoning the argument, she rushed inside to find Henry unconscious on the bed, his face flushed with fever.

"Get a doctor—now!" She scooped Henry up, shooting a glare at the couple in the doorway. "This isn’t over."
###Chapter 192: Emily's Fury

Emily stormed into Henry's room, the musty air making her grimace. The straw-covered bed held a small, curled-up figure, the blanket so filthy its original color was unrecognizable. She scooped Henry into her arms—his lightness sent a pang through her chest. He was even thinner than David.

"Let's go."

She marched past the couple, her voice icy. "City hospitals can run DNA tests. How can two grown adults believe such nonsense? You're being used as pawns and don’t even realize it!"

Tommy and Max hurried after her. Villagers whispered among themselves:

"Tsk, Henry’s stepmother spins quite the tale, claiming he’s not their blood. Why not say her own ugly son’s the bastard?"

"That fool of a father’s so bewitched by his wife, he’d deny his own flesh and blood!"

"Rumor has it they make quite the racket at night..."

The stepmother stamped her foot, face red with rage. "Get out! All of you!"

As the crowd dispersed, Henry’s father stood frozen.

"Darling..." The stepmother clutched her swollen cheek. "We should demand compensation from Emily! Her family’s rich!"

The man stared at her, suddenly recalling she’d been the first to claim the boy wasn’t his...

"Darling?" Panic flickered in her eyes. Had he actually believed that wretched woman?

At the clinic, Emily rushed in with Henry. "Doctor, quick!"

Daisy clung to her brother’s hand, tears streaming. "Mom, is Henry going to die?"

The village doctor’s expression darkened after the examination. "The fever’s dangerously high." He lifted Henry’s collar, revealing bruises. "These injuries..."

Emily’s fists clenched, nails digging into her palms. She hadn’t hit them hard enough earlier.

"I’ll fetch medicine from home. Stay here."

The three children nodded solemnly.

The doctor sighed, turning to prepare herbs. What kind of father would beat his own child like this?

"David, how’s Henry?" John Stone Sr. arrived breathlessly.

"Grandpa, he’s still unconscious," David said, eyes red.

John’s heart sank. If the fever damaged the boy’s brain, his daughter-in-law would face serious consequences.

He turned to the trembling girl in the corner. "Daisy, where’s your father?"

The child shrank back, tears falling like raindrops.
###Chapter 193: Temporary Help Isn't Enough

The biting wind made Daisy's small frame appear even more fragile. Her patched cotton coat, washed to a pale hue, did little to ward off the cold. Her cheeks were flushed red with both chill and worry.

"Father didn't come..." Daisy's voice was barely audible. "Auntie carried Henry here to see the doctor."

John Stone Sr.'s brow furrowed. Henry's father was utterly irresponsible—how could he neglect his own son running such a high fever? What if the boy took a turn for the worse?

Emily Johnson retrieved several packets of fever-reducing powder from her medicine kit. The pink granules dissolved in the enamel mug, releasing a faintly sweet aroma.

"Mom..." Little David stretched on his tiptoes, eager to help.

"Father..." Emily only then noticed her father-in-law had accompanied them. Gently, she lifted the unconscious Henry, carefully tipping the medicine into his mouth.

Though unconscious, Henry managed to swallow. Relieved, Emily dampened a cloth and pressed it to his forehead to cool him down.

"Father, you should go tend to your duties. I can handle things here," Emily said softly.

John Stone Sr. gazed at the two children, his heart heavy. They could offer temporary help, but not a permanent solution.

Henry's father was still alive—this was ultimately his responsibility.

"Mm." John turned to leave, already planning to have his wife intervene. His daughter-in-law had a kind heart, but this situation was more complicated than simple charity.

Before long, Henry's eyelids fluttered open.

"Brother!" Daisy threw herself at the bedside, tears spilling down her cheeks.

Henry blinked dazedly at his surroundings, his throat burning.

"Drink some water first." Emily handed him a cup. "Are you hungry?"

David immediately dug a few biscuits from his pocket. "I've got food!"

Emily added some sponge cakes to the offering. "Eat a little to settle your stomach."

When the village doctor entered with a bowl of medicine, he found the children nibbling quietly on the treats.

"The fever's broken—that's what matters." He passed the medicine to Emily. "Three cents."

After paying, Emily helped Henry to his feet. "Can you walk?"

Henry swayed the moment he stood, but Emily caught him just in time.

"Take it slow." With one hand holding Tommy and the other steadying Henry, Emily's heart remained weighed down.

Meanwhile, Mary Stone slammed her palm on the table after hearing her husband's account. "That good-for-nothing! I'll give him a piece of my mind!"

She snatched up a rolling pin and stormed toward the door, only for John to pull her back. "Hold on—"

Outside, the wind howled, scattering dead leaves in its wake like a voiceless sigh.
###Chapter 194: Explosive Gossip

"They're trying to pin this on Michael's wife!" Mary Stone fumed, grabbing a broom and storming toward the Wilson household.

Inside, Lily Wilson, Henry’s stepmother, was throwing a tantrum. "We have to get that Emily Johnson to pay!" she shrieked.

Henry’s father, George Wilson, sat on the doorstep, puffing on his pipe, ignoring Lily’s hysterics. Their youngest son played in the yard, oblivious to the chaos.

"You two have the nerve to sit here doing nothing?" Mary kicked the gate open. "A father who doesn’t care if his son lives or dies, and a stepmother who’d rather see the child sick—what kind of monsters are you?"

She seized Lily by the collar. "Lily Wilson, you think no one remembers the shameful things you did to get married?"

Lily paled. "Y-You’re lying!"

"Lying?" Mary sneered. "Should I remind you how you cornered Butcher Zhang in the cornfield?"

Thud. George’s pipe hit the ground. He slapped Lily hard across the face. "You shameless woman!"

Gasps erupted from beyond the fence. Several women eavesdropping nearly fell off the wall—this was juicy gossip.

"Get your son to the clinic now!" Mary kicked George. "If your mother knew you’d abandoned your own flesh and blood, she’d rise from her grave!"

George finally scrambled away in panic. Before leaving, Mary spat at Lily. "Enjoy being the village laughingstock!"

True to her word, within hours, the rumors spread like wildfire:
"Did you hear? Lily Wilson in the cornfield—"
"Worse! They say she seduced three men!"
"No wonder she treats Henry and Daisy so cruelly..."

Meanwhile, the comforting aroma of meat buns filled Emily’s home.
"Eat while they’re hot." Emily handed plump buns to Henry.
The boy clutched them nervously, while Daisy swallowed hard, eyes wide.

"Go on!" David broke his bun in half. "Grandma’s meat buns are the best!"

The children took small, reverent bites, as if savoring a feast.

The gate burst open. George and Mary rushed in, panting. Henry hid his bun behind his back, and Daisy choked in fright.

"Easy now." Emily patted Daisy’s back, then leveled a cold stare at the intruders. "Can I help you?"

(Cliffhanger: How will Emily handle George’s aggression? Will the children escape their nightmare? And just how far will Lily’s scandal spread?)
###Chapter 195: The Truth Revealed?

Emily Johnson looked up to meet her mother-in-law's anxious gaze. To her surprise, Mary Stone had personally brought Henry's father over.

"I was wrong," the man admitted, his voice thick with regret. "I shouldn't have forgotten about your grandmother."

Henry froze. Grandmother? He'd never met her.

"Henry, you look just like her. It's called atavism," his father explained.

The boy clenched the hem of his shirt. His stepmother always claimed he wasn't a true Wood, insisting he bore no resemblance to his father.

"Am I really yours?" Henry's voice trembled.

His father pulled him into a tight embrace. "Of course you are! You're my own flesh and blood!"

Emily's heart skipped a beat. Her earlier suspicions had been correct.

"Take your children home and care for them properly," Mary sighed, eyeing the thin frames of the siblings. "Look how skinny they are, and their clothes are practically rags."

Henry's father nodded eagerly. "Thank you for looking after them, Miss Johnson. I'll take them home now."

"Auntie, we're leaving," Henry said politely, knowing they couldn't keep troubling her.

"Go ahead." Emily ruffled his hair. "If anyone gives you trouble, come find me anytime."

She shot a meaningful glance at Henry's father as she spoke.

After the family departed, Mary pulled Emily aside. "I know you mean well, but that stepmother is trouble. She only married into that family because she was too plain to find a husband otherwise."

Emily's eyes widened. No wonder the woman had such a spiteful face.

"She's demanding compensation from you too! As if!" Mary spat. "That sort isn't worth your concern."

"I understand, Mother." Emily nodded obediently.

Only then did Mary leave with peace of mind.

Silence settled over the house. The two younger children peeked at their mother nervously, hardly daring to breathe. Was she angry?

Meanwhile, Henry's father had barely crossed the threshold with his son when Lily Wilson's icy glare met them.

"What a convincing act!" she shrilled. "Too weak to stand earlier, but now you can walk?"

Ignoring her, the man carried Henry to the inner room. He returned with a fresh quilt.

"What do think you're doing?" Lily blocked his path. "Giving our good quilt to that bastard?"
###Chapter 196: The Weight of Tradition

"Mom, not this again," Lin Xiaoyue set down her chopsticks, her appetite for the braised pork vanishing.

"You're twenty-eight. If you don't marry soon, the village will talk." Her mother nudged a piece of steamed fish into her bowl. "The Wangs' daughter, two years younger than you, already has a child running errands."

Xiaoyue stared at the glistening fish but couldn't bring herself to eat. Outside the window, the setting sun stretched the old locust tree's shadow across the yard.

"I have a good job in the city. Nobody cares about these things anymore—"

"Good job?" Her father slammed the table. "A proper young woman shouldn't flaunt herself like this! Your cousin married a civil servant—and she's just a nurse!"

Her grip tightened around the chopsticks. She thought of the coworker who always hovered too close, the manager's pointed remarks about her "biological clock." City people pretended to be progressive, but their expectations were just as suffocating.

"Dad, times have changed—"

"Changed?" He scoffed. "Your cousin Fang got married last year and is already showing. Meanwhile, you don't even have a boyfriend!"

A dog barked outside. The neighbor's TV blared the evening news. The house she'd lived in for twenty years suddenly felt alien.

"I'm leaving for the city tomorrow." Her voice was quiet but firm.

Her mother flustered. "Child, how can you—"

"Let her go!" Her father stood abruptly. "See if we care!"

Xiaoyue turned to pack. The red winter coat she'd bought last New Year still hung in the closet, its brightness mocking her. Her fingers brushed the train ticket in its pocket.

Beyond the window, the last sliver of sunlight surrendered to the night.

"Stop right there!" Lily Wilson stamped her foot in frustration, but Henry's father stormed past her without a backward glance, heading straight for Henry's room.

"That's my quilt!" She reached out to snatch it back but was shoved so hard she nearly lost her balance.

"Henry is my son too!" His father's eyes burned red. "What, only the children you bore deserve to be called my sons? The ones my late wife gave me don't count?"

Lily froze.

Hadn't everyone said Henry didn’t resemble him at all?

Why was he suddenly claiming him now?

That gossipy wife of the brigade leader must have opened her big mouth!

"Lily Wilson, I'm making myself clear today." Henry's father's voice shook. "Either you shape up and act right, or pack your bags and crawl back to your parents' house!"

Divorce?

The word struck Lily like lightning.

If she were sent back in disgrace, where would she go? With her plain looks, who would have married her if not for becoming a stepmother?

"I... I never said I wouldn’t acknowledge him..."

After all her earlier bluster, she could only swallow her pride now.

In the countryside, divorce was the ultimate shame.

From that day on, Henry and Daisy finally had their father's protection.

But no one could have predicted the greater storm brewing on the horizon.

"If she wants to come back, fine. If not, forget it." Mr. Johnson's face was stony, his cigarette crushed tightly between his fingers.

Mrs. Johnson opened her mouth but didn’t dare argue.

Getting leave wasn’t easy—the round-trip train ride alone would take four or five days.

Their youngest daughter had been in the countryside for years. Who knew what she’d become?

"Understood," she murmured. "While you’re at the factory... keep an eye out for potential matches. Emily isn’t getting any younger..."

Mr. Johnson snorted. "By her age, I already had our second child running around!"

When the eldest daughter-in-law heard her mother-in-law was going to fetch Emily, her grin nearly split her face.

Once the girl was back, she’d find a way to make her father-in-law agree.

Then...

The thought of becoming the factory director’s wife by next year sent bubbles of delight fizzing through her.

"Mom, after all these years in the countryside, Emily must be bitter," the eldest daughter-in-law said with feigned concern. "But coming back to the city now is what’s best for her..."

Didn’t Mrs. Johnson know that?

The college entrance exams had been reinstated for two years, but how easy was it to get into university?

For a girl, returning to the city and marrying well while she was still young was the sensible path.

The eldest daughter-in-law spun more honeyed words, each sentence dripping with sisterly concern.

But the calculating gleam in her eyes was impossible to hide.

The train clattered onward.

Mrs. Johnson stared out the window, her palms damp with sweat at the thought of seeing her daughter soon.

"Wife! Disaster!" The second son burst into the house in a panic. "Mom’s gone to pick up Emily!"

The second daughter-in-law leisurely cracked sunflower seeds between her teeth. "Isn’t that good? You’re always saying you feel guilty about her."

"But... but the eldest brother’s workshop director position is about to be promoted!" The second son wrung his hands. "At a time like this..."

The seeds slipped from the second daughter-in-law’s fingers and clattered to the floor.

Working as a salesclerk at the department store, she knew all the underhanded tricks.

"You mean... the eldest sister-in-law plans to use Emily’s marriage...?"

"Exactly!" The second son stomped his foot. "Everyone praises her as the perfect wife, but her schemes could fill a sieve!"
###Chapter 197: Sibling Rift

"Brother, let me explain!" My little sister clutched my sleeve, her eyes red-rimmed.

I shook her off with a cold laugh. "Explain what? How you conspired with outsiders against me?"

She bit her lip, tears welling up. "It's not like that... Uncle Lee said—"

"Enough!"

I slammed my hand on the table, rattling the teacup.

"You believe everything Uncle Lee says? If he told you to jump off a cliff, would you?" My voice trembled with fury. "After all these years of providing for you—food, clothes, school—this is how you repay me?"

She staggered back, tears finally spilling over.

"Brother, I truly didn’t know—"

"Didn’t know?" I sneered. "Well, now you do. Uncle Lee can’t stand seeing us united. He’s deliberately driving us apart!"

Outside, lightning split the sky as rain poured down.

Suddenly, she lifted her head. "But... Uncle Lee said... about Mom and Dad’s death—"

My pupils constricted.

"Shut up!" I seized her wrist. "One more word, and you’re no longer my sister!"

My ferocious expression drained the color from her face.

Just then, a phone rang sharply.

The caller ID flashed: Uncle Lee.

"What exactly is our sister-in-law plotting?" The second Mrs. Yun frowned, her fingers tapping unconsciously on the table. "Go and find out. When Emily returns, we'll be prepared."

Find out?

The second Mr. Yun felt a surge of irritation. Half the reason for his strained relationship with his parents was his status as a live-in son-in-law, and the other half was entirely due to the first Mrs. Yun.

The second Mrs. Yun had been his high school classmate. Her mother had suffered a premature birth due to a shove from her in-laws, leaving her unable to bear children again. Fortunately, her father was a chef at a state-run restaurant, and her mother worked as a sales clerk at a department store—their family was well-off. The second Mrs. Yun had taken over her mother's job after she retired.

The next day, the second Mr. Yun returned with news.

"Darling, I found out." His expression darkened. "The deputy director of their factory has a crippled son who throws his weight around because of his father's influence. That guy's divorced and looking for a pretty stepmother. Our sister-in-law is truly despicable!"

The second Mrs. Yun mused, "Emily's been in the countryside for six years. Could she already be married?"

What she didn’t dare say aloud was: After years of exposure to the elements, that delicate girl from before had likely changed beyond recognition.

"Surely not?" The second Mr. Yun recalled the sweet way his sister used to call him "Second Brother," but he wasn’t sure. Emily was stubborn—otherwise, they wouldn’t have been so thoroughly outmaneuvered by their sister-in-law.

Their father was a factory director, their mother an accountant—they could have easily afforded to buy Emily a job. But after their sister-in-law gave birth to two sons, their parents' favoritism had shifted.

"If she's married, our sister-in-law's plan will fall through." The second Mrs. Yun suggested, "When Emily returns to the city, you meet her alone. I'll talk to her."

She had never met this sister-in-law. By the time she and the second Mr. Yun started dating, Emily had already been sent to the countryside.

"Fine. Go wash the clothes first." His tone softened.

Their marriage was a happy one. The second Mrs. Yun’s family was well-off, and her parents treated him like their own son. Her mother even took care of their three children.

"Right away." As she stood, a cold smile flickered at the corner of her lips. She was curious to see just how capable this sister-in-law of hers really was.

Meanwhile, in Stone Village.

After lying in bed for a long time, Robert Stone finally decided to go to town to have his leg injury checked.

"Big Brother, you're going to town too?" On the oxcart, Elizabeth Stone was surprised to see Emily Johnson.

"Yeah, to see about my leg." Robert forced a smile.

Elizabeth studied Emily. "Sister-in-law, are you shopping for New Year's supplies?"

New Year's supplies? Emily scoffed inwardly. She was just bored and wanted to stroll around town.
###Chapter 198: The Urgent Telegram

"Miss!" Qingzhu rushed into the courtyard in a panic, clutching a telegram in her hand. "An urgent telegram from Second Young Master Yun!"

I was sitting on the porch, embroidering, when the needle nearly pricked my finger at her sudden exclamation. Looking up, I saw Qingzhu's face had gone pale, beads of sweat glistening at her temples.

"What happened?" I set aside the embroidery frame, an uneasy feeling rising in my chest.

Qingzhu hurried over in three quick strides and handed me the telegram. "Second Young Master says... Eldest Young Master was ambushed in the military camp. His injuries are severe..."

The paper trembled slightly in my grasp. The handwriting was messier than usual, each word sharp as a blade: Brother ambushed—gravely wounded. Come to the military hospital at once.

I shot to my feet, the embroidery frame clattering to the ground, threads scattering everywhere.

"Prepare the carriage!" My voice was tight. "We leave for the train station immediately!"

Qingzhu hesitated. "But Miss, it's already late—"

"That doesn't matter now!" I strode toward the house. "Pack some clothes and medical supplies. Quickly!"

Just as I stepped inside, the sound of urgent hoofbeats echoed from outside the courtyard. My heart lurched. Turning back, I saw a chestnut horse galloping toward us—and atop it...

"Second Brother Yun?!"

"Emily, heading to town?" Elizabeth Stone rubbed her hands together, her breath forming little clouds in the cold air.

Emily Johnson tightened her scarf and exhaled. "Yes, just picking up some New Year's supplies."

The ox cart was packed with villagers. This year, the production team had distributed earnings, and everyone was eager to stock up for the holidays. The Stone family, however, was still recovering from building their new house, having exchanged work points for grain, leaving them short on cash.

Elizabeth hesitated, then lowered her voice. "Sister-in-law... if you happen to find fabric without coupons..."

Emily smiled. "That depends on luck. The ready-made clothes I bought for David and Tommy were pricey, but at least they didn’t require coupons."

Elizabeth’s shoulders slumped. With two daughters still in school, she couldn’t justify the expense.

When they reached town, Emily steadied Robert as he struggled with his crutch, his injured leg barely able to bear weight.

"No need, no need," he waved her off.

The crowd quickly dispersed, rushing to queue at the Supply & Market. Emily turned toward the post office—she’d spotted a set of stamps a few days ago, reasonably priced and perfect for her collection.

"Emily!" The clerk called out. "There’s a telegram for you."

A telegram? Her heart skipped a beat. Unfolding the thin paper, she read the single line:

"Mom is coming to your sister-in-law’s to bring you home for marriage."

Her hands trembled slightly. Was this... her birth family?

The original novel had barely mentioned them, only noting that the protagonist had fled back to them. Now, with the plot altered, they were seeking her out instead?

"How much for this stamp set?" She forced calm into her voice.

"Twelve-eighty." The clerk studied her. "Collecting?"

Emily paid and carefully tucked the stamps away. Stepping outside, the wind bit into her cheeks.

Where was her birth family from? How many days by train? How close were they already? Questions exploded in her mind.

I can’t go back. She gritted her teeth. I need a plan...

"I love Michael. No one will tear us apart," she whispered, as if steeling herself.

Firecrackers crackled in the distance, the festive atmosphere thickening. But the unexpected telegram sat like a block of ice, heavy and cold in her chest.
###Chapter 199: She Didn't Want to Go

"I'm not going."

Su Nian gently placed the invitation back on the coffee table, her fingertips trembling slightly.

It was an exquisitely crafted card with gilded edges, bearing the embossed words "Gu Corporation Anniversary Gala" in bold gold lettering. Just the sight of those words made her chest tighten.

"Why?" Gu Chen stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his tall silhouette backlit by the fading sunlight. "This is the most important event for the corporation."

"I know." Su Nian lowered her lashes, her voice barely audible. "But I just don't want to go."

Her fingers clenched the fabric of her skirt. The expensive evening gown—specially chosen by Gu Chen—lay untouched on the bed in the bedroom.

Gu Chen turned, his brow furrowing slightly. "What are you worried about?"

"Nothing." She averted her gaze, avoiding his probing eyes. "I just... don't feel well."

Outside, the sunset painted the city in shades of orange and gold. Staring at the distant skyscrapers, she suddenly remembered the disdainful glances from the socialites at the last Gu Corporation banquet.

"Which family does Miss Su belong to?"
"I heard she met Mr. Gu at a nightclub..."

Those whispered remarks had cut into her like knives.

"Su Nian." Gu Chen stepped closer, his voice low. "Look at me."

Reluctantly, she raised her eyes to meet his dark, fathomless gaze.

"No one would dare disrespect you." His long fingers brushed her cheek. "You're my woman."

She bit her lower lip. The words should have reassured her, but instead, they only deepened her unease.

"Give me a reason." His tone left no room for refusal.

She drew a shaky breath. "I'm afraid... I'll embarrass you."

The moment the words left her lips, Gu Chen's expression turned icy.

"Who said that?" Danger laced his voice. "Give me a name."

Su Nian shook her head. "No one did. It's just me—"

Before she could finish, he pulled her into his arms. The crisp, cool scent of his cologne enveloped her.

"Listen," he murmured against her ear, his warm breath grazing her skin. "Tonight, I want everyone to know that you're the only woman I acknowledge."

Her heart skipped a beat. His embrace was so tight she could barely breathe.

"Now," he released her, a determined smirk curving his lips, "go get dressed."

He turned toward the walk-in closet, his retreating figure radiating unyielding resolve.

Su Nian stood frozen, her pulse pounding like thunder.

She knew—this gala would be anything but peaceful.

Emily Johnson couldn't wait to sever ties with the original villainess's family. That way, she could finally escape those exhausting plotlines.

After all, she was now living as the villainess. Getting tangled in those melodramatic twists would be nothing but a headache.

She had no intention of wading into that mess.

Life was perfect as it was—she'd gained two adorable children, and even if she divorced Michael Stone later, retirement wouldn't be an issue.

With her PennyDeals advantage, her days couldn't be more comfortable.

Today was a big day—New Year shopping.

She couldn't miss it.

Rumor had it that the Supply & Market would release a batch of industrial goods during the holiday. No coupons were needed, but it was first-come, first-served. Only the luckiest would snag anything.

Emily hurried excitedly to the Supply & Market.

But when she arrived and saw the two snaking lines, her enthusiasm instantly waned.

This was worse than the queues at modern trendy bubble tea shops!

Should she wait or not?

Gritting her teeth, she decided to stay. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to explain any extra items at home.

"No coupons, line up here! With coupons, over there!"

A clerk stood on a stool, shouting hoarsely.

The line for those with coupons was noticeably shorter. Emily patted the coupons in her pocket and decisively joined the shorter queue.

After a successful shopping spree, she not only used up all her coupons but also managed to grab several high-demand items without needing them. Carefully covering her haul, she headed toward the oxcart, satisfied.

"Uncle, have some candy."

She had bought two pounds of fruit candies and casually handed a handful to the driver, a relative from her husband's family.

"Emily, are the others still at the Supply & Market?"

"The line for those without coupons is too long. They'll probably be a while."

Just then, Elizabeth Stone helped her husband Robert approach from the direction of the clinic. Robert's leg was freshly bandaged and medicated.

"Done shopping already?" Elizabeth's eyes gleamed as she eyed Emily's bulging basket.

"Yeah, got quite a bit. Want some fruit candy? I can spare a pound for you."

Hearing it required no coupons, Elizabeth perked up. With four kids at home, she'd been worried about not having enough sweets for the New Year.

"Yes, please!"

"Alright, I'll have David bring it over later."

Seeing no other villagers around, Elizabeth leaned in and whispered, "Emily, is there anything else you can share?"

Emily raised an eyebrow. Pushing her luck?

"What else do you want?"

Elizabeth rubbed her hands together. "Do you have any oil?"

She remembered Emily had given her mother-in-law a bottle before.

"Nope."

Elizabeth clearly didn’t believe her, her eyes darting toward the basket.

Emily set the basket down. "How about this—I have a bag of Malt Extract at home. Want it?"

"Malt Extract?" Elizabeth swallowed hard.

"Since you got paid this time, and Robert needs nutrition for his injury. Five dollars. Deal?"

Five dollars! Robert immediately waved his hands. "No, no need..."
###Chapter 200: The Grateful Little Angel

Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains. Lin Xiaonuan rubbed her sleepy eyes and noticed a handmade card resting on her pillow.

The card featured a crooked drawing of three figures—a little girl with a ponytail standing in the middle, holding hands with two adults on either side. Beneath it, written in colorful crayon, were the words: "Thank you, Sister Lin, for saving my mom."

Her eyes welled up instantly. This was from the daughter of the car accident victim she had treated last week.

Her mind flashed back to that rainy night. The emergency room lights had been blindingly bright. The little girl had been curled up on a bench in the hallway, clutching a tattered cloth doll to her chest.

"Sister, is my mom going to die?" Her large, innocent eyes had been filled with terror.

Lin Xiaonuan had knelt down and gently wiped away her tears. "No, sweetheart. I promise."

Now, the sun on the card beamed brightly—just like the little girl’s smile when she learned her mother was out of danger.

Carefully, she tucked the card into the deepest corner of her drawer, where seventeen similar thank-you notes were already neatly stacked.

Behind each one lay a family given a second chance at life.

The phone suddenly rang. The head nurse’s urgent voice crackled through: "Xiaonuan, we need you in OR Three!"

She cast one last glance at the smiling sun on the card before turning and sprinting toward the elevator, her white coat billowing behind her.

Today’s sunlight felt especially warm.

Maltose Creamer wasn't cheap.

Elizabeth Stone pursed her lips and fell silent.

Her sister-in-law was clearly doing this on purpose—only asking about the expensive items.

"How about some canned fruit?"

"No."

"White Rabbit Candy?"

"No."

Elizabeth gritted her teeth in frustration.

"Sister-in-law, it's not that I don’t want to share. You're the one refusing."

Old Man Stone, who was driving the oxcart, listened to their exchange, his gaze lingering on Robert Stone’s injured leg. It hadn’t been long since the family split, and already trouble had struck.

Just by looking at their clothes, it was obvious which households were doing well and which were struggling.

"Thank you for thinking of us," Robert said, though he felt slighted. They truly couldn’t afford Maltose Creamer.

Another ten minutes passed before everyone had arrived.

"Emily, you’ve bought quite a lot," someone remarked.

Emily Johnson smiled faintly. "The New Year is coming, and since we rarely get to town, I stocked up on some supplies. What did you all buy?"

"Things that don’t require ration coupons are scarce. I only got some hard candies..."

As soon as the oxcart stopped, Emily hoisted her basket and hurried home.

"Mom’s back!"

There was a little guest in the house.

"Ethan?"

"Hello, sister-in-law!"

The two boys circled around their mother excitedly.

Emily pulled out a bag of fruit candies and poured half into David’s hands. "Take your brother and bring these to Uncle Robert."

She gave the rest to Ethan.

"Sister-in-law..."

"Take them. These don’t need coupons. Consider it my New Year’s gift to you."

Ethan fished out a crumpled dollar bill to give her.

"You want to pay me for a gift? Put that away."

Emily turned to her sons. "Go and come back quickly."

"Sister-in-law, I’ll head home now." Clutching the candies, Ethan resolved to help her family more often.

What a sensible child.

After seeing them off, Emily began organizing the New Year’s supplies.

Gifts for her in-laws: pastries, candies, and a bottle of liquor.

The glass bottle of cheap liquor she’d bought online—soaking it in water would peel off the label.

Two pounds of egg cakes, a bag of sugar, five pounds of noodles, and a bottle of oil.

When David and Tommy returned, they were clutching fifty cents.

"Come on, let’s deliver these to Grandma."

"Mom, what’s a New Year’s gift?"

The mother and sons walked toward the old house, carrying the basket.

"Emily, bringing something to your mother-in-law?" someone called out along the way.

"Yes."

"Emily’s so filial now, always sending things to her in-laws."

"Why wasn’t she this generous before?"

"Back then, the whole family lived together. Anything she gave would just get divided between the sisters-in-law. Who’d want that?"

"Fair point."

When they reached the old house, Mary Stone was about to start cooking when she saw them enter with the basket.
###Chapter 201: Margaret Johnson Arrives at Stone Village

The morning mist still lingered when an understated yet luxurious carriage rolled down the muddy country path. The curtain lifted slightly, revealing the elegant profile of Margaret Johnson, the matriarch of the Johnson family.

"Madam, we're approaching Stone Village," the coachman murmured.

Margaret tapped the windowsill lightly, her gaze sweeping over the dilapidated thatched cottages in the distance. She had deliberately dressed plainly today, wearing only a white jade hairpin, yet her noble bearing remained unmistakable.

Under the old locust tree at the village entrance, washerwomen gasped and dropped their wooden basins. Never had they seen such refined elegance. Their floral skirts splattered with mud, they craned their necks to gawk.

"Madam—" The village chief stumbled forward, knees buckling as if to kneel.

Margaret raised a hand to stop him. "No need for formalities." Her calm voice sent a chill down his spine. "I heard there's a Miss Stone in your village..."

Meanwhile, in the Stone family courtyard, Emily was tiptoeing to hang freshly gathered herbs when a commotion outside drew her attention. Turning, she saw a gilded carriage parked beyond the fence. Sunlight glinted off the jade bells hanging from its eaves, their tinkling startling the sparrows perched nearby.

"Young lady." Margaret stood three paces away, her emerald bracelet catching the morning light. "Might we speak privately?"

Emily's fingers still carried the scent of herbs. She wiped them absently on her apron, recognizing the bracelet—identical to the one the Johnson heiress had worn at the flower-viewing banquet three days prior.

A clay pot shattered in the kitchen. Mary Stone rushed out, pale-faced, shielding her daughter. "M-Madam..."

Margaret's eyes suddenly welled with tears. Trembling, she drew half a mutton-fat jade pendant from her sleeve. In the sunlight, the engraved characters "Bright Moon" were clearly visible.

"Eighteen years..." The noblewoman's voice broke. "My Bright Moon..."

"Why isn't the old man back yet?" Mary Stone glanced at the darkening sky, her brow furrowing slightly.

"Mother, here." Emily Johnson handed her a basket. "I ran into a peddler at the market today and bought some nice things."

Mary took the basket, her arm dipping under its weight. "Goodness, this is heavy!"

Lifting the cloth cover, she found it packed full.

"David, Tommy..." John Stone Sr. had just stepped inside when he spotted his grandsons circling the basket while his wife held the heavy load.

"Why so much?"

"It's for you both." Emily pulled out a liquor bottle. "Father, I heard this is good quality. Try it. If you like it, I'll bring more next time."

Liquor?

John had three sons, yet none had ever bought him alcohol. Now his daughter-in-law remembered.

"Then I'll savor it properly." He rubbed his hands together, eyes gleaming.

"Mother, please put these away," Emily said softly.

Mary inventoried the contents: sponge cake, sugar, oil, noodles, liquor... and the meat her youngest son had sent days earlier.

These gifts were far too generous.

"Stay for lunch," Mary sighed.

"Of course."

Only after John happily carried his liquor bottle to the main room did Mary take the basket to the kitchen.

Lunch was unusually lavish: golden crispy pancakes, savory preserved pork pies, silky steamed egg custard...

Returning from the old house, Emily settled the children for their nap before retreating to her room with a telegram clutched in hand.

What was coming would come. She took a deep breath and gazed out the window.

Margaret Johnson disembarked the train, transferred to a bus to the county seat, then hitched a ride to town as dusk fell. Rather than rushing to Stone Village, she checked into a guesthouse using her reference letter.

The shabby room made her frown, but she had no choice.

At dawn, she bought two steamed buns at the state-run diner and asked directions to Stone Village. Halfway there, she caught a ride on an oxcart before continuing on foot as villagers had instructed.

Entering the village, she looked around blankly. "Comrade, where's the educated youth dormitory?"

"That way, about seven minutes' walk."

Seven minutes? Margaret thanked them and trudged toward the dormitory with her luggage.

Peeling earthen walls, low tiled roofs. Standing before the courtyard gate, Margaret's heart ached: Emily lived here?

"Who's there?" Olivia Parker grew alert seeing a well-dressed middle-aged woman enter.

"I'm looking for Emily Johnson."

"Emily hasn't lived here for years." Olivia studied her. "What business do you have?"

"I'm her mother."

Olivia blinked. "Let me take you there."

"Thank you." Margaret forced a smile. "And you are?"

"Olivia Parker. Just call me Olivia."

As they walked, Olivia wondered: Emily had been married for years, yet her family had never visited?
###Chapter 202: Margaret Learns of Her Daughter's Wedding

"What? Emily is getting married?" The teacup slipped from Margaret's fingers, shattering on the floor. Her face turned deathly pale, her lips trembling slightly.

The maid, Daisy, stood nervously nearby. "Madam, it... it was Miss Emily herself who said it..."

"Impossible!" Margaret shot to her feet, her silk skirt knocking over a vase on the side table. "She doesn't even have a boyfriend! How could she suddenly be getting married?"

A flash of lightning outside illuminated her ashen face. Her fingers dug into the armrest of the sofa, her knuckles turning white.

"Who is it?" Margaret's voice shook. "When did this happen?"

Daisy kept her head bowed. "They say it's... the second son of the Gu family from the capital. The wedding is set for the eighth of next month."

"The Gu family?" Margaret staggered back two steps. "That notorious playboy?" A sudden realization made her expression darken further. "Wait, the eighth of next month... isn't that—"

The butler rushed in. "Madam, the master wants to see you in the study immediately!"

Straightening her collar, Margaret forced herself to appear composed as she climbed the stairs. With each step, her heartbeat quickened. When she pushed open the study door, her husband's face was stormy.

"Your precious daughter!" Henry slammed a letter onto the desk. "How dare she arrange her own marriage without consulting us!"

Margaret's hands trembled as she picked up the letter. Her daughter's familiar handwriting leaped out at her:

"Mom, Dad, please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye. I've married the second son of the Gu family. We're deeply in love..."

The letter slipped from her fingers. Suddenly, she remembered Emily's odd behavior three days ago—the hesitant look in her eyes, that mysterious late-night phone call...

"Prepare the car!" Margaret whirled around and rushed toward the door. "I'm going to ask that foolish girl myself!"

Rain began pelting against the car windows as they sped away. Margaret stared blankly at the blurred scenery outside, her nails digging into her palms. She never imagined her obedient daughter would do something like this.

What chilled her even more—just weeks ago, the Gu family's second son had been embroiled in scandal with the heiress of the Zhao family...

The early summer sunlight streamed through the window as Emily Johnson guided her two little boys' hands in writing practice. A sudden knock at the door made her fingers pause mid-stroke.

"Mommy, who is it?" David asked, tilting his round face upward.

Emily set down the brush. "Go play in your room. Don't come out until I call you."

After the children disappeared into the inner chamber, she took a steadying breath before opening the door. Olivia Parker stood there with a travel-worn middle-aged woman whose familiar features made Emily's pulse quicken.

"Emily..." Margaret Johnson's voice trembled.

Her daughter wore a light floral blouse, her raven hair loosely tied back, skin so pale it seemed translucent. This was nothing like the sun-weathered farm wife she'd imagined.

"Come in." Emily stepped aside.

The cobblestone path wound through the tidy courtyard where emerald cabbage sprouts bordered the walls. Margaret's sharp eyes noted the well-built brick house, already piecing together the truth.

"Tea." Emily offered a steaming cup of jasmine tea.

Margaret clutched the cup, fingertips burning. "You...married?"

Silence thickened until the bubbling teapot sounded unnaturally loud. Emily watched tea leaves swirl in her cup. "Yes."

"When?" Margaret's voice rose sharply. "Why didn't you tell us?"

A rustling sound came from the doorway. Emily shifted subtly to block the view of two small faces peeking through the crack.

"Three years ago." Her tone remained calm. "I'm happy here. Not planning to return to the city."

The teacup slammed onto the table, splashing droplets. Just as Margaret drew breath to protest, a sharp "clack" sounded from the inner room—like a toy hitting the floor.

"Who's there?" Margaret stood abruptly.

Emily's fingers dug into her palms.
###Chapter 203: The Debt of Motherhood

"Mom, I'm home."

Lin Xiao pushed open the door to find her mother sitting blankly on the sofa. A half-drunk cup of cold tea sat on the coffee table, and the ashtray overflowed with cigarette butts.

"You're smoking again?" She frowned, walking over to crack open a window.

Mrs. Lin looked up as if startled awake, her fingers absently tracing the armrest. "Xiao... when did you get back?"

"Just now." Lin Xiao set down her bag and sat beside her mother. "The doctor said your lungs—"

"I know." Mrs. Lin cut her off, suddenly gripping her daughter's hand. "Xiao, I owe you an apology."

Lin Xiao froze.

Her mother's hands were cold, the knuckles lined with wrinkles. Only then did she notice the new streaks of silver at her mother's temples.

"Why bring this up now?"

"I was cleaning today and found your childhood photos." Mrs. Lin's voice trembled. "That time you had a high fever at five... I was away on business..."

Lin Xiao's chest tightened.

That night remained etched in her memory—the 40-degree fever, the frantic nanny, and her mother's distant voice on the phone saying, "Just call a doctor."

"It's in the past," she murmured.

"No, it isn't." Mrs. Lin's voice turned urgent. "All these years, I missed your first recital, your graduation, even..."

Her words dissolved into silent tears.

Lin Xiao had never seen her mother like this—the formidable businesswoman now fragile as a child.

"Mom..."

"You must hate me." Mrs. Lin wiped her face. "When your father passed, I didn't even make it to the funeral."

Rain began pattering against the window, mirroring the sobs from that funeral decades ago.

Lin Xiao drew a steadying breath. "I don't hate you."

She pulled her trembling mother into an embrace—one twenty years overdue.

"I just... really missed you."

The downpour drowned their quiet weeping. On the coffee table, a framed photo showed a five-year-old girl beaming at the camera, while the mother holding her stared at a stack of work documents.

"You're really married?" Mrs. Johnson's voice trembled slightly, the teacup nearly slipping from her grasp. She never imagined her beloved youngest daughter would secretly marry a country man without telling the family.

Emily nodded, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her cup. "Mom, I'm happy here."

"Happy?" Mrs. Johnson glanced around the modest brick-tile house—clean but a far cry from their city home. "You chose to stay in this place?"

Children's laughter drifted through the window. Emily's lips curved unconsciously. "The air is fresh, and people are simple here."

Mrs. Johnson took a deep breath, suppressing her rising emotions. "How long?"

"Six years," Emily replied calmly. "I married the year after I came here."

Six years! The revelation struck Mrs. Johnson like a blow. She remembered her youngest son's suggestion to bring Emily back to the city—blocked by her eldest son's family. Her nails dug into her palms, but she felt no pain.

"The children?" Her voice turned hoarse.

"Playing inside." Emily stood. "I'll call them."

Watching her daughter walk away, Mrs. Johnson noticed her gait had changed. The once-delicate girl now moved with quiet confidence.

"David, Tommy, come meet Grandma."

Two rosy-cheeked children peeked shyly from the doorway. The elder, about five, and the younger around three, both wore neat new clothes, their faces round and healthy.

"Hello, Grandma!" they chorused.

Mrs. Johnson's eyes welled up instantly. These children looked better cared for than her city grandchildren—plump and bright-eyed, clearly untouched by hardship.

"Good children. What are your names?"

"I'm David!"
"I'm Tommy!"

When Mrs. Johnson reached to pat their heads, they instinctively ducked behind their mother. That small movement pierced her heart like a needle.

"Where's their father?" She forced her tone to remain even.

"Out on business." Emily's answer was light, but her eyes flickered.

Mrs. Johnson caught the hesitation. Suddenly, she realized how much of her daughter's life remained unknown to her. What had Emily endured these six years? How had she raised two such healthy children alone?

Small clothes fluttered on the clothesline outside. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting dappled patterns on the floor. Studying her daughter's serene profile, Mrs. Johnson truly understood for the first time—the girl who once depended on her had become a capable mother.

And she had missed it all.
###Chapter 204: The First Clash Between Mothers-in-law

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the café as Mrs. Lin took a graceful sip of her black tea. She had deliberately chosen a Chanel suit for the occasion, her pearl earrings gleaming softly in the light.

"Excuse me, are you Mrs. Gu?"

A slightly nervous voice came from behind. Mrs. Lin turned to see a middle-aged woman in a plain cheongsam standing by the table, clutching a counterfeit Gucci handbag tightly.

"That would be me." Mrs. Lin gave a slight nod, her gaze sweeping over the other woman with subtle scrutiny.

Mrs. Gu sat down awkwardly, her fingers twisting together anxiously. "Our son has caused you trouble."

"Not at all." Mrs. Lin smiled faintly and pushed the menu toward her. "What would you like to drink?"

"J-just water is fine."

When the server brought two glasses of water, Mrs. Gu immediately gulped down a large mouthful, droplets trickling down her chin. Mrs. Lin frowned imperceptibly and handed her a napkin.

"I heard your daughter is pregnant?" Mrs. Lin cut straight to the point.

Mrs. Gu choked violently, coughing hard enough to draw glances from nearby patrons.

"Th-this…" Mrs. Gu's face flushed red. "The two of them truly love each other…"

Mrs. Lin stirred the sugar cube in her tea with deliberate slowness. "Getting pregnant at twenty seems rather early, don’t you think?"

"We’ll take responsibility!" Mrs. Gu suddenly raised her voice. "Dowry, house, car—we won’t skimp on anything!"

The café fell silent. Mrs. Lin’s fingers paused on the rim of her cup.

"Mrs. Gu," she said, her voice as light as if discussing the weather, "do you really think my daughter can be bought with money?"

Mrs. Gu’s face paled. She fumbled through her bag and pulled out a bulging red envelope. "This—this is just a small token of our sincerity…"

The envelope landed with a thud on the table, revealing a thick wad of cash inside.

Mrs. Lin’s expression turned icy. She rose slowly, looking down at the flustered woman across from her.

"It seems we have nothing more to discuss."

She turned to leave, but Mrs. Gu grabbed her sleeve in desperation.

"Please!" Mrs. Gu’s voice trembled with tears. "My son truly loves your daughter…"

Mrs. Lin glanced down at the wrinkled handprint on her sleeve, her eyes unreadable.

Just then, the café door burst open. Two young people rushed in, panting—

"Mom!"
"Auntie!"

Both mothers turned to see their children’s panicked faces.


"Mary, I heard a lady from the city visited Emily's house?" Aunt Wang from next door whispered conspiratorially. "She was dressed so elegantly, carrying a briefcase!"

Mary Stone's broom clattered to the ground. Her heart skipped a beat—had Emily's family finally come?

For years, Emily had been receiving packages from the city every month. Mary had always wondered about it, but now that the moment had arrived, she felt unexpectedly flustered.

"I should go see for myself." Mary dusted off her apron and hurried toward Emily's house.

The courtyard gate was slightly ajar. Taking a deep breath, Mary knocked lightly.

"Mary, the door's unlocked. Please come in."

As she stepped inside, Mary immediately noticed the refined woman sitting in the parlor. The resemblance between her and Emily was uncanny—they could have been carved from the same mold.

"Emily, who is this?" Margaret Johnson set down her teacup, her sharp gaze sweeping over Mary. A pang of bitterness twisted in her chest—her daughter called this woman "Mary," yet hadn't addressed her as "Mom" even once.

"This is my mother-in-law," Emily turned to Mary. "Mary, this is my mother."

"Mrs. Johnson! What a pleasure!" Mary greeted warmly, though her heart pounded nervously. Why did this woman's eyes feel like they could cut through steel?

Margaret forced a tight smile. "Hello."

The air turned icy.

Mary understood immediately—city folk looking down on country folk. The disdain was practically tangible.

"Mary, please sit." Emily offered a stool before turning to Mary. "Since Mom's visiting, I'll go prepare some meat—"

"No need for trouble," Mary waved her hands quickly. "I'll fetch some from home. We just butchered a pig."

She subtly motioned to David. "Sweetheart, come with Grandma to get the meat."

Once they left, the silence in the room became deafening.

"Is David in school?" Margaret finally broke the quiet.

"There's no kindergarten in the countryside," Emily replied calmly.

"Mommy teaches us!" Tommy suddenly piped up, his little face beaming with pride.

Margaret's eyebrows shot up. "Oh? What does Mommy teach you?"

"I can recite The Hundred Family Surnames!" Tommy puffed out his chest and began chanting in his childish voice, "Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang..."

Margaret listened, growing more astonished by the second. The boy's pronunciation was flawless—nothing like a rural child's. Since when had her daughter become such a skilled teacher?

She studied Emily discreetly. Six years had changed her youngest daughter beyond recognition. The spoiled, willful girl was gone, replaced by a composed and dignified woman.

"Mommy, I forgot the rest..." Tommy scratched his head, looking to his brother for help.

Margaret's heart churned. Her daughter had poured everything into these children, yet refused to even take the college entrance exam. Was she truly determined to stay in this village? Six years—surely any resentment should have faded by now.

Gazing at Emily's serene profile, Margaret suddenly felt like she was looking at a stranger.
###Chapter 205: Investigating the Supporting Female Lead's Mysterious Origins

Sunlight streamed through the latticed windows, casting dappled patterns on the slate floor. I took a sip of tea, savoring the lingering fragrance on my tongue.

"Miss, about that lady you asked me to look into..." My maid, Spring Peach, lowered her voice and glanced around cautiously.

Setting down the teacup, I tapped my fingers lightly on the table. "Go on."

"That Miss Su's family background is rather... peculiar." Spring Peach leaned closer. "They say her father suddenly came into wealth overnight and bought a mansion in the southern district."

I frowned. "Did you trace the source of the money?"

She shook her head. "That's the strange part. The neighbors all say Mr. Su was once a destitute scholar who could barely afford meals. But right after that fire fifteen years ago..."

"Fire?" My pulse quickened.

"Yes, the tragic blaze that wiped out the Liu family in the western district." Spring Peach's voice dropped to a whisper. "Oddly enough, the Su family's fortunes changed just days after that incident."

The teacup grew warm in my hands. Squinting, I watched a crow flutter past the window, its shadow fleeting across the eaves.

"Dig deeper," I said, placing the cup down with a crisp clink. "Especially about that fire... and its connection to the Su family."

Before Spring Peach could respond, hurried footsteps echoed from the courtyard. We fell silent as the steward rushed in. "Miss, the Su family has sent an invitation—they request your presence at their flower viewing tomorrow."

My lips curled into a cold smile as I studied the gilded card. Perfect timing.

"Prepare a gift," I said, tossing the invitation onto the table. "Tomorrow, I'll see for myself what secrets Miss Su is hiding."

Outside, dusk deepened. The last rays of sunlight vanished beyond the horizon, as if heralding the emergence of long-buried truths.

"You're amazing, Tommy!" Emily Johnson gently ruffled her son's soft hair. "Next time, Mommy will practice counting with you."

Tommy's eyes sparkled, his cheeks flushed with excitement. "Yes! I'll count for Grandma!"

Before Mrs. Johnson could respond, the little boy eagerly began reciting numbers. His clear childlike voice filled the room as he flawlessly counted from one to eighty.

"How old is Tommy?" Mrs. Johnson asked in surprise.

"Three and a half!" Tommy puffed out his small chest proudly.

Mrs. Johnson silently compared him to her eldest grandson, who was already in elementary school but couldn't count as smoothly.

"Grandma, I can recite poems too!" Tommy preened like a little peacock showing off his feathers. "And I can write my name!"

Emily watched her son's eager display with mixed amusement. The child was clearly trying to impress his grandmother on their first meeting.

"Mom, how are Richard and Anthony?" Emily changed the subject.

Mrs. Johnson's expression darkened. "Your brother Anthony... became a live-in son-in-law."

A live-in son-in-law? Emily's heart skipped a beat. In this era, any self-respecting man would avoid such an arrangement. The original novel had barely mentioned the female lead's family background. Who had sent that mysterious telegram?

"How sudden..." Emily feigned surprise. "You never mentioned it in your letters."

Mrs. Johnson sighed. How could she admit such shame? Her second son had chosen to marry into another family to avoid being sent to the countryside. For months afterward, she and her husband couldn't hold their heads up in public.

"Your sister-in-law Victoria has two sons, and Catherine has two daughters and a son—the youngest is just a few months old," Mrs. Johnson said, her expression softening as she spoke of her grandchildren.

Three nephews, two nieces... Emily calculated silently. Catherine must have been desperate for a son.

"What does Anthony do now?"

"He used to work as a waiter at the state-run restaurant. Now he's learning to cook as his father-in-law's assistant."

An assistant cook? Emily raised an eyebrow. It was a step up from waiting tables, but far from being a head chef.

"Anthony became a cook?" She pretended to be shocked. "What about our sister?"

"Your sister sent some things for you." Mrs. Johnson's expression turned complicated.

The original novel had only one line about this sister: "Still immature after years in the countryside." Clearly, their relationship wasn't close.

"Does Anthony live with you?"

"No, he lives with his in-laws." Mrs. Johnson's tone carried clear disapproval.

Emily wondered silently. Could that telegram have been sent by Anthony?

"Richard got promoted, right?" she probed.

Mrs. Johnson finally smiled. "Your brother is now a workshop team leader."

A workshop team leader... Emily suddenly recalled the original plot. Shortly after the female lead's death, her eldest brother had been promoted to workshop manager. Now that she hadn't returned to the city, would that storyline change?

"Did anyone in the family take the college entrance exams after they were reinstated?"

Mrs. Johnson shook her head with a sigh. "Your sister is an elementary school teacher—she had the best chance, but she was pregnant and didn't take them. She's since given your brother-in-law two sons and a daughter."

As Emily listened, a chill ran down her spine. In the original story, after the female lead's death, all her siblings had thrived. Could there be some hidden connection?
###Chapter 206: The Supporting Role's Fate

"Why..." Su Wanqing slumped to the floor, her nails digging deep into her palms. "Why does it have to be me?"

She lifted her gaze to the mirror, staring at her flawless reflection. Her makeup was still impeccable, the teardrop mole at the corner of her eye shimmering under the light like a sinister jewel.

"System, is this what you called a happy ending?" Her voice trembled.

A cold, mechanical tone echoed in her mind: [Host has completed all tasks and obtained the protagonist's halo. However, supporting characters must follow the original story's conclusion.]

Outside, festive firecrackers crackled in celebration. Today was the male lead and female lead's wedding—the entire city was rejoicing.

Su Wanqing suddenly laughed. Slowly, she rose to her feet and walked to the vanity, picking up the ruby-encrusted hairpin.

"I refuse to accept this fate."

With a swift motion, she plunged the hairpin into her chest. Crimson blood instantly stained her pristine white qipao.

[Warning! Host's actions violate system regulations!]

"To hell with your rules." Blood trickled from the corner of Su Wanqing's lips. "I'd rather die than play the doomed supporting role."

As her consciousness faded, she thought she heard the system blaring a shrill alarm.

"Next life..." She collapsed into the pool of blood, her vision dimming. "I'll be the protagonist of my own story..."

Beyond the window, the faint strains of a wedding march drifted in. A single petal, carried by the wind, fluttered through the window and settled on her eyelid—like a tear that would never dry.

"Emily, all these years you haven't returned to the city... do you still resent us?" Margaret Johnson's voice trembled with emotion.

Emily lowered her gaze. In her memories, the argument before being sent to the countryside remained vivid. She suddenly realized that the turning point in her fate might have been hidden in that abrupt "voluntary registration."

"Mom, I didn't volunteer to go," she said softly.

Margaret's head snapped up. "What?"

"Someone signed me up." Emily tapped the table lightly with her fingertips. "Think about it—who benefited after I left?"

Margaret's face paled. After her eldest grandson was born, the family had struggled financially. Shortly after her youngest daughter was sent away, her second son had been persuaded to become a live-in son-in-law.

"She pretended to be virtuous, but behind the scenes..." Emily left the sentence unfinished.

Footsteps approached from outside. David Stone came running in with a block of tofu. "Grandma, Grandpa says he's coming soon!"

Margaret forced a smile. "Good boy."

Once the children had left again, Margaret clenched the hem of her shirt. "Why didn't you say anything at the time?"

Emily gave a bitter smile. "Would it have made any difference? The quota was already set." She rolled up her sleeve, revealing faint scars on her arm. "When I first arrived, I didn't know how to work. These scars are reminders."

"No warm clothes in winter, fainting from heatstroke in the fields during summer. Not earning enough work points to eat, starving until I had to dig for wild vegetables." Her voice was barely audible. "Then one night, someone sneaked into the educated youth dormitory..."

Margaret began to tremble.

"I had no choice but to marry." Emily met her mother's gaze directly. "Because the door back to the city had already been locked from the outside."

The room fell into an eerie silence. Amid the aroma of meat cooking from the kitchen, Margaret's tears splashed onto her knees.

"Mom, tell me..." Emily asked quietly, "is the person who locked that door living well now?"

Margaret stood up abruptly. She remembered her daughter-in-law's unusual enthusiasm before Emily's departure, the rumors about the workshop director's impending retirement, and...

"Emily," Margaret said, her voice shaking. "Come home with me."


###Chapter 207: Metamorphosis of Growth

Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the curtains when it suddenly struck me—I was no longer that naive girl.

The mirror reflected faint lines at the corners of my eyes. The once-clear gaze now held an indescribable complexity.

"Miss, your father requests your presence in the study," the butler reminded softly outside the door.

I set down the comb, my fingers brushing against the faded bow hairclip on the vanity. A gift from him on my sixteenth birthday.

In the study, Father stood by the window with his back to me. His silhouette seemed more stooped than I remembered.

"Have you made your decision?" His voice was hoarse with exhaustion.

I tightened my grip on the documents—a marriage alliance agreement that would determine the fate of two families.

There was a time when I would have thrown a tantrum over such matters. Now, I simply nodded in quiet acceptance.

As I left the study, my phone vibrated. A message from him: "I heard you're getting engaged?"

I didn’t reply. Tucking the phone away, I suddenly recalled that day under the cherry blossoms when he smiled and promised to protect me forever.

So this is what growing up means.
Not that we change,
but that we learn
to bury our most precious things
with our own hands.

"I chose a handsome man, the son of a village official." Emily Johnson traced the rim of her teacup absently. "He promised I'd never work the fields—he'd handle all the chores, hunting, fishing, even earning money. For years, he's cherished me like a treasure."

Margaret Johnson's heart clenched.

Her beautiful daughter, alone in that unfamiliar countryside. Those idle troublemakers must have set their sights on such a pretty girl.

Emily had no protection. The care packages from home grew scarcer—her daughter-in-law kept complaining about raising two children, demanding financial support.

What other choice did her youngest have but marriage?

Margaret's eyes stung. She'd been blind to her daughter-in-law's manipulations. That woman's false virtue and the grandson she'd borne had skewed Margaret's judgment.

Emily observed her mother's guilt with detachment.

Too late.

The original Emily was already gone. Even if she'd survived, that tragic ending would still have been partly her family's doing.

"Without his protection, I'd probably look as old as you by now." Emily's tone was flat, as if recounting someone else's story.

Margaret felt her heart being shredded.

That rushed departure to the countryside—they hadn't even packed properly.

"Won't you come home with me?" Margaret couldn't hide her disdain for this rural son-in-law. Even knowing he'd protected Emily didn't warm her to him.

"No." Emily's refusal was absolute.

As for visiting the city? Maybe later. She'd avoid it during college entrance exams too.

Her family home was a den of wolves—she wasn't a fool.

Margaret's chest tightened.

"Your brothers adored you..."

"They did." Emily met her mother's gaze squarely. "But marriage shifted their priorities. Before I left, when my fiancé was scheming behind my back—do you think they didn't know? Choosing to turn a blind eye severed those sibling bonds."

This truth needed stating.

Could husbands really remain oblivious to their wives' schemes?

Weighing a lifelong partner against a sister they'd loved for years—any man would know which mattered more.

Margaret paled.

If her daughter-in-law had truly plotted, could her eldest son have been ignorant?

Even she, as a mother, couldn't believe that.

Knowing his sister was being betrayed yet doing nothing. And they'd blamed their second son...

Each breath hurt.

When had her children become like this?

Does growing up always mean changing hearts?

Emily watched coldly.

These were the original Emily's family debts—none of her concern.

They weren't blind. They simply refused to believe their own could betray family.
###Chapter 208: She's Not the Supporting Role

"Cut!"

The director's shout cut through the set.

Everyone froze.

Emily stood in front of the camera, her hand still extended in a pushing motion. She stared at the fallen actress playing the second female lead, her expression shifting from shock to confusion.

"Emily! What are you doing?" The director stormed over, his face red with anger. "The script called for a gentle push. Why did you knock her over?"

"I..." Emily's lips parted.

She had followed the script exactly.

"Director, I'm fine," said Olivia, the second lead, dusting off her skirt as she stood. "Maybe Emily got too into character."

Olivia flashed Emily a smile.

That smile sent a chill down Emily's spine.

"Ten-minute break!" The director waved impatiently. "Emily, pull yourself together!"

Emily retreated to the rest area, where her assistant hurried over with a water bottle.

"Emily, you look pale."

She took the bottle, her fingers icy.

She hadn't used any real force.

Yet Olivia had fallen as if shoved violently.

"Emily."

A deep voice spoke behind her.

She turned to meet the intense gaze of Michael, the award-winning lead actor.

"Michael..."

"You've been set up," he murmured. "Olivia faked the fall."

Emily's pupils contracted.

"She leaned back on purpose to make it look like you pushed her," Michael said, his eyes flicking toward Olivia. "Be careful. She's not what she seems."

Emily tightened her grip on the water bottle.

She suddenly remembered Olivia's words on the first day of filming:

"Emily, did you know? In this story, you're actually the supporting character."

At the time, she'd thought it was a joke.

Now...

"Places, everyone!" the assistant director called.

Emily took a deep breath.

She wasn't the supporting role.

Never had been.

"I'm doing just fine here and have no intention of going back." Emily Johnson set her teacup down gently, the porcelain clinking softly against the wooden table. "You're welcome to stay a few days if you'd like."

She wasn't the original Emily—this so-called "family home" meant nothing to her. Those very relatives had played no small part in the original Emily's tragic fate.

Doing fine?

Margaret Johnson glanced around the humble farmhouse—the peeling adobe walls, the rough-hewn table. How could her daughter claim to be happy in a place like this?

"Emily..." Margaret hesitated. How many of those back home truly wanted her daughter to return? She wasn't even sure herself.

What could they offer if Emily did come back? Buy her a job? Would the family even agree? Her eldest daughter-in-law would be the first to object. Maybe they should have the eldest son's family move out instead...

But what about here? Would that country son-in-law let her go? And the two grandchildren—leave them in the countryside? Unless Emily remarried and took them along...

Margaret rubbed her temples. This required serious discussion with her husband.

"Emily, think carefully," Margaret lowered her voice. "If you stay in the countryside, there's no going back. When David and Tommy start school, how can rural education compare to the city?"

"Not returning now doesn't mean I can't take them to the city for school later," Emily replied calmly.

"Without city residency permits, how?" Unless they bribed officials—but if they had that kind of money, why live rurally at all?

Emily considered explaining they could buy property to establish residency, but saw no point. Soon they'd be living separate lives, rarely meeting. As for financial support, she'd provide what the original Emily owed—if those sisters-in-law dared ask.

Margaret massaged her temples. Her daughter seemed determined to stay put.

In the kitchen, Mary Stone cooked while straining to hear the conversation. City folk spoke so softly, unlike country people's loud voices.

Was the mother-in-law here to persuade Emily to return? Mary's heart skipped a beat. Michael treated his wife so well, and they had two children—surely not...

She shook her head, dismissing the thought. If they disapproved, why keep sending money and ration coupons? This must just be a visit.

Meanwhile, David and Tommy raced toward the brigade headquarters with their basket of tofu.

"Grandpa! Grandpa!" The children's bright voices interrupted the meeting.

John Stone Sr. looked up to see his grandsons in new cotton-padded jackets and shoes, David carrying a basket.

"What brings you two here?"

"Grandpa, Grandma's here!"

John blinked. Grandma? Emily's family?
###Chapter 209: The Legendary Mother-in-Law Arrives

The morning sun had just begun to filter through the window when the sharp ring of the doorbell startled Lin Xiaoman awake.

"Who is it—this early?" Rubbing her eyes, she shuffled to the door.

Outside stood an elegant middle-aged woman, clutching a limited-edition Hermès bag, her scrutinizing gaze sweeping over Lin Xiaoman.

"So, you're Lin Xiaoman?" The woman tilted her chin slightly. "I'm Gu Beichen's mother."

Lin Xiaoman snapped to full alertness.

"G-Good morning, Mrs. Gu!" She hastily smoothed her sleep-mussed hair. "I didn’t expect—"

"Aren’t you going to invite me in?" Mrs. Gu arched a brow.

Lin Xiaoman quickly stepped aside. As Mrs. Gu passed, her eyes lingered for two seconds on the pair of men’s slippers by the entryway.

"Does Beichen come here often?" Mrs. Gu settled onto the sofa, cutting straight to the point.

Lin Xiaoman’s hands trembled as she offered tea. "Please, have some tea. Beichen... visits occasionally."

Mrs. Gu took a delicate sip before sliding a check across the table.

"Five million. Leave my son."

Lin Xiaoman’s eyes widened. Was this some cliché drama trope?

"Mrs. Gu, Beichen and I truly—"

"Truly?" Mrs. Gu scoffed. "Do you have any idea how much the Gu Group is worth? How many socialites are lining up to marry into our family?"

Lin Xiaoman drew a deep breath, ready to retort, when the lock clicked.

"Xiaoman, I brought your favorite—" Gu Beichen froze in the doorway, breakfast in hand.

Three pairs of eyes locked in stunned silence.

Five seconds ticked by.

"Mother?" Beichen’s face paled. "What are you doing here?"

Mrs. Gu rose gracefully. "Just meeting the girl my son is so taken with." She cast a meaningful glance at the check. "Seems you two have some talking to do."

With that, she picked up her bag and strode to the door. As she passed Beichen, she murmured something that drained all color from his face.

The moment the door shut, Lin Xiaoman collapsed onto the sofa.

"Beichen, your mother—"

He pulled her into a tight embrace. "Don’t worry. I’m here."

But the tremor in his voice betrayed him.

Lin Xiaoman suddenly understood—that check wasn’t just about money. Something far more shocking lay beneath its surface.

"Your grandmother from the city is here?" The village cadres stared at David and Tommy in surprise.

They'd never met any of Emily's relatives. When Emily got married years ago, none of her family had attended. Why would they show up now?

This was highly unusual.

"Captain Stone, you should go check on this," someone suggested.

John Stone Sr. felt uneasy. Michael was away again, leaving only Emily with the two children. Though no one dared cause trouble after the Peter Wilson incident, who knew what might happen with this sudden city visitor?

He knew what Michael had done secretly - breaking into Peter's house with threats: "Lay one finger on my wife, and I'll break your son's leg." Emily certainly didn't know about that.

"When did Grandma arrive?" John asked as they walked.

Tommy tilted his head. "Right after breakfast. Mama had just finished teaching us writing."

So she'd come this morning, meaning she must have stayed overnight at the town guesthouse.

"Is Grandma home?"

"She's cooking."

John didn't press further. He couldn't tell the boys their grandmother might be here to take their mother back to the city.

Recently Emily had made noises about returning to the city before Michael stopped her. She'd been quiet since - was that all an act?

As the gate opened, Tommy dashed inside. "Mama, we're back!"

"Grandma..." David hurried toward the kitchen with the tofu basket.

John immediately spotted the city woman in the main room. Her features resembled Emily's, but she looked much younger than his wife.

City folks were different.

"Hello, Mrs. Johnson," he greeted.

Margaret Johnson nodded coolly. "Hello." Her tone placed galaxies between them.

John's heart sank.

"This is the children's grandfather," Emily interjected smoothly.

"David, Tommy, keep Grandma company. I'll help with cooking." She moved toward the kitchen.

John suppressed a scoff. Decades of "all men are equal" slogans, yet city people still carried this superiority. Ironically, villagers ate it up, treating urbanites like royalty - unaware how desperately city dwellers coveted rural produce.
###Chapter 210: What Does She Lack Now

"Miss, your package has arrived." Spring Peach hurried into the inner chamber, carrying a sandalwood box.

I set down the ledger I was reviewing and glanced up. The box was polished to a deep black sheen, its corners adorned with gilded copper fittings—clearly an expensive item.

"How many is this now?" I asked absently.

"Miss, this is the seventh one this month," Spring Peach answered cautiously. "All sent from the capital."

I let out a soft hum, running my fingertips over the lid. Ever since that incident, gifts from the capital had arrived like snowflakes in winter—silks, jewels, rare treasures... nothing was spared.

"Open it," I said flatly.

Spring Peach obeyed, lifting the lid. Inside lay a pair of mutton-fat white jade bracelets, their surfaces glowing softly in the candlelight.

"Fine jade," I remarked, picking one up and holding it to the light. "Pity..."

"Does Miss not like them?" Spring Peach ventured.

I set the bracelet down, my lips curling into a cold smile. "Like them? I stopped caring for such things long ago."

A commotion rose from outside the window. I walked over and saw several ornate carriages parked at the estate gates, their liveried servants carrying in yet more boxes.

"Who sent these?" I asked.

"The Li family, Miss," Spring Peach replied. "They say it's an apology."

I scoffed. "An apology? Now they remember their manners?"

Spring Peach stayed silent, head bowed.

Turning away, I went to the vanity and pulled open the bottom drawer. Inside lay neat stacks of banknotes, each stamped with the seals of the capital's most prominent financial houses.

"Miss..." Spring Peach hesitated.

"What?" I didn't look up.

"Do you... truly not intend to forgive them?"

My hands stilled. I turned to face her. "Forgive them?" A humorless laugh escaped me. "Have you forgotten how they treated me?"

Spring Peach lowered her gaze. "This servant hasn't forgotten."

I shut the drawer and walked back to the window. The setting sun cast a golden glow over the courtyard, gilding the mountains of gifts piled there.

"All these things..." I murmured. "What use are they?"

Spring Peach looked at me, confused.

I turned toward the inner chamber, leaving only these words behind: "Tell the gatekeeper—starting tomorrow, no more gifts are to be accepted."

"But... what about those already delivered?"

I paused mid-step, not turning around. "Donate them all to the orphanage outside the city."

Spring Peach's eyes widened. "Miss! Those are all—"

"I lack nothing they can give," I cut her off, my voice barely audible. "What I want... they can never return to me."

With that, I stepped into the inner chamber, leaving Spring Peach standing alone amidst a room full of treasures, utterly bewildered.

The situation was bitterly ironic.

Emily Johnson saw things clearly—whether from the countryside or the city, people bled the same red. Born under the same flag, raised in the same era, who was truly better than whom?

"Alright."

She turned toward the kitchen, and the air in the main room instantly stiffened.

John Stone Sr. cleared his throat, forcing conversation. "Mother-in-law, with the New Year coming, your factory must be busy?"

Margaret Johnson sipped her tea, expression cool. "Indeed. Henry meant to come, but his schedule wouldn't allow."

Her words were polished, but John saw through them. City folks and their favoritism toward sons—he'd seen it all before. During the educated youth return wave years back, which family hadn't pulled strings to get their boys home first?

"The village is slaughtering the New Year's pig soon. Since you're here, why not stay a few extra days?"

Margaret tapped her cup lightly. This visit was already an exception—she couldn't linger. The thought of her daughter marrying and having children without even informing the family still rankled.

"The factory only approved three days' leave."

Their exchange was a careful dance. John was probing—would this city mother-in-law take his daughter-in-law away?

The kitchen steamed with activity.

"Emily, how long is your mother staying?" Mary Stone whispered.

Emily chopped vegetables briskly. She'd already decided—she wasn't going back. Once her mother hit enough resistance, she'd leave. As for those relatives waiting to gloat...

Did she even need their pity packages now?

"Maybe tomorrow."

"So soon?" Mary fretted. "Your family's sent so much over the years. I've dried vegetables, cured meat..."

Cured meat? Emily nearly scoffed. She wouldn't waste good food on those ungrateful snakes.

"I don't have any stored. Take more dried vegetables, Mother."

Mary nodded eagerly. "Bamboo shoots, mushrooms—perfect for stewed chicken."

Consider it alms for beggars. Emily glimpsed the patches on Mary's sleeves, then recalled the disdain in Margaret's eyes earlier. Such relatives only deserved token visits during holidays.

She flipped the spatula, oil sizzling. Now she had skills—a trip to the county's black market earned her dozens. Watches weren't sustainable, but hairpins and ribbons still turned solid profits.

Who still cared for those condescending care packages?
###Chapter 211: Not Even This Last Decency?

"Miss Gu, you can't go in there!" The secretary frantically blocked the door.

Gu Wanqing let out a cold laugh, her high heels clicking sharply against the floor. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, revealing her flawlessly made-up face.

"Move."

A single word, light as a feather, yet it sent a shiver down the secretary's spine.

The office door was flung open.

Lu Chenchuan was bent over, fastening a necklace around the woman beside him, his long fingers lingering against her pale neck. He didn't even glance up at the disturbance.

"I said no interruptions."

Gu Wanqing stood frozen in the doorway, her nails digging into her palms. She stared at the man who had once sworn to love only her, now tenderly adjusting another woman's collar.

"Quite the scene, President Lu," she said, her lips curling into a bitter smile. "Seems I picked the wrong time."

Only then did Lu Chenchuan look up, his gaze as cold as if she were a stranger.

"What do you want?"

Gu Wanqing flung a stack of documents from her bag, the papers scattering across the floor.

"Divorce papers. Sign them."

The office fell dead silent.

The other woman discreetly stepped aside, though the smug tilt of her lips was unmistakable.

Lu Chenchuan rose slowly, his black suit accentuating his imposing figure. He stepped forward, his polished shoes leaving crisp imprints on the scattered documents.

"All this for that?"

Gu Wanqing lifted her chin, her eyes red but stubbornly dry.

"Three years of marriage, and you won't even give me this last shred of dignity?"

Lu Chenchuan suddenly laughed. He gripped her chin, his fingers pressing hard enough to make her wince.

"Dignity?" He leaned in, his voice a low, venomous whisper. "Gu Wanqing, do you deserve it?"

Outside, the secretary's coffee cup shattered on the floor.

"Mom, please have a seat." Emily Johnson wiped the stool carefully before helping her mother, Margaret Johnson, sit down.

In the kitchen, Mary Stone was busy preparing the meal. The rich aroma of cured meat filled the air. She had cooked a pot of plain white rice, without mixing in any sweet potatoes.

"Let's eat, dear," Mary said warmly as she brought the dishes to the table, her face beaming with hospitality.

Margaret eyed the cured meat and sausages on the table, her brow slightly furrowed. Weren't rural areas supposed to be so poor that people struggled to eat? Yet this cured meat looked even more glistening than what was sold at the Supply & Market in the city.

"Go wash your hands," Emily called to the two children.

David and Tommy obediently ran to the kitchen, the sound of running water soon following.

The dining table was quiet, save for the clinking of chopsticks against bowls. John Stone Sr. finished his meal quickly and stood up. "I'll head back first. The team needs to slaughter the New Year's pig."

With his departure, only the three women and two children remained in the house.

"Mom, would you like to rest for a while?" Emily asked softly.

Margaret surveyed the simple dwelling, her gaze settling on David and Tommy. The two boys were engrossed in their books, a sight that reminded her of her own grandson, who was always running around wildly.

"Take me for a walk outside," Margaret suddenly said.

Emily pressed her lips together. She knew stepping outside would attract attention, but seeing her mother's polished leather shoes, she nodded.

"David, Tommy, come with us."

The moment they stepped out, a villager approached. "Emily, is this your mother?"

Margaret frowned, struggling to understand the thick rural accent.

"Yes, my mother is visiting," Emily replied, shielding her mother slightly.

As they walked away, the village gossips quickly huddled together.

"Emily's mother dresses so elegantly—clearly a city woman."

"Do you think she's here to take her back to the city?"

"What about the two boys? Michael will have to remarry for sure."

"Remarry? What decent girl would want to be a stepmother?"

"Enough dowry could change that. Michael lives in a brick-tile house now!"

The whispers drifted on the wind as Emily tightened her grip on the children's hands. She knew the moment her mother entered the village, their peaceful life would be disrupted.
###Chapter 212: The Bait

"This job starts at fifty thousand a month."

Mrs. Lin slid the gilded business card across the coffee table, tapping it lightly with her manicured finger. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, making the embossed letters gleam.

Lin Yue sat opposite, her fingers twisting the hem of her shirt unconsciously. Her throat tightened as she stared at the card.

"Mom, what is this...?"

"Executive assistant to the CEO of Grandeur Group." Mrs. Lin took a sip of tea, the liquid shimmering in her porcelain cup. "You can start next Monday."

The afternoon light caught the diamonds in her earlobes as she tilted her head. She had styled her hair differently today, her makeup flawless.

"But my current job—"

"That pittance?" Mrs. Lin's red lips curled. "You can't even afford a decent handbag with what you earn."

Lin Yue bit her lower lip. True, her salary barely covered essentials, but at least she'd earned it herself.

"Take this job," her mother set the cup down with a clink, "and leave that penniless boy behind."

The air conditioning hummed, stirring the silk of Mrs. Lin's dress as she crossed her legs, waiting.

Lin Yue's grip tightened. She knew exactly who her mother meant—Chen Mo, her boyfriend of three years.

"Mom, Chen and I are serious—"

"Serious?" Mrs. Lin leaned forward, her perfume overwhelming. "He can't even afford a down payment on an apartment. What future can he give you?"

A vibration interrupted them. Lin Yue glimpsed Chen Mo's name flashing on her phone screen.

Mrs. Lin saw it too. With a cold smile, she pressed the reject call button, her crimson nails clicking against the glass.

"The choice is yours." She stood, lifting her limited-edition Hermès bag. "Either accept this opportunity, or keep struggling in your little fantasy."

Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she walked to the door. Then she paused without turning.

"Oh, Mr. Wang's birthday gala is next Friday." Her voice was casual. "His son just returned from studying in England."

The door closed softly, but the sound hit Lin Yue like a hammer. Tears welled in her eyes as she stared at the business card.

Her phone buzzed again—a text this time:
"Yue, I got promoted! Celebrate tonight?"

Her finger hovered over the screen as clouds swallowed the sunlight outside, plunging the room into shadow.

Sunlight streamed through the window as Emily Johnson washed the dishes. Her slender fingers traced the rough edges of the clay bowls, her fingertips calloused from years of labor.

"Emily..." Mrs. Johnson stood at the doorway, hesitating.

Without looking up, Emily said, "Mom, are you bringing up the city again?"

Outside, the laughter of children echoed against the adobe walls. David and Tommy were playing hide-and-seek with the village kids, their joyful shouts filling the yard.

Mrs. Johnson sighed, her gaze sweeping over the humble dwelling. "Look at this place. Not a single decent piece of furniture. You grew up with every comfort, and now you live like this..."

"I'm happy here," Emily interrupted, her voice calm but firm.

Her mother lowered her voice. "If you agree to return to the city, I can give you my job at the textile factory."

Emily's hands stilled.

"It's a permanent position—steady wages, year-end bonuses," Mrs. Johnson pressed. "A hundred times better than farming in this backwater!"

Emily lifted her eyes to meet her mother's. "What about Michael and the boys?"

"You can settle in first, then bring them later—"

"No." Emily's refusal was absolute. "We go together, or not at all."

Mrs. Johnson's face darkened. "Have you lost your mind? City residency is priceless! How will you register a country man and two children?"

"Then we're done talking." Emily turned to leave.

"Wait!" Her mother grabbed her arm. "I'm thinking of your future! Do you know how many people would kill for this chance?"

Emily pulled free. "I know. But I also know I wouldn't be alive today without Michael."

Mrs. Johnson froze.

"That winter I had a high fever—he carried me twenty miles through the mountains to the hospital," Emily's voice wavered. "To nurse me back to health, he hunted in a blizzard and nearly fell off a cliff."

Outside, Michael Stone returned with firewood on his shoulders. His tall frame cast a long shadow in the sunlight, sweat glistening on his sun-bronzed face.

Emily's expression softened. "Mom, all you see is a rundown house. What you don't see is the man who truly loves me."

Mrs. Johnson opened her mouth but found no words.

"Keep your job," Emily said gently. "Someone else needs it more than I do."

A sudden cry came from the yard. Michael rushed over—Tommy had tripped. He scooped the boy up, carefully brushing dirt from his pants.

Watching them, Mrs. Johnson's eyes filled with conflict.

"Mom, if you really want what's best for me," Emily said finally, "then bless us."

The setting sun stretched their three shadows long across the ground. Standing in the doorway, Mrs. Johnson wondered—for the first time—if her daughter's choice might be right after all.
###Chapter 213: The Unapproved Future Son-in-Law

"Mom, please don't be like this." Emily's grip on her phone turned her knuckles white.

Her mother's shrill voice crackled through the receiver: "I've done my research! That Johnson boy is nothing but a spoiled playboy! No real job, just wasting his days away!"

The setting sun painted the living room in shades of orange through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Emily bit her lower lip, her gaze drifting to the gilded invitation on the coffee table.

"Mom, you haven't even met him—"

"Meet him? Absolutely not!" Her mother's voice rose sharply. "Have you forgotten what his father did to our family?"

Emily's chest tightened. Of course she remembered. That business dispute a decade ago had nearly bankrupted the Johnsons.

"But that was in the past—"

The line went dead with a sharp click. Emily stared at the darkened screen, her fingertips turning cold.

The doorbell rang.

Taking a deep breath, she smoothed her expression before answering. Michael stood at the threshold, a bouquet of roses in hand.

"What's wrong?" His sharp eyes immediately caught her distress.

Emily forced a smile. "It's nothing. My mother...has some reservations about our engagement."

Michael's expression darkened as he set the flowers on the entryway table. His hand cupped her cheek. "Let me talk to her."

"Now isn't the right time—"

"It has to be now." His tone left no room for argument. "I won't let anyone—not even your mother—stand between us."

Emily looked up at him. The fading sunlight cast shadows across his chiseled profile, and the usual playful glint in his eyes had been replaced by startling intensity.

Suddenly, she recalled the anonymous text she'd received that morning: Do you really think he loves you? This is just his revenge.

"Michael," she whispered, "did you pursue me just for this arranged marriage?"

His hand froze mid-air.

"Michael never let me work in the fields. He supported all three of us by himself. I'm not ungrateful. If Grandpa can arrange a job for him in the city, we'll move back and take care of you."

Mrs. Johnson eyed her daughter's new clothes—even the boys' outfits were spotless. Meanwhile, her own sleeves bore patches.

This country bumpkin son-in-law had clearly taken good care of them.

No wonder Emily refused to return with her.

Still, she couldn't stomach the thought of her daughter married to some backwater farmer she'd never met.

"Let me show you to your room."

Emily didn't bother arguing. She grabbed her mother's luggage and headed next door.

The room held a wooden bed, two camphor chests, and a desk neatly stacked with textbooks and pencils. The cement floor gleamed, the white walls pristine.

"This is Tommy and David's room."

Mrs. Johnson hid her surprise. These conditions surpassed many city homes—except for the lack of electricity.

"I brought you some things. Didn't know you'd married, so nothing for the boys."

She despised her son-in-law's origins but genuinely adored her grandsons. Both children were polite and well-mannered, nothing like country brats.

Take the gifts?

Of course.

"Your favorite apricot preserves, White Rabbit candies, and this cashmere sweater..."

Did she think Emily was a child? A few sweets couldn't make up for years of hardship.

She wasn't the original Emily—not so easily appeased.

"Thank you."

Free things were free things. Only a fool would refuse.

"Rest now. The train ride must've exhausted you. Didn't sleep well at the inn last night, did you?"

Mrs. Johnson was indeed weary. Age made travel grueling.

"Alright."

Emily closed the door softly and returned to her room. The boys slept soundly.

She dropped the gifts on the table, massaging her temples. Just months of peace, now shattered.

News spread through Stone Village like wildfire.

"Did you hear? Emily's mother came!"

"What'd she bring?"

Elizabeth Stone and Patricia Stone itched with curiosity but dared not visit. Everyone knew how formidable Emily had become.

Villagers buzzed:

"Will she take Emily back to the city?"

"Michael's away—who'll stop her?"

"What about the boys?"

Ethan Miller crouched outside the courtyard, wringing his hands.

Would she really leave?

Michael, hurry back!

Meanwhile, a hundred miles away, Michael Stone sneezed three times in succession.

"Michael, catching cold?"

Charles Clark's stomach dropped. His friend had once been strong as an ox—was this lingering damage from that injury?
###Chapter 214: Always Have a Backup Plan

Morning sunlight filtered through the gap in the curtains, and I rubbed my bleary eyes. The screen of my phone on the nightstand lit up with a bank balance alert.

The number was lower than I'd expected.

I sat up abruptly, the silk nightgown slipping off one shoulder. My fingers swiped across the screen, double-checking the alarming figure.

"How could this be...?" I murmured.

Birds chirped outside, but their cheerful song did nothing to lift the gloom in my heart. Last month's failed investment, combined with unexpected medical expenses, had nearly drained my savings.

My phone buzzed—a message from my best friend: "Don’t forget the charity gala this weekend, babe~"

I stared at the text, my finger hovering over the screen. A gala meant a dress, jewelry, and a donation—each one a significant expense.

Ding. Another message popped up.

"I heard the young heir of the Lin Group will be there. Didn’t you want to meet him?"

I bit my lower lip. It was an opportunity—but also a risk. The Chanel couture gown in my closet still had an outstanding balance, and three credit card bills were already piling up.

Absently tracing the edge of my phone, I glanced at the framed photo on my vanity. It was taken last year in the Maldives, my smile carefree and bright.

Now, every penny I’d spent back then felt like a ticking time bomb.

I took a deep breath and replied: "I’ve been busy lately. Might have to skip this one."

Setting the phone down, I walked barefoot to the window and yanked the curtains open. The sunlight stung my eyes, but I needed the harsh clarity.

It was time to reassess.

The untouched passbooks in my drawer might finally be of use. I ran my fingers over their smooth covers, feeling the weight of the paper.

In this world, having extra funds tucked away was always the best safety net.

As my mother used to say: "A woman can live without love, but never without financial security."

I picked up my phone and dialed a number I hadn’t called in a long time.

"Hello, Manager Zhang? About that investment plan you mentioned—I’d like to discuss the details again."

"Achoo—" Michael Stone suddenly sneezed.

"Third Brother, catching a cold?" Daniel River asked with concern.

Michael rubbed his nose. "Not a cold." He glanced up at the sky, his lips curling into an unconscious smile. "Maybe Emily's thinking about me."

"Of course she is!" Samuel Bright chimed in, grinning. "Mrs. Stone must be missing you."

Warmth spread through Michael's chest. But the thought of fieldwork after the New Year reminded him they needed to earn as much as possible now. If he passed next year's college entrance exam, he'd have to take Emily and the kids to the city for school—expenses everywhere.

"Be careful with this batch," Michael reminded them. "Don’t forget last time’s lesson."

His brothers nodded solemnly. Traveling between cities had exposed them to many novelties. Each time Michael spotted something nice, he wanted to buy it for Emily. But remembering her frugal nature, he held back.

"Better save more money," Michael mused. "Housing prices keep rising. Buying outright beats renting later."

Back in Stone Village, the two little ones clung to Emily the moment they woke.

"Mommy, will you leave with Grandma?" David blurted after much hesitation. Tommy stared at her with wide, anxious eyes.

Emily’s heart ached as she pulled them close. "Mommy’s not going anywhere. I’ll always stay with you."

Those village gossips were to blame, teasing the kids with "Your mom’s going back to the city with Grandma." Emily gritted her teeth. How could anyone joke like that?

"Come on, let’s see what’s for dinner." She took their hands and led them outside.

Margaret Johnson was sunbathing in the yard. Spotting them, she waved. "David, Tommy, come to Grandma."

Reassured, the boys scampered over, their usual energy returning.

"Mom, I’ll take you to the station tomorrow," Emily said.

Margaret nodded. "Good. I’ll discuss that matter with your father when I get back."

Just then, Mary Stone arrived carrying a large bundle.

"Dear in-law, brought you some mountain goods," Mary said warmly. "Home-dried vegetables, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots."

Margaret thanked her politely. Mary bustled into the kitchen. "Emily, let’s make some buns?"

"Sure, Mom." Emily rolled up her sleeves. "How about dumplings too? So my mother can try them."

Soon, the kitchen buzzed with activity. The aroma of flour mingled with laughter, filling the yard.
###Chapter 215: The Crossroads of Fate

"Is this really changing the plot?" Emily Johnson's fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the script.

The set lights were blinding. She stared at the newly revised script—Scene 37 was densely circled in red ink.

"Miss Johnson, the director wants to reshoot this scene," a production assistant said, jogging over with a new storyboard.

The makeup artist dabbed cool powder on her cheeks, but Emily felt feverish all over.

She distinctly remembered that in the original novel, the female lead was supposed to accept the second male lead's confession here. But in the revised script, the female lead turned and walked away.

"Why the change?" She stopped an assistant director passing by.

The assistant director smiled mysteriously. "The investors requested it. Said it needed more dramatic tension."

Emily's heart skipped a beat. This alteration would completely alter the trajectory of the entire story.

She pulled out her phone, her finger hovering over a familiar contact.

Should she inform the original author?

"Five minutes to filming!" The clapperboard operator's shout snapped her out of her thoughts.

In the distance, the male lead was deep in discussion with the director. Suddenly, he looked up and locked eyes with Emily.

His gaze held an indescribable complexity.

Emily took a deep breath. After this scene, the story would veer toward an entirely different ending.

And she stood at the crossroads of fate.

"This flour is incredibly fine," remarked Mary Stone as she kneaded the dough. Emily Johnson smiled faintly while wrapping dumplings. She had exchanged this premium flour from her PennyDeals system—far superior to the standard flour of this era.

The cozy kitchen was filled with the mingling aromas of two different dough dishes. John Stone Sr. followed the scent and brightened at the sight of the table laden with steamed buns and dumplings.

"Take whichever you like," Emily offered warmly.

Late into the night, Mary finally finished tidying the kitchen and left. Emily gently washed the children's faces and feet, her movements tender. Margaret Johnson hovered nearby, hesitating.

"Mom, is something wrong?" Emily looked up.

Margaret opened her mouth but only sighed. "Get some rest early."

In the darkness, David suddenly clutched Emily's sleeve. "Mom, can I go with you to town tomorrow?"

Emily's heart clenched. Was her son afraid she wouldn't return if she left with Grandma?

"Me too!" Tommy immediately chimed in.

"David can come. Next time for you, Tommy." Emily ruffled her younger son's hair. "I'll bring you something tasty."

Tommy's eyes welled up, but he stubbornly bit his lip to hold back tears.

"I promise I'll take you to town next time," Emily assured him.

At dawn, Mary arrived with pancakes and eggs. Her gaze flickered when she noticed Emily packing.

"Mom, could you watch Tommy for me?" Emily said. "I'm taking David to see Grandma off."

Mary relaxed slightly—bringing David meant she intended to return.

"Grandma, Mom said she'll take me next time!" Tommy declared, tilting his small face upward.

Emily tucked a wrapped piece of cured meat into the luggage. "One for Anthony."

Just as they were leaving, Tommy suddenly broke free from Mary and rushed over. "Come back soon, Mom!"

Emily bent down to kiss his cheek. "I will."

Hand in hand with David, she stepped out of the yard, her pulse quickening. Would this farewell become the turning point that altered everything?
###Chapter 216: Rather Die Than Let My Daughter Marry a Poor Boy

"Mom, what are you saying?" Emily's teacup slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor.

Mrs. Johnson cast a cold glance at the broken pieces. "Was I unclear? That country boy isn't good enough for you!"

The steady patter of rain outside made the tension in the room even heavier.

"But..." Emily's voice trembled. "He treats me well..."

"Well?" Mrs. Johnson slammed her hand on the table and stood abruptly. "What can he give you? A rundown shack? A life of scraping by in the dirt?"

Emily bit her lower lip, tears welling in her eyes.

"Your father only married me because I was young and beautiful. And look at me now!" She pointed at the faded family portrait on the wall. "Is this the life you want?"

In the photo, a younger Mrs. Johnson smiled brightly. Now, wrinkles lined the corners of her eyes.

"Mom, times have changed..."

"Enough!" Mrs. Johnson cut her off sharply. "I've already arranged for you to meet the mayor's son next week!"

Emily jerked her head up. "I won't go!"

"You don't have a choice!" Mrs. Johnson grabbed her daughter's wrist. "I'd rather die than let you marry that penniless boy!"

The rain grew heavier, drumming loudly against the windowpanes.

Emily wrenched her arm free and dashed into the downpour. Rain mixed with tears blurred her vision.

In the distance, a figure holding a black umbrella anxiously scanned the area.

It was the young man she had secretly arranged to meet.

Mrs. Johnson chased after her to the doorway, her face turning pale at the sight.

"Come back here!" she screamed, her voice breaking.

But Emily was already running toward the figure under the umbrella, never looking back.

Through the curtain of rain, the distance between mother and daughter grew.

One resolute.

The other despairing.

Mrs. Johnson glanced back at little Tommy with reluctance, forcing a smile. "When spring comes, Grandma will take you to the city for a visit."

The oxcart swayed along the country road as Mrs. Johnson frowned, suppressing her discomfort. She stole glances at the cheerful villagers chatting around her and swallowed her complaints.

"Emily, is this your family?" asked a kerchief-wearing woman warmly.

Emily Johnson nodded slightly. "My mother. She came to visit but has to return for work—the factory's busy at year-end."

Mrs. Johnson straightened her posture and replied in perfect Mandarin, "Thank you all for looking after Emily these years."

The women immediately grew flustered, elbowing each other to speak:

"Michael treats his wife well—Emily hasn't worked the fields since marrying him."

"He tends their private plot himself."

"Won't even let her wash clothes!"

The cart creaked to a stop at the town entrance. Emily hopped down effortlessly and lifted David out.

"Mom, let's wait over there." She pointed to the bus stop.

Mrs. Johnson hurried after her, whispering, "Emily, you're smart enough to pass the entrance exams. Vocational school or college—either would get you a job assignment." She glanced at David trailing behind and gritted her teeth. "Don't throw your life away for some country man."

"Michael said he'd support me if I study," Emily replied calmly.

Mrs. Johnson's heart sank. Support? More like surveillance! She'd learned enough during her stay—divorced men with two kids rarely remarried, especially with family planning rumors circulating...

David clutched his mother's hand tightly, his little face tense. He understood Grandma didn't like Daddy and wanted to take Mommy away.

"The bus is here!" Emily waved as a dusty coach wheezed to a stop. The conductor bellowed, "All aboard for the county town—"

Mrs. Johnson was jostled onto the bus, only to find Emily and David settling in the back row.

"Tell me if you feel carsick." Emily popped an orange candy into David's mouth. "Suck, don't chew."

The conductor counted heads. "Kids pay full fare!"

"Three tickets." Emily paid without hesitation, earning a second glance.

The bus lurched along, passengers disembarking at intervals. By the county stop, David had gone pale.

"Let's get your train ticket first." Emily steadied her mother. "You need to catch the connection to the provincial capital."
###Chapter 217 Farewell to Margaret

The first light of dawn crept over the courtyard, veiled in a thin mist.

I stood beneath the covered walkway, watching the maids bustle about with the luggage. Margaret waited in the yard, her plain dress fluttering slightly in the morning breeze.

"Must you go?" I asked softly.

She turned, weariness shadowing her features. "It's time."

My fingers tightened around the handkerchief in my hand—the one embroidered with the pattern she'd taught me. "When will you return?"

She shook her head, gaze drifting toward the distance. "I can't say."

A maid approached with a bundled parcel. "Miss, everything's packed."

Margaret took it, her fingers trembling slightly. I noticed the jade bracelet I'd given her last year still circling her wrist.

"Take care," she said, casting me one last glance before turning toward the gate.

I took two hurried steps after her before forcing myself to stop. In the morning light, her figure grew smaller until she disappeared around the corner.

A gust of wind carried away the last traces of her perfume.

"Miss..." Spring Peach called worriedly.

Only then did I realize I'd crumpled the handkerchief beyond recognition. The twin lotus flowers I'd stitched now seemed painfully ironic.

"Let's go inside," I heard myself say.

As I turned, a drop of moisture landed on my hand. Whether morning dew or something else, I couldn't tell.

The morning mist still lingered when Emily Johnson stood at the bus station with little David's hand in hers. She wore a light blue polyester blouse that made her fair skin glow like snow.

"Mom, are you sure you can't stay a few more days?" Emily asked softly, her fingers unconsciously fiddling with her hem.

Margaret Johnson shook her head, her silver-streaked hair catching the morning light. "There are matters to attend to in the city. I can't leave your father alone for too long."

By the time the rickety bus arrived at the county seat, the sun had climbed above the treetops. Emily supported her mother with one hand and held David with the other as they navigated the bustling streets.

"The post office is right ahead!" David announced, his eyes sparkling as he looked up.

A long queue snaked outside the post office. Emily settled Margaret on a bench before taking David into the crowd.

"Excuse me," Emily leaned toward the ticket window, her voice gentle, "My mother has difficulty walking. Could we possibly get a sleeper ticket?"

The round-faced clerk studied her for a moment. Emily quickly produced her educated youth certificate and prompted David to say, "Hello, sister!"

"Sleeper tickets are hard to come by..." the clerk hesitated.

"I know. Please help us." Emily discreetly slid twenty-five dollars across the counter.

When the thin paper ticket finally changed hands, Margaret's eyes grew moist. "It's been years since I've traveled in a sleeper..."

They had lunch at the state-run restaurant. Margaret insisted on paying, ordering braised pork and stir-fried greens. David ate with gusto, sauce smeared around his mouth, but Emily barely touched her food.

"Mom, send a telegram when you arrive," she repeated.

The bus station teemed with people. Before boarding, Margaret suddenly turned and embraced her daughter. "Take care of yourself, Emily."

Dust swirled as the bus pulled away. Emily stood motionless until it disappeared around the bend.

"Mom, where are we going now?" David tugged her sleeve.

Emily took a deep breath and smiled. "Someplace fun."

The bookstore was so quiet you could hear pages turning. David pressed his face against the glass display like he'd discovered treasure.

"Mom, this one!" He excitedly held up a copy of How the Steel Was Tempered.

Emily chuckled and ruffled his hair. "That's quite a thick book. Do you think you can read it?"

"I'll use a dictionary!" David puffed out his chest.

The cashier gave them an appraising look as they checked out—few families could afford books for their children in those days.

Outside, their elongated shadows stretched in the sunset. Emily suddenly knelt to meet David's gaze. "I promise we'll come here every month to buy you books. How does that sound?"

The boy's face lit up as he nodded vigorously. Watching his innocent smile, Emily felt something soften deep inside her.
###Chapter 218: Luring Her Into the Trap

The night was ink-black, the starlight dim.

Sophia stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her slender fingers absently tracing the rim of her wine glass. The red liquid swirled gently, reflecting her slightly pale face.

"What's on your mind?"

A deep male voice, laced with lazy amusement, suddenly sounded behind her. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was—the ever-elusive second son of the Lu family, Lucian.

"Thinking of ways to shake off my shadow," she replied coolly, taking a sip of wine.

Lucian chuckled, stepping out of the shadows. He wore a dark gray suit that accentuated his tall frame, his tie loosely knotted, exuding an air of careless charm.

"How cruel," he murmured, tapping the edge of her glass with his fingertip. "I came all this way to bring you good news."

Sophia arched a brow. "What news could possibly be worth your personal visit?"

"The old man has relented," he whispered, his warm breath brushing her ear. "If you agree, you can walk out of this gilded cage tomorrow."

Her fingers tightened around the glass.

A faint crack sounded in her palm.

"Conditions?" Her voice was taut.

Lucian smirked, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Come with me."

A flash of lightning outside illuminated his sharp features. The usual mockery in his eyes was replaced by something unsettlingly sincere.

Her heart skipped a beat.

She knew it was a trap.

But compared to being the Lu family’s puppet, she’d rather step into this man’s snare.

"Fine," she said, downing the rest of her wine in one go, her red lips curling into a resolute smile. "But remember this, Lucian—"

"Who’s trapping whom remains to be seen."

Thunder roared overhead.

"Come, sweetheart. Mommy will take you to the department store to broaden your horizons."

No sooner had they stepped out of the bookstore than Emily Johnson took little David's hand and headed toward the department store. She didn't notice the greedy eyes watching her from the shadows.

"It's so tall!" David craned his neck in awe.

"It's three stories high," Emily explained gently. "In big cities, there are even taller buildings. You can take elevators up—very convenient."

She knelt to meet her son's gaze. "Our country's architectural technology is the best in the world."

"Mommy, how big is the world?" David blinked curiously.

"It's 510 million square kilometers, divided into five continents..." Emily patiently explained, unaware of the shocked expressions around her when she mentioned "the Earth is round."

The dazzling array of goods in the department store left David wide-eyed. The first floor had groceries, the second had clothing, and the third featured larger items like bicycles.

After their visit, Emily planned to take her son to a state-run diner for noodles. But just a few steps outside, a stranger suddenly grabbed her arm.

"Pervert!" Emily shouted loudly, secretly bracing herself to fight back.

"Let go of my mommy!" David released her hand and swung his tiny fists at the man.

"Chunhua, stop this nonsense!" The man feigned heartbreak. "I know you want to return to the city, but you can't just steal money from home and run off with our child!"

The bystanders, hearing this, hesitated, their expressions shifting to reluctant understanding.

Emily sneered and delivered a sharp kick between the man's legs.

"Ah—!" He doubled over in pain.

"This man is a trafficker!" Emily snapped. "If you don’t believe me, call the police!"

As she spoke, she kicked him again. Someone had already run off to report the incident.

Nearby, Jessica Miller found the bold woman oddly familiar. When she recognized Emily’s face, she quickened her pace toward them.

"Who do you think you're fooling?" Emily punctuated each kick with a scathing remark. "Scum like you destroy families!"

Her words silenced the onlookers who had considered intervening. She was right—how many families had traffickers torn apart? Such evil couldn’t be tolerated.

The man tried to flee but was swiftly surrounded by the furious crowd. Emily shielded David, watching coldly as the would-be kidnapper was cornered.
###Chapter 219: Poetic Justice

Slap!

The sharp sound of a palm striking flesh echoed through the silent hospital room.

Lin Xiaonuan flexed her stinging fingers, her cold gaze fixed on the once-arrogant man before her. Lu Mingyuan's cheek bloomed red, a thin trail of blood seeping from the corner of his lips.

"That was for my sister."

Her voice was soft, yet every word cut like a blade.

Lu Mingyuan struggled to prop himself up on the hospital bed, disbelief flashing in his eyes. His mouth opened, but no sound came out—the doctors had said his vocal cords were damaged, and he wouldn’t speak for at least three months.

"Surprised?" Xiaonuan smirked. "Did you think faking an illness would save you?"

Slowly, she pulled a stack of photos from her bag and laid them out one by one on the sheets. Each image showed Lu Mingyuan wrapped around a different woman, spanning three years of infidelity.

"And this is just the tip of the iceberg."

Lu Mingyuan’s pupils shrank. He lunged for the photos, but Xiaonuan seized his wrist and pressed down hard.

"Does it hurt?" She tightened her grip. "My sister felt a thousand times worse when she jumped."

Outside, lightning split the sky, illuminating Lu Mingyuan’s ashen face. He shook his head violently, a strangled rasp escaping his throat.

"Don’t rush," Xiaonuan said, releasing him to retrieve another document. "There’s more."

She unfolded it—a medical diagnosis.

"Stage four liver cancer. Six months left, at most." She read the verdict aloud, her lips curling into a cruel smile. "How… poetic."

Lu Mingyuan trembled violently before doubling over in a coughing fit. Blood splattered across the white sheets.

Xiaonuan took a graceful step back, smoothing her skirt.

"Enjoy what little time you have left." She turned toward the door, pausing just before she opened it. "Oh, one more thing—"

"Every asset under your name? They’re mine now."

The door clicked shut. A heavy thud sounded from inside the room.

In the hallway, Xiaonuan pulled out her phone and dialed.

"Hello, police? I’d like to report a case of financial fraud..."

A piercing scream cut through the bustling town.

Emily Johnson retracted her leg, her sharp gaze fixed on the middle-aged man writhing in pain on the ground. She had kicked him with full force, aiming straight for his most vulnerable spot.

"Mommy..." Little David clutched her sleeve, his face pale.

"Don't be afraid." Emily shielded her son behind her, scanning their surroundings warily. She had noticed the suspicious man tailing them for some time.

The man groaned, clutching his groin. "W-why did you attack me?"

"Why?" Emily scoffed. "Because you tried to kidnap my son!"

The crowd gasped, quickly gathering around them.

"I didn't!" The man's eyes darted nervously as he struggled to stand.

Emily pulled a stun gun from her pocket and flicked it on with a sharp click. "Care to test this?"

The man's face drained of color. He turned to flee.

"Stop him!" someone in the crowd shouted.

Several burly men tackled him to the ground. Soon, officers arrived at the scene.

"Ma'am, please come with us to give a statement," a young officer said, eyeing the stun gun with surprise.

Emily calmly put it away. "My husband brought it back from the military for protection."

At the station, the man continued to lie. "I was just asking for directions..."

"Directions? You followed us for three blocks!" Emily countered coldly. "And tried to lure my son with candy?"

Little David added timidly, "He said he'd take me to buy sweets... and that Mommy was waiting..."

The officers' expressions darkened. They were all too familiar with child abduction tactics.

"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll investigate thoroughly," an older officer assured her, patting her shoulder. "You and your son can go home and rest."

Outside the station, Emily's hands trembled slightly. She knelt and hugged David. "Were you scared?"

He shook his head, then nodded. "Mommy was so brave."

"Remember, if a stranger ever..."

"Don't take anything from them, and don't go with them!" David finished eagerly.

Emily kissed his forehead. "Smart boy. Let's go home."

On the way back, she remained tense. Only when she saw the familiar smoke rising from Stone Village did she finally relax.

"Mommy!" Little Tommy barreled toward her like a tiny cannonball, throwing himself into her arms. "You took so long!"

Mary Stone peeked out from the kitchen. "What happened? You look upset."

Emily gathered both children close. "Let's wait for Grandpa to come home before we talk."

As night fell, John Stone Sr. returned with his hoe. After hearing his daughter-in-law's story, he slammed the table. "Those damn traffickers!"

"Dad, I want to organize an anti-abduction workshop for the village," Emily proposed. "While everyone's home before the holidays..."

"Good idea!" John declared firmly. "I'll notify the whole village tomorrow!"

Later, Emily tucked the boys into bed, gently smoothing David's furrowed brow as he slept. She gazed at the moonlight outside, tightening her grip on the stun gun.

That night, one trafficker's arrest altered the fate of many families. Unbeknownst to Emily, her decision would soon save countless more children...
###Chapter 220: A Terrifying Moment

"Little girl, your mom is waiting for you up ahead."

A strange woman suddenly grabbed my hand, her smile so warm it sent chills down my spine. I instinctively tried to pull away, but her grip only tightened.

"Are you mistaken, ma'am?" I forced calm into my voice, though my eyes darted around nervously.

The mall buzzed with noise, yet no one noticed the disturbance in the corner. The woman's fingers dug into my skin, her nails nearly breaking flesh.

"Don't be difficult. Mommy will buy you a new dress," she whispered, her tone laced with threat.

My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. Spotting a uniformed guard nearby, I stomped hard on her foot.

"Help! I don't know her!"

My scream cut through the crowd. The woman's face twisted before she released me and bolted. By the time the guard arrived, she had vanished.

I collapsed to the floor, my back drenched in cold sweat. That was close—too close.

"Emily, stay for dinner," Mary Stone said as she sorted vegetables. Since the family had divided their property, neither Robert's nor William's family had been invited for meals. She had once thought her third daughter-in-law was too stubborn, but now she realized she'd misjudged her.

"Thank you, Mom." Emily rubbed her sore back. After a long day, she didn’t feel like cooking and had planned to make do with a simple meal. A hot dinner was more than welcome.

The sound of children’s laughter filled the house. David was animatedly telling Tommy about their trip to town, proudly showing off a new picture book. The two boys huddled together, completely absorbed.

The gate creaked open as John Stone Sr. returned, dust covering his clothes.

"Dad!" Emily hurried to meet him.

John brushed off the dirt. "What is it?"

"David and I were almost kidnapped today," Emily said bluntly.

"What?!" His pipe clattered to the ground.

Emily quickly recounted the day’s events. Her voice trembled when she reached the most harrowing part. "Dad, with the New Year approaching, kidnappers will be more active. Shouldn’t the brigade organize an anti-abduction campaign?"

She paused, her tone grave. "Today it was just one person, but if it had been a group..." She left the rest unsaid, but the implication was clear.

John’s face darkened. Emily wasn’t one to exaggerate—this was likely true. The thought of nearly losing his grandson sent a chill down his spine.

"Prepare a list of key points. I’ll call a meeting with the brigade leaders tomorrow."

After dinner, Emily walked home with the boys. Tommy clung tightly to her sleeve, and even David was more clingy than usual. Both insisted on sleeping with her that night, and she didn’t refuse.

"It’s okay, Mommy’s here," she murmured, patting their backs and humming a lullaby. Once their breathing steadied, she lay awake for hours.

The anti-abduction campaign needed to be straightforward but impactful—otherwise, the villagers wouldn’t take it seriously.

The next morning, Emily sat down to draft the guidelines. When she finished, she quizzed the boys.

"Do you take candy from strangers?"

"No!" David answered firmly.

"Good. It could be drugged, and you’d never see Mommy or Daddy again," she added sternly.

"What if someone says they’ll take you somewhere fun?"

"Don’t go!" they chorused.

Tommy suddenly buried his face in her chest. "Mommy, there are so many bad people outside."

Her heart ached as she stroked his hair. "That’s why you must remember what I’ve taught you."

"Do you know where we live?"

The boys blinked in confusion. Emily realized they didn’t yet understand the concept of an address. Safety education was going to be a long process...
###Chapter 221: Urgent Lessons in Child Safety

Emily Johnson knelt down to eye level with her two sons. "Do you know our exact home address?"

"Stone Village!" Tommy blurted out.

"That's not detailed enough," Emily shook her head. "You need to remember the province, city, county, town, and then the village name."

David blinked, clearly struggling to recall so much information.

"What about your parents' full names?"

The boys exchanged glances before shaking their heads in unison.

"Your father is Michael Stone, and I'm Emily Johnson," she said slowly, emphasizing each word. "Memorize this."

Remembering yesterday's close call, she pressed further. "What should you do if a stranger tries to take you?"

"Find the police!" David answered immediately, gesturing with his small hands. "They wear blue uniforms and hats."

Emily nodded in approval before launching into a thorough safety lesson—never accepting food from strangers, refusing to go anywhere with unfamiliar adults, always staying near a trusted grown-up in public...

The more she spoke, the more she realized how much was left unsaid. During lunch break, she slipped into her room and retrieved several child safety manuals from her hidden inventory.

The case studies made her blood run cold—children snatched in broad daylight, predators targeting distracted mothers carrying groceries. The cruelty was unimaginable.

That afternoon, she gathered her notes and brought both boys to the Stone family home.

"Dad, Mom, still eating?"

John Stone Sr. hastily finished his sweet potato porridge and wiped his mouth. "Finished your materials? Let me see."

He flipped through the thick stack of papers, his frown deepening with each page.

"Discussed it with the other officials today. You're in charge of this," he declared, looking up. "Not many in our brigade finished high school, and you've got city experience. Your voice carries weight."

Emily agreed. "We start tomorrow. Where’s the venue? We’ll need a loudspeaker—I can’t shout over a crowd."

"The threshing ground has one. I’ll ring the assembly bell too," John Sr. added after a pause. "And anyone who skips loses a full day’s work points!"

At dawn the next day, the bell’s peals echoed across the village.

Residents streamed toward the threshing ground, murmuring among themselves.

"What kind of lesson is this important?"

"Something about children..."

"Skip it and kiss your work points goodbye!"

Emily arrived holding her sons’ hands, each boy carrying a small stool. The packed crowd buzzed with uneasy curiosity.

Taking a deep breath, she lifted the loudspeaker—the crucial lesson on protecting their children was about to begin.
###Chapter 222: Anti-Abduction Awareness Class

"Emily, is everything ready?" Old Secretary Benjamin approached with his cane, his brow furrowed. Last night, Captain John had urgently called a meeting, and the discussion had sent chills down his spine.

"All set." Emily tightened her grip on the megaphone.

Captain John stepped forward, lowering his voice. "When you speak, say you witnessed David being abducted. Don't mention it happened to you."

Emily understood immediately. Using a child's example would make the warning more impactful.

The assembly ground grew lively as villagers arrived in small groups, carrying stools and holding their children's hands. Some women cradled nursing infants, soothing them as they walked.

Captain John stood on the makeshift wooden platform, scanning the crowd. Satisfied with the turnout, he gave Emily a nod.

"Begin."

Emily took a deep breath and raised the megaphone. Her clear voice echoed across the field:

"Neighbors, what I'm about to share is frightening, but every word comes from the heart!"

The murmurs in the crowd quieted.

"Yesterday, I took my mother to town, and David came with us. Many of you saw us leave." Her gaze swept over the crowd, and several women nodded in agreement.

"We'd just reached the department store when a burly man suddenly rushed out, snatched David, and ran!" Emily's voice rose sharply. "If I hadn't yanked him back, kicked the man, and if David hadn't screamed for help—"

Before she could finish, the crowd erupted.

"Good heavens! Snatching a child in broad daylight?"

"Exactly! The police said enough children have gone missing these past two years to fill a truck!" Emily seized the moment. "After returning, I reported it to Captain John, who immediately called this meeting."

She deliberately credited Captain John. The old secretary stroked his beard approvingly from below the stage.

When the chatter subsided, Emily raised her voice again:

"Do you know where abducted children end up?" She paused for emphasis. "Those who can't be sold have their legs broken and are forced to beg. If they don't bring in money—" She mimed a heart being torn out.

A woman shrieked and clutched her child tighter.

"And girls?" Emily's tone darkened. "Sold to remote villages, chained up, forced to bear children until their bodies give out!"

The field fell silent. Some young girls began to cry.

Emily then detailed anti-abduction measures: how to spot danger, call for help, and even taught children to memorize their parents' names and their brigade number.

"Remember! Candy from strangers could be poison!" She slammed the lectern for emphasis.

After the meeting, several women surrounded Emily, thanking her profusely. A little girl with a red hair ribbon suddenly dashed over and chirped, "Thank you, Aunt Emily!"

Kneeling, Emily gently pinched her cheek. "Promise you'll remember what I said, okay?"

The setting sun bathed the field in gold. Watching the dispersing crowd, Emily exhaled deeply. She knew today's words might truly save lives.


###Chapter 223: Vigilance Against Abduction

"We owe it all to Emily!"

"If Emily hadn't told us, we'd never have known how terrible it is for children after they're kidnapped."

Emily Johnson pressed her lips together. "I only heard it from the police officers. Thinking about it now still gives me chills."

The anti-abduction lesson left everyone shaken. The horrors Emily described were beyond anything they could have imagined.

Who didn't have children? Who would want their child to suffer such a fate?

On the way home, the villagers couldn't stop talking about it. Soon, the entire brigade had heard the warnings.

Even the children were discussing it.

"They say kidnapped children have their legs broken and are forced to beg..."

"And their organs get stolen!"

Some of the more timid children burst into tears.

A few villagers even sought out David for confirmation.

"David, is everything your mom said true?"

David nodded solemnly. "The police officers said so themselves."

Now, no one dared to let their guard down.

With the New Year approaching, children usually begged to visit the town market. This year, the adults refused outright, terrified of child snatchers.

"If we run into traffickers, how could we old folks fight them off?"

The warnings were relentless:
"Never take candy from strangers!"
"Don't go anywhere with anyone, even if you know them!"
"You can't even trust acquaintances these days!"

At home, David looked up at his mother. "Mom, is it really that bad if you get kidnapped?"

Emily stroked his hair. "Have you ever seen beggars in the city?"

David shook his head.

"That's because they beg in big cities. Our village is too poor—no one spares change here."

Tommy thumped his chest. "I'll never take food from strangers!"

"Remember, even if someone asks for help, don’t agree easily. It could be a trick to lure you somewhere alone."

"Got it!"

Emily thought of Amy Bright. After this, surely she'd be more cautious.

But what if it was an organized gang...

"What's happening in the brigade?" Michael Stone asked, hearing the alarm bell. He'd assumed it was for the New Year's pig slaughter.

Elizabeth Stone returned with their daughters. "Emily nearly lost David the other day. Today, she gave everyone a lesson on avoiding abduction."

"What? David was almost kidnapped?" Michael's face darkened.

The girls chimed in: "No taking candy from strangers! No going with strangers!"

Elizabeth shooed the children out and relayed Emily's warnings in detail.

"That brutal?"

"Emily went to the police station to ask. You should've seen how pale people turned when she mentioned organ harvesting."
###Chapter 224: Emergency Anti-Kidnapping Awareness Campaign

The villagers of Stone Village had always lived in isolation, rarely venturing into town and oblivious to the turmoil of the outside world.

"Is this true?" Mary Stone clutched the hem of her apron, her hands trembling slightly.

Emily Johnson nodded solemnly. "Yes, Mother. Every word."

News spread like wildfire. By dawn the next day, grim tidings arrived—a child had gone missing in neighboring Lopez Village. Panic erupted throughout Stone Village.

"Children must walk home in groups!" bellowed John Stone Sr., slamming his fist on the table. "If I catch any child wandering alone, I'll break their legs myself!"

Richard Lopez arrived under the scorching sun, his eyes bloodshot and voice hoarse. "John, we need help. The child's been missing three days... no trace..."

After a moment's thought, the elder Stone turned to Emily. "What do you think—"

"I'll go," Emily clenched her fists. "But I'll need company."

At noon the next day, Emily stood on Lopez Village's threshing ground. Raising a metal megaphone, her clear voice cut through the sweltering heat:

"First rule: Never accept food from strangers!"
"Second: Shout for help if you see anything suspicious!"

From the sea of villagers, a woman suddenly wailed, "If only I'd known... my baby wouldn't have—"

When the session ended, Richard Lopez pressed a heavy sack of sweet potato noodles into John Stone Sr.'s hands, making the older man grimace under its weight.

"Mommy!" Two small figures came barreling toward Emily like cannonballs.

Mary lifted the pot lid, releasing steam fragrant with sweet potatoes. "Eat first. I'll get you the onion seeds later."

Meanwhile, chaos erupted in the Bright household.

"Mother! You can't favor them like this!" Nancy Bright shrieked. "That worthless niece of ours is nothing compared to our Noah—he'll carry on the family name!"

The elderly woman collapsed on the doorstep, tears streaming down her weathered face. "Such wickedness... she's your own flesh and blood..."

As night deepened, lanterns flickered in both villages like fireflies. No one noticed the pair of cold, calculating eyes watching from the shadowed cornfields.
###Chapter 225: Uncle's Scheme

"Mom, please help me out here!" Thomas Bright rubbed his hands together, grinning obsequiously at Grandma Bright. "Amy's already eighteen. If she doesn't marry soon, she'll be considered an old maid."

Grandma Bright lifted her clouded eyes and gave her youngest son a cold stare. "What did we agree upon during the division of the family? Amy's affairs are none of your concern."

Thomas stomped his foot in frustration. "Samuel can barely take care of himself—how would he know how to find a suitable match for his sister? We've already picked out a good family for her. The groom even has a job in town!"

"Hmph," Grandma Bright scoffed. "This old woman isn't dead yet, and you're already scheming behind my back? Do you want me to report you to the commune for filial disobedience?"

Amy Bright stormed out of the house, her face flushed with anger. "Uncle, my brother will be back soon. Stop plotting against me!"

Thomas's expression darkened. "You ungrateful girl! Opportunities like this don't come twice!"

"It's not your decision to make!" Amy clenched her fists. "If you don't leave now, I'll call the brigade leader!"

At the mention of the brigade leader, Thomas visibly flinched. He shot Amy a venomous glare. "Stubborn fool!" With that, he turned on his heel and stormed off.

The gate slammed shut behind him, and Amy exhaled in relief.

"Grandma, don't worry," she said, helping the old woman back inside. "Samuel will be home soon."

Grandma Bright frowned. "Your uncle won't give up so easily. Go talk to Emily Johnson—she always has good ideas."

Amy nodded and headed to the stove to start cooking. Smoke curled from the chimney, but it did nothing to dispel the unease in her heart.

"Well? Did the girl agree?" Nancy Bright eagerly intercepted her husband as he returned.

Thomas kicked over a stool. "The brat refused outright! And the old woman backed her up!"

"What?" Nancy shrieked. "After all these years of feeding and clothing them, they dare defy us now?"

Thomas's face darkened. "We need to act fast. Once Samuel returns, it'll be too late."

"Tomorrow," Nancy hissed, her eyes glinting maliciously. "When she goes to the river to wash clothes..."

Thomas hesitated. "What if someone sees us?"

"So what?" Nancy sneered. "Once it's done, she'll have no choice but to marry. And the dowry money will be ours..."

Thinking of the funds needed for their own son's wedding, Thomas finally nodded. "We'll go first thing in the morning."

Outside, the wind howled, as if heralding the storm to come.
###Chapter 226: Amy Bright Seeks Emily's Help

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the window as Emily Johnson leaned against the headboard reading a novel. Since her mother's departure, she finally had peace to enjoy her books.

"Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!" Amy Bright's urgent knocking interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in." Emily closed her book, eyeing the unexpected visitor with curiosity.

Amy rushed in, anxiety written across her face. She twisted her clothes nervously, her voice trembling. "Sister-in-law, I'm in trouble."

Emily motioned for her to sit. "Take your time. Tell me what's wrong."

"My uncle Thomas showed up today. He wants to arrange a marriage for me." Amy bit her lip. "But I won't even be seventeen until next year!"

Emily frowned. "I thought your families had separated?" A terrible thought crossed her mind—were they trying to use their niece for dowry money?

"We did separate." Amy stamped her foot angrily. "My cousin Edward is almost twenty. Since Uncle Thomas and Aunt Nancy can't afford his bride price, they're targeting me!"

"Dowries aren't that expensive here. Surely they've saved some money over the years?" Emily asked, puzzled.

Amy scoffed. "They're lazy! If the village officials hadn't witnessed our family separation, they wouldn't even give Grandma her share of grain."

Emily's heart sank. This family might truly stoop to anything for money.

"Can your eldest uncle control them?"

Amy shook her head, her eyes reddening. "He can't."

A horrifying possibility occurred to Emily—what if Amy wasn't kidnapped, but sold by her own uncle's family?

"Listen," Emily lowered her voice, "carry some beans with you. If they try to drug you, you can leave a trail."

She suggested, "Why don't you stay with me for a few days? Until your brother Samuel returns."

"No, I can't trouble you like that." Amy refused firmly.

Emily thought for a moment, then brightened. "Then go cry to the village chief. Tell him your uncle wants to sell you. That should stop them."

Amy's eyes lit up with hope.

"Remember," Emily grasped her hands, "act pitiful. Say you're too young, promise to repay their kindness when you're older. Make everyone take your side."

Amy nodded uncertainly. These tactics went against everything she'd been taught.

"Good girl," Emily said gently. "Women must learn to protect themselves. Sometimes appearing weak is the wisest strategy."
###Chapter 227: Finding Her a Good Match

Emily Johnson picked up a sweet potato, weighing it in her hand. "Amy, look. My uncle and aunt give me ten pounds of coarse grain and ten pounds of sweet potatoes every year. These sweet potatoes—each one is so small and cute."

She then grabbed a handful of rice. "And this ten pounds of fine grain—every time I wash it, I find so many unhusked grains mixed in. It’s a bit troublesome, but at least it’s fine grain, right?"

Amy Bright’s eyes lit up. "I get it! Small sweet potatoes mean low yield, and so many unhusked grains in the fine grain means it wasn’t properly milled."

"Exactly!" Emily nodded in satisfaction. "Once people hear this, they’ll understand exactly what kind of people my uncle and aunt are."

Amy jumped to her feet, excited. "I’ll go try it!"

She dashed toward the brigade office, wiping tears as she ran. A few women lounging by the roadside perked up at the sight.

"Isn’t that the second Bright family’s girl? Why’s she crying like that?"
"Come on, let’s follow and see!"

Amy rushed to the brigade office door and dropped to her knees. "Brigade Leader, please help me!"

John Stone Sr., who was in a meeting, startled and hurried out with the other cadres.

"It’s all my fault—I can’t earn full work points," Amy sobbed. "Now my cousin is getting married, and I don’t even have money for the bride price..."

The gathered villagers erupted in outrage.

"That lazy Thomas Bright is scheming against his niece again?"
"Last time, he kept his daughter’s bride price—now he wants to sell his niece?"

Helen Carter, the women’s director, quickly helped Amy up. "Don’t be afraid, child. What did your uncle say to you?"

Amy lowered her head timidly. "Auntie, maybe... maybe you could find me a good match? Then... then there’d be money for my cousin’s wedding..."

"Outrageous!" An elderly woman slapped her thigh. "Thomas Bright is trying to sell his niece!"

"No, no!" Amy frantically waved her hands. "Uncle is so good to us! He gives Grandma plenty of food!"

Someone nearby scoffed. "Oh, please! Everyone knows he only gives the worst leftovers!"

Amy kept her head down, a faint smile curling at the corners of her lips.
###Chapter 228: Thomas Bright's Scheme

"Oh dear, that Thomas Bright is truly despicable..."

Amy Bright listened to the murmurs around her, a faint smile playing on her lips. She deliberately put on a pitiful expression, her voice barely above a whisper. "My uncle has always been kind to me. He even shares food with Grandma..."

"Pah!" Someone in the crowd spat in disgust.

"If Thomas is filial, then there's no such thing as an unfilial person in our brigade!"

"Everyone knows he's a lazy good-for-nothing. Now he's even scheming against his own niece?"

Helen Carter, the women's director, sighed inwardly. This girl was too naive, still defending those who bullied her.

John Stone Sr., the brigade leader, frowned deeply. "Take her home, then go have a word with Thomas. Tell him if he dares lay a finger on Amy again, he and his wife will be hauling manure next year!"

He remembered clearly how the Bright siblings had fought like cats and dogs when Amy's parents passed away.

"Understood," Helen nodded. "I'll go right away. Demanding money from a niece to marry off their own son—what kind of nonsense is that?"

Amy continued murmuring about her uncles' kindness, how they'd kept her and her brother from starving all these years. Now it was time to repay them.

"Uncle took everything from our house... but he's family..." Her voice trailed off as she lowered her head.

This only fueled the crowd's anger. Grandma Bright was the true elder, yet Thomas shamelessly robbed his own niece!

Helen escorted Amy home, comforting her along the way. Then she marched straight to Thomas's house.

"Thomas Bright!"

"Director Carter! What brings you here?" Thomas's heart sank. Had that wretched girl tattled on him?

"I'm warning you—stay away from Amy! If anything happens to her, you'll answer to me first!"

With that, Helen stormed off.

Thomas and his wife Nancy exchanged uneasy glances.

"That brat went to the brigade leader?" Thomas's face darkened.

"She must have!" Nancy hissed through gritted teeth. "We've already taken the betrothal money—what do we do now?"

"I'll find out." Nancy hurried out.

Villagers shot her contemptuous looks along the way.

"Some people have no shame!"

"Thick-skinned, that's what they are!"

Nancy stomped her foot in frustration. That ungrateful girl—they were doing her a favor finding her a decent match!

"Girls have to marry eventually. We're doing her a kindness!" she seethed inwardly. "Wretched orphan—no wonder her parents died!"
###Chapter 229: The Viper's Scheme

The bitter winter wind cut like knives, but nothing could dampen the villagers' appetite for gossip. The scandal involving the Bright family had spread through the entire production team before noon.

"Did you hear? Thomas Bright and his wife tried to sell their niece for a dowry!" Under the old locust tree at the village entrance, a group of women cracked sunflower seeds between their teeth.

"Disgraceful! They even mixed sand into old Mrs. Bright's grain ration. No conscience at all!"

"That poor girl Amy still thinks her uncle cares for her. Breaks my heart..."

Samuel Bright paused mid-swing, his axe hovering above the firewood. The young man's delicate features darkened as he gazed toward the horizon.

Meanwhile, Nancy Bright fumed in the kitchen, slamming her cleaver into the chopping block. "That wretched girl ruined my reputation!"

Her husband Thomas squatted on the doorstep, cigarette smoke curling around his furrowed brow. "What now? We already took the dowry money."

Nancy's eyes gleamed as she whispered into his ear. Thomas grinned. "Brilliant! I'll go find Peter Wilson right away."

Unbeknownst to them, their every move was being watched. Ethan Miller ducked behind a haystack before tailing Thomas through the village.

Emily Johnson hung laundry in her yard, a faint smile touching her lips when she spotted Ethan sprinting toward her.

"Mommy!" Tommy Stone came running, waving his completed handwriting practice. "I finished!"

Emily ruffled his hair. "Excellent! Go get some hawthorn rolls."

The children's cheers echoed as they raced outside, soon surrounded by playmates. David Stone broke the candy into pieces, distributing them like a benevolent monarch.

"Miss Emily's treats are the best!" Lucy Stone licked her fingers.

Beyond the village, Thomas Bright slipped into a copse of trees with furtive glances. Ethan crept after him, heart pounding like a drum.

As dusk settled, storm clouds gathered—both in the sky and among the villagers. None could predict what tempest would break when dawn came to this quiet hamlet...
###Chapter 230: A Foolish Scheme

Emily Johnson flipped through her literature textbook, sunlight streaming through the window onto the yellowed pages. Though a science student, she couldn't neglect humanities. The curriculum in this era differed vastly from what she remembered, each lesson carrying an unfamiliar tone.

While reviewing her studies, she waited for news.

Amy Bright had been marked. Given her uncle and aunt's greedy nature, they'd never let such prey escape. After today's incident, that couple would likely accelerate their plans.

"David, fetch Ethan for me," she closed her book, eyes glinting sharply.

Soon, Ethan Miller arrived panting.

"What is it, sis?"

"Keep watch near the Brights' place, especially if they leave the village to visit anyone," she instructed in a hushed tone. "Stay vigilant."

Some people needed to be taught a lesson. Thinking they could act recklessly just because of their seniority was laughable. Overestimating themselves while scheming—how pathetic.

Meanwhile, Margaret Johnson finally returned to their provincial city home, arms laden with packages.

"Accountant Li's back?" called their neighbor Mrs. Wang. "Didn't Emily come with you?"

These days, every family had youth sent to the countryside—those who passed exams returned; those who failed remained stuck in rural hardship.

"Too tired from the trip. Let's chat another day," Margaret forced a smile, unlocking the door.

The empty house echoed with silence—family members were either working or at school. Dropping her luggage, she exhaled deeply. Retrieving items from a fertilizer bag, she repacked some and headed to the nearby state-run restaurant.

Among several such establishments in the city, her second son Anthony worked as a chef at this one.

"Chef Johnson, your mother's here," a server announced, lifting the kitchen curtain.

Anthony paused his vegetable chopping, wiped his hands, and excused himself from his father-in-law.

"Mom!" His face brightened at the sight of her. "You came back alone?"

Anxiety laced his words. He'd sent a telegram, but his younger sister never replied.

"Emily sent these for you." Margaret handed him the package.

Anthony froze. His sister still remembered him? Warmth flooded his chest, lips curving unconsciously.

"How... is she?" he asked cautiously. Close in age, they'd always been affectionate siblings.

"She's married. Did you know?"

"What?" Anthony nearly dropped the package in shock. Fumbling to catch it, his face paled.

His little sister married? Such a major event kept secret from the family?

Then again, all these years they'd only sent parcels—no one ever visited her. Had they gone sooner, they wouldn't be learning this only now. Could she be... settling permanently in the countryside?

Even the worst city job surpassed rural life.

Suddenly, he recalled his sister-in-law's scheme—using arranged marriage to advance his elder brother's career. That dream would now be shattered.

"I didn't know..." Anthony's voice turned hoarse. "I thought she was still angry. Back then, she didn't have to go to the countryside—our family could've afforded to keep her..."

His words trailed off, thick with regret.
###Chapter 231: The Truth Comes to Light

"We could have scraped together the money back then..." Margaret Johnson's voice trembled.

She remembered it clearly. That day, her eldest daughter-in-law had come to her with red-rimmed eyes, saying the factory supervisors were watching their family. If they didn't send a child to the countryside, her husband's job might be at risk.

"Mom, think about it. If someone reports us, he'll lose his job."

Those words had hardened Henry Johnson's resolve to send Emily away.

"Emily said she never signed up." Margaret clenched the hem of her shirt.

Anthony Johnson's enamel mug clattered to the floor, hot water splashing everywhere.

"If she didn't, then who did?" His head snapped up, meeting his mother's bloodshot eyes.

The same realization struck them both.

"Bring your wife home tonight," Margaret said coldly. "We're dividing the family assets."

Anthony gave a bitter smile. "Didn't Sister-in-law say... as a live-in son-in-law, I have no right to the inheritance?"

"Your father and I aren't dead yet!" Margaret turned on her heel and left.

Watching his mother's hunched back, Anthony suddenly laughed.

"Dad, Emily sent some dried vegetables." Chef Zhao held up the package proudly. "We'll cook them with meat someday."

His fingers brushed against the heavy slab of cured meat inside, his heart twisting with mixed emotions. Was Emily doing alright in the countryside?

Then he recalled his mother's words. If Emily hadn't signed up... who else could it have been?

Their eldest sister had married out long ago. Him and their younger brother... that left only...

"I'm such a fool." He smacked his forehead hard. All these years, and only now did he understand.

Margaret went straight to the factory to find Henry.

"Why are you back?" Henry frowned. "Where is she?"

"She didn't come."

"Nonsense!" Henry slammed his hand on the table. "After all these years, she's still holding a grudge?"

"About being sent to the countryside..." Margaret met his gaze squarely. "Emily didn't sign up."

Henry's raised hand froze mid-air.

"She said that herself?"

"Someone signed her up." Margaret enunciated each word.

Henry's face paled. "They'd need the household register to..." His voice trailed off as the implication hit him.

The room fell deathly silent.
###Chapter 232: Vicious Scheme

"Henry, do you remember?" Margaret Johnson's voice suddenly choked with emotion. "That day Emily cried and said if we forced her to the countryside, she'd never acknowledge us again."

Henry Johnson's fingers trembled slightly. How could he forget? His youngest daughter's tear-filled eyes still haunted his dreams.

"But back then..."

"Back then, Amy Bright said withdrawing after signing up would affect their jobs." Margaret let out a bitter laugh. "Looking back now, from sending Emily away to forcing Anthony into that arranged marriage—we were all dancing to her tune."

Henry opened his mouth, but no words came out.

"Let's divide the family tonight." Margaret turned to leave. "Richard and his wife both have jobs. It's time they stood on their own."

"Wait!" Henry finally found his voice. "What about Emily...?"

"She's married." Margaret paused, her tone eerily calm. "To the village chief's son. She has two bright children now. She said she'd only return if she could bring her husband and kids with her."

Henry staggered back two steps, hitting the wall. Only then did it strike him—Emily had been the prettiest of all their children. And in a place like that...

"She... really won't come back?"

Margaret didn't answer. She walked out, her shadow stretching long in the setting sun.

Meanwhile, the aroma of noodles filled the Stone family courtyard.

"Sis!" Ethan Miller burst in, panting. "I saw Thomas Bright meeting with some man in his thirties—they were talking about money and... sleeping with someone!"

Emily's chopsticks clattered onto the table. She understood instantly—they were planning to force the matter!

"Ethan, eat first." She suppressed her fury. "After dinner, we're going to see Chief Stone. They're making their move tonight."

The two boys nervously shoveled noodles into their mouths. Ethan's hands wouldn't stop shaking.

By full nightfall, a small group approached the old Stone residence with flashlights. The village was unnervingly quiet, their footsteps echoing sharply in the dark.

"Dad! Dad!"

John Stone Sr. threw on a coat and opened the door to find his daughter-in-law standing outside with the children and Ethan. His heart sank.

"What's wrong?"

The night wind rustled fallen leaves as distant dogs barked. A storm was brewing in the darkness.
###Chapter 233: Schemes of the Heart

"What brings you here?" Captain John Stone Sr. frowned as his son and daughter-in-law appeared unannounced at his doorstep.

"Dad, let's talk inside," Michael Stone murmured, glancing meaningfully toward the house.

The old family home, now occupied only by the elderly couple, felt eerily empty.

"Ethan, tell the Captain what you saw with Thomas Bright," Emily Johnson nudged the boy beside her.

Ethan launched into an animated account, complete with gestures.

Captain Stone's face darkened as he listened. He slammed his fist on the table. "That Thomas Bright! Ignoring my warnings! First selling his own daughter, now scheming against his niece!"

Emily shook her head inwardly. The Bright couple's cruelty knew no bounds.

"I'm going to confront them right now!"

"Dad!" Emily intercepted him urgently. "They'll just deny everything if we barge in. Here's what we should do instead..."

She whispered her plan, and the older man's eyes lit up.

Mary Stone hugged her grandsons tightly, worry lining her face. "Leave David and Tommy with me. Be careful."

The Captain gathered a few nephews, and the four men quietly took up positions near Amy Bright's home.

Night deepened, the biting wind cutting through their clothes.

Inside, Amy and Grandma Bright had retired early. The innocent girl believed her uncle's gift of meat stew had been given out of kindness.

She never suspected the sinister motive behind that bowl.

Meanwhile, tension hung thick in the Johnson household.

Margaret Johnson had summoned both sons home—an unusual occurrence. At dinner, Victoria Johnson sensed something amiss with her mother-in-law.

"I called you here to discuss dividing the household," Margaret announced calmly, setting down her chopsticks.

"Dividing?" Victoria nearly dropped her bowl.

Catherine Johnson gasped, pinching her husband's arm under the table.

"Mom, why now?" Richard Johnson frowned.

Margaret studied her sons. "Branches must spread when the tree grows tall. You're married men—it's time to establish your own homes."

Victoria tugged frantically at her husband's sleeve. The family assets belonged to her son!

Anthony, however, nodded calmly. "Don't worry, we'll still fulfill our filial duties after the division."

Catherine quickly added, "Of course! After all you've done for us, we'd never neglect you."

Margaret noted Victoria's panicked expression with a sinking heart.

All these years, she'd been blind to such calculations.
###Chapter 234: The Johnson Family Division

Victoria Johnson clenched the hem of her shirt, her nails digging into her palms. She glared at her brother-in-law and his wife, her mind in turmoil—why did they have to divide the family again after already doing it once?

"Richard, are you against the division?" Henry Johnson's sharp gaze cut into his eldest son like a blade. He remembered the words his daughter-in-law had spoken years ago at the dinner table when he had wanted to bring Emily home after her first year in the countryside.

Richard Johnson shivered under his father's stare. "If you say we should divide, and Anthony agrees, then we'll do it."

"Mom! Dad!" Victoria's voice rose in panic. "Even if we divide, as the eldest son and daughter-in-law, we should take care of you!" She shot her husband meaningful glances, urging him to speak up.

Henry scoffed and pulled out a cloth bundle from his pocket. "This is the family savings—3,200."

He paused, his eyes sweeping over his two sons. "I plan to give 800 to Emily as her dowry and compensation. You all know how much she suffered in the countryside."

"I have no objections!" Anthony boomed. "Richard loves his little sister the most—of course he agrees." He emphasized the words "loves the most" while glancing pointedly at Victoria.

Eight hundred?! Victoria nearly ground her teeth to dust. That worthless girl didn’t deserve that much! She was the one who had borne the Johnson family's first grandson!

"I... have no objections," Richard forced out. The moment the words left his mouth, his wife pinched his arm hard.

Henry counted out eight hundred-dollar bills and handed them to his wife. "Keep this safe for Emily when she returns." Margaret Johnson wiped her tears—this sum wasn’t even a fraction of what their daughter had earned in work points all those years.

"The remaining 2,400 will be split equally between you two." Henry divided the money into two stacks. "Richard, why is your wife glaring at me? Think Emily got too much? You spent more than this on your wedding!"

Anthony swiftly counted his share and handed it to his wife, then suddenly raised his voice. "Mom, why didn’t Emily come back with you? If someone hadn’t secretly signed her up back then, she wouldn’t have suffered all this! I curse that person to die alone in old age!"

Victoria's teacup clattered to the floor. She scrambled to pick up the pieces, cutting her finger on a shard—because years ago, she had been the one who sneaked to the neighborhood office to register Emily's name, all because her mother-in-law kept saving eggs for that worthless girl...

"Move out after the New Year," Henry said coldly, his gaze freezing over as he stared at Richard and his family. "Richard, take your wife and children and find another place to live."
###Chapter 235: Not Afraid At All

"What? Moving out after the family splits?" Victoria Johnson shot up from her seat, her bowl and chopsticks clattering loudly.

Anthony Johnson leisurely picked up another bite of food. "If you and Richard don't want to move, that's fine. You can stay with your parents, and Catherine and I will move back here. It's livelier when we're all together."

Victoria's face turned ashen. Her parents' cramped house barely had room to turn around.

"Catherine's right," Catherine Johnson spoke up, her tone measured. "If Richard doesn't move out soon, he'll miss his chance at the factory housing allocation. By seniority, this year should be his turn."

Her words landed like a bomb, sending shockwaves across the table.

Catherine calmly continued eating. Working at the Supply & Market counter, she'd long mastered keeping her composure under scrutiny.

"Anthony's wife makes a good point," Henry Johnson said firmly, setting down his chopsticks. "Richard's worked at the factory for years—it's time he got housing. If you don't move, you'll never qualify."

Victoria twisted her hands anxiously. She'd been counting on her sons staying close to their grandparents to secure the family inheritance. But if they moved out...

"Mom, where's Emily? Why didn't she come back with you?" Victoria abruptly changed the subject, her eyes darting around. She still hoped her sister-in-law could help her out.

All eyes turned to Margaret Johnson.

"She's married," Margaret said coldly.

"Married?!" Victoria shrieked before lowering her voice. "How could she not tell us about something so important? We're her closest family—"

"Closest family?" Anthony slammed his chopsticks down. "Is that why you signed her up for that rural labor program behind her back? And sent her to the poorest region—the Northern Wilderness?"

Victoria's back went rigid. How had this old secret resurfaced?

"Mom, how is Emily doing now?" Catherine quickly interjected, pinching her husband's arm.

Margaret sighed. "She married the village chief's son, Michael Stone. They have two boys—David, five, and Tommy, three. Both can already recite the Three Character Classic. The young man treats her well—built her the best brick house in the village..."

"Five years old and reciting classics?" Anthony's eyes lit up. "My nephew's that bright? What's the husband like? Does he treat Emily right?"

"Very well," Margaret finally smiled. "Emily hasn't worked in the fields since marrying. I didn't see Michael this time—he was away on a delivery..."

Victoria clenched her fists until her knuckles turned white. How did that little wretch get so lucky? She'd have to find a way...
###Chapter 236: She Would Be the First to Object

Victoria Johnson clenched the dishrag in her hands until her knuckles turned white. How dare her mother-in-law praise that country bumpkin sister-in-law at the dinner table? And even compliment those brats of hers?

"Just two wild country children," she seethed inwardly, though her face remained carefully blank.

Margaret Johnson's sharp gaze swept across the table, making Victoria immediately lower her head and pretend to wipe the table. But the disdain in her eyes hadn't escaped her mother-in-law's notice.

"Emily is doing very well now," Margaret declared, raising her voice slightly. "Her husband takes excellent care of her—she's even more radiant than when she lived in the city. And those two grandsons of mine are plump and fair-skinned, absolutely adorable."

Anthony Johnson's eyes lit up. "Really? Emily was always the prettiest. She must be stunning now!"

"You'll see for yourself when they return to the city," Henry Johnson interjected.

Return to the city? The dishrag slipped from Victoria's fingers and hit the floor with a soft thud. Were her in-laws actually considering...?

Her head snapped up just in time to catch Catherine Johnson's knowing smirk. That sister-in-law definitely knew something!

"No!" Victoria screamed internally. That job of Margaret's was worth a fortune! How could they even think of giving it to a married-off daughter? She would be the first to object!

Catherine leisurely cracked sunflower seeds between her teeth, deliberately ignoring Victoria's pleading look.

"My parents can give their jobs to whoever they please," she thought coldly. "If you hadn't schemed to send Emily to the countryside in the first place, we wouldn't be in this mess."

"Catherine," Anthony asked guilelessly, "do you think Emily will still recognize me? I've gained quite a bit of weight."

Catherine burst out laughing. "With that belly of yours, she'd have to be blind not to."

Victoria gritted her teeth. How could this woman be so obtuse? This was the time to present a united front!

"It's getting late. Time for everyone to head home," Henry announced, rising to see them out.

Catherine promptly pulled her husband to his feet. "We'll be going now, Mom and Dad."

Outside, Anthony scratched his head. "That was clever of you back there, dear."

Catherine rolled her eyes. "Oh, you..." She lowered her voice. "Your brother definitely knows what happened back then. Don't play the fool with me."

Under the moonlight, their shadows stretched long across the ground. Catherine linked arms with her husband, thinking: This idiot might be slow, but at least his heart's in the right place.
###Chapter 237: Karma Strikes Back

People like this are the most terrifying.

Anthony Johnson snorted coldly. "Even if Richard knows, he'd keep it from us. Every time we bring up Emily returning to the city, he stays silent. Since when did he become like this?"

"Now that he's married, he has his own family to think about."

Anthony thought of his brother-in-law, whom he'd never met. "Catherine, what kind of man do you think Michael is? Mom said Emily doesn’t work in the fields, yet they built a brick house and wear new clothes?"

Catherine had seen her sister-in-law before she was sent to the countryside.

Though spoiled, Emily had been simple-minded—just like her foolish husband. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been manipulated into such a dire situation.

"He probably isn’t ugly. Emily would never marry an unattractive man, no matter how desperate. Being able to build a brick house in the countryside and raise three children—he must have been involved in that business for a while."

Black-market dealings.

"Now that policies have loosened, he can operate more freely. If he’s the type I’m thinking of, Emily’s family might be wealthier than ours."

Private businesses did make money.

But one needed connections—and guts.

"No way!"

Catherine chuckled. "You never know. Why don’t you write and ask?"

She remembered her mother-in-law mentioning that Emily had bought sleeper tickets for their return trip.

In the past, only officials could afford those.

"I’ll write as soon as we get back."

"Mom wants to give her job to Emily. What do you think?"

"I don’t mind. But Victoria will definitely object."

If they’d given the job to Emily back then, she wouldn’t have been sent to the countryside.

"Of course she’d object. After all that scheming, she won’t let it go to waste. Let’s hurry home—it’s freezing."

"Alright, let’s go."

——

At the Johnson residence.

Victoria’s room.

"How did Emily end up married in the countryside?"

Richard wasn’t sure either.

But he vaguely understood—if Emily hadn’t been sent away, she wouldn’t have married a rural man.

"Is Mom planning to give her job to Emily?"

"I don’t know. Let’s sleep."

——

Stone Village.

John Stone Sr. and his men had been crouching outside Amy Bright’s house for so long they were nearly frozen stiff when movement finally stirred.

"They’re coming..."

John signaled Michael to go first with a club.

The others followed.

"Take him away!"

Michael obeyed his uncle, dragging the man off without hesitation.

"What are you doing?"

Doing?

They hauled him to the wilderness.

"Stealing from our village? Straight to the police."

The man panicked when he recognized John. "No, I didn’t—I wasn’t!"

Everyone in nearby villages knew Stone Village handed thieves over to the authorities.

"I swear! I was just looking for someone!"

Looking for someone?

At Amy Bright’s house?

"Dad, should we make him tell the truth?" Emily narrowed her eyes. If not for this man, would she be freezing out here in the middle of the night?

"Emily, forget it. If we cripple him, we’ll have to pay compensation."

Cripple him?

Who was this man?

And who was this woman?

Why was she so ruthless?

###Chapter 238: Tit for Tat

"I'm not a thief! Thomas Bright sent me!" The man struggled desperately against the hands pinning him to the ground.

Emily Johnson sneered as she lifted his chin with a wooden stick. "Oh? So Thomas told you to steal? Or was it to harass women?"

"I... I..." The man stammered, his eyes darting around nervously.

Michael Stone kept him pinned, but a chill ran down his spine. Emily had always seemed so gentle—why did her gaze suddenly feel so terrifying?

"Ethan, gag him," Emily turned away. "Let's go settle this with Thomas."

The night wind howled as the group marched toward the Bright residence, their anger palpable.

Bang! Bang! Bang! The knocking shattered the silence of the night.

"Who—who is it?" Thomas's voice quivered with guilt.

No one answered—only more urgent pounding.

Trembling, Thomas opened the door to find John Stone Sr. glaring at him, his expression thunderous.

"Thomas Bright, you've got some nerve!" John barked.

"Captain, wh-what did I do?" Thomas's legs nearly gave out.

Emily stepped forward. "Dad, Thomas conspired with an outsider to steal from the village. We caught him red-handed."

"That's a lie! I didn't!" Thomas jumped in panic.

Right on cue, Ethan yanked the gag from the captive's mouth.

"Thomas! You told me your village had a good harvest this year! You even pointed out which families had money!" the man blurted.

Thomas turned ghostly pale. "You're framing me!"

Emily smirked. "Funny. Out of everyone, why would he name you?"

Thomas scrambled for an excuse. "I—I owe him money! He's lying for revenge!"

"Is that so?" Emily's gaze slid meaningfully to the captive.

The man shuddered. "Y-yes! He owes me money..."

Nancy Bright rushed out. "Captain, my husband is an honest man! He'd never steal!"

"Honest?" Emily scoffed. "Honest men sneak outsiders into the village at midnight?"

John's voice was steel. "Thomas, this isn't over. Tomorrow, you'll answer to the entire village."

Thomas collapsed to the ground, watching the group leave with gritted teeth. His perfect plan—how had it unraveled?

Emily lingered, casting one last glance at the Bright house. A cold smile curled her lips. Try to hurt me? Let’s see how you like your own medicine.
###Chapter 239: Even a Fool Knows the Choice

"He owes me twenty dollars," the man shouted, his neck stiff with defiance.

Twenty dollars?
Uncle Thomas Bright immediately jumped to his feet. "That's a lie! It was only ten!"

A ten-dollar deal?
"Pay up," the man demanded, already plotting to drag Thomas into trouble once he got the money.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Thomas had no choice but to go inside and fetch the cash. His wife Nancy stomped her feet in frustration—that was money she'd saved for their son's future wedding!

The moment the money changed hands, the man turned on them. "Thomas put me up to this! He even gave me the address!"

His reasoning was simple: since Thomas was Amy Bright's uncle, he'd get off easy if things went south.

"Bullshit! My husband would never do such a thing!" Nancy shrieked. With the village chief present, she'd rather die than admit anything.

The chief frowned. "Either pay for the stolen goods, or I'll hand you over to the authorities. Your choice."

Was there even a choice?

"How much?"

"Ten dollars each."

Nancy nearly ground her teeth to dust.

Emily Johnson's voice was icy. "Send them to the police—"

Nancy instantly deflated.

After collecting the twenty dollars and watching the man slink away, everyone dispersed.

"Nancy, remind Amy Bright tomorrow to stay alert."

"Got it."

The children were nodding off but perked up when the adults returned.

"Ethan, let me walk you home."

The night was pitch black, without even a streetlamp in sight.

"I know the way, Mrs. Johnson!" Ethan dashed off before she could insist.

"Mommy... sleep..."

Too tired to even wash up, Emily hurried the kids to bed.

This wasn't over.

Thomas and Nancy wouldn't let this slide.

"David, go get Amy. Be careful."

"On it!"

David pocketed some snacks and took Tommy with him.

"David, did they slaughter a pig today?"

"Yeah!"

"Your family eats meat every day, right?"

"My grandma brought these milk candies last time—they're so good!" David shared hawthorn rolls with his friends. "Here, try these!"

The children burst into laughter.

Amy walked toward Emily's house, puzzled. Why was she being summoned so early? Maybe it was about New Year preparations?

"Mrs. Johnson..."

Emily closed her book, her expression grave. "I didn't want to tell you, but I'm worried for your safety."

"What's wrong?"

Two crisp ten-dollar bills landed on the table.

"Mrs. Johnson, what is this?" Amy panicked. She'd only helped out—this was too much money.
###Chapter 240: Rather Die with Honor Than Live in Shame

"Your uncle has arranged a marriage for you," Emily Johnson whispered, her eyes darting around cautiously. "They're afraid you'll refuse, so they plan to force the issue."

Amy Bright's sewing needle clattered to the ground.

"Last night, the village head and I kept watch outside your house until midnight," Emily said, gripping Amy's icy hands. "The man admitted your uncle sent him. Once the scandal breaks, even if your brother returns, it'll be too late."

Amy's face turned ashen, her lips trembling wordlessly.

"Sister-in-law..." she finally managed, "how did you find out?"

"I've suspected your uncle for a while," Emily said coldly. "When he brought those pancakes last night, I knew something was wrong."

Amy clenched her clothes tightly. She'd believed her uncle had truly changed...

"Lock your door tonight," Emily pressed a wad of cash into her hand. "Don't eat anything they give you. Stay alert until your brother comes home."

"I can't take this money—"

"Take it!" Emily insisted firmly. "I'm afraid they might resort to desperate measures, even..."

Amy's head snapped up, her pupils contracting in horror.

"Trafficking?" Her voice shook.

Emily nodded gravely. "Better safe than sorry."

But why are you being so kind to me... Amy's eyes burned with unshed tears.

"Isn't the village slaughtering a pig today?" she changed the subject. "Are you going to collect meat?"

"You go ahead," Emily calculated. "I'll come later for some trotters and bones."

The threshing ground of River Village buzzed with excitement. The butcher's blade flashed, and the fat pig gave one final squeal.

"Where's Emily? Isn't she coming?" a woman asked Mary Stone.

Mary glanced around. "Probably tending to the children."

Nearby, David and Tommy Stone raced home.

"Mom!" Tommy shouted. "If we don't hurry, there'll be no meat left!"

Emily adjusted her scarf leisurely. "No need to rush. The meat won't walk away."

"But the fatty cuts will be gone!" David stomped impatiently.

Emily smiled faintly. She'd be glad if everyone fought over the fatty portions.
###Chapter 241: The Pig Butchering Day

"Mommy, hurry up!" David tugged at Tommy's hand as they bounced around the yard.

Emily Johnson carried a vegetable basket, following her two lively boys toward the threshing ground. The metallic scent of blood hit her nostrils long before they arrived—the area was already crowded with villagers.

"Emily, come help with the accounts!" Captain John Stone spotted her immediately and waved her over.

She quickened her pace and took the ledger. Her slender fingers flew across the paper, numbers appearing one after another in swift succession.

"This..." The accountant gaped. "How are you so fast?"

"Mommy's the best!" Tommy puffed out his little chest proudly.

The butchers, who had been working at a leisurely pace, suddenly found themselves rushing to keep up after Emily's arrival. The pile of pork on the chopping block visibly shrank.

"Emily, I saved this prime cut for you," one butcher said ingratiatingly.

She shook her head. "I'll take the trotters and bones. And... those intestines."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

"That stuff stinks and is filthy..."

"City folks are so strange..."

Emily tuned out the murmurs, focusing on the calculations. By noon, every family's share had been distributed.

"Let's go home and cook something delicious." She hefted the basket filled with pig's feet and bones, her two little shadows hopping behind her.

"Mommy, those guts smell awful..." David pinched his nose.

"They'll taste great once cleaned." Emily winked mysteriously. "We'll invite Grandma and Grandpa for dinner tonight."

No sooner had she set the basket down at home than Mary Stone pushed through the door.

"I knew you'd pick these." Mary rolled up her sleeves. "I'll wash them at the river. You start the stew."

By dusk, mouthwatering aromas wafted through the yard.

"Smells amazing!" Tommy drooled by the kitchen doorway.

Emily lifted the pot lid to reveal creamy bone broth bubbling with radishes and kelp. In another pot, glistening braised pork knuckles simmered in rich sauce.

"Dinner's ready!"

The family gathered around the table, even the two boys who'd earlier wrinkled their noses at the intestines now eating with greasy enthusiasm.

Meanwhile, miles away...

"Michael, sleeper tickets are sold out," Samuel Bright reported dejectedly.

Michael Stone clapped his shoulder. "Any ticket home is fine. Pack up—we leave tomorrow."

The group of men exchanged glances, each seeing the same homesick urgency reflected in the others' eyes.
###Chapter 242: The Broken Engagement Lesson

"Missing my girl," Charles Clark rubbed his hands together, his gaze drifting toward the village entrance.

Emily Johnson shot him a glance. "Keep it down, especially you." She lowered her voice. "Don't let last year's lipstick incident happen again."

Charles immediately deflated. That imported lipstick had cost him his would-be bride.

The train station buzzed with noise. The group carried bags of all sizes, their hearts already back in Stone Village.

"Sis, going to the market?" Amy Bright sidled up. "New Year's coming—I want to buy some candies and nuts..."

Emily hoisted her bamboo basket. Two small heads peeked through the door crack. "Don't worry, Mom! We'll guard the house!"

The tractor sputtered black smoke as the crowd squeezed into its bed, chatting and laughing.

Suddenly, the vehicle lurched to a halt.

"What happened?" someone cried.

The driver jumped down, circling the machine in frustration. Sweat beaded along his temples.

"Emily, your little Michael knows engines. How about you?"

Every eye turned to her. Emily swallowed hard and climbed down.

The stench of motor oil hit her. She crouched, pretending expertise as she inspected the machinery.

"I'll try," she wiped her hands. "Someone in my family works at the factory. Picked up a thing or two."

When the engine roared to life, the whole group cheered.

"Emily's full of surprises!"
"Did you see how fast she calculated the meat rations yesterday?"

The town swarmed with people. Emily mentally checked her shopping list: raisins, canned goods, chocolate... Her basket filled quickly.

"Amy, keep watch." She winked mysteriously.

In a shadowy alley, figures huddled in whispers. Emily produced some ration coupons and exchanged them for scarce goods.

A long queue snaked from the Supply & Market entrance. Amy stood on tiptoe. "Sis, is that—"

"Shh." Emily pressed a finger to her lips. "Talk later."

As the sun dipped low, the tractor's shadow stretched long across the road. The scent of roasted nuts mingled with the rhythmic snores from the wagon bed.
###Chapter 243: New Year Shopping Spree

"It's almost New Year. Time to stock up." Emily Johnson swung her woven basket over her shoulder and headed briskly toward the village entrance.

"Emily, going to town?" Mrs. Wilson called out, spotting her. "Buying so much?"

Emily smiled faintly. "Just getting some new clothes for the kids."

The villagers all knew Emily's mother had visited recently, lugging a hefty bundle. Who knew what treasures were stuffed inside?

"Emily, come here." Daisy Miller pulled her aside conspiratorially.

In a quiet corner, Emily lowered her voice. "I got a few pairs of Liberation Shoes. No coupons needed."

Daisy's eyes lit up. "Really? I'll get the money right now!"

Liberation Shoes were hot commodities at the Supply & Market, impossible to buy without industrial coupons—which rural folks never had. This chance couldn't be missed!

Amy Bright trailed behind, eyeing Emily's basket hungrily. She wanted some too, but bringing home such goods might raise eyebrows.

"Sis, I... maybe not this time."

The moment Emily entered the yard, two little figures came barreling toward her. "Mommy!"

"Good boys. Close the door." She set the basket on the table and lifted the cloth cover. "Amy, sure you don't want any? This won't happen again."

Amy stared at the pristine shoes, fingers twisting her hem. "I... I'll take two pairs. But the money—"

"Take them first. Pay later." Emily swiftly sorted through the basket's contents. "What size?"

Apples, pastries, candies... Amy's head spun. How much had this cost?

"Just... just a few apples for me."

After settling accounts, Amy hurried off. "I'll bring the money soon!"

Emily handed the pastries to her boys. "Try these. Bought them just for you."

"Mommy's the best!" they cheered.

No sooner had she tidied up than Daisy came rushing in. "Emily, any shoes left?"

"Right here. Pick what you want."

Daisy selected two pairs, hands trembling as she counted out cash. "Five dollars a pair?"

"Same price as the Supply & Market, minus the coupons." Emily smiled.

After Daisy left, Emily packed two pairs of shoes and some New Year treats. "Let's go to Grandma's for dinner."

The boys skipped along behind her. Neither noticed the shadow flitting past the corner of the wall...
###Chapter 244: The New Year's Gift Controversy

"Well, look who it is—Emily Johnson!" Aunt Wang's sharp eyes spotted Emily walking toward the old house with a bamboo basket.

Aunt Li cracked sunflower seeds between her teeth and squinted. "Hmph, that basket looks heavy!"

"Emily, bringing New Year's gifts to your in-laws?" Aunt Zhang called out loudly.

Emily paused mid-step, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Yes, Mother Stone asked me to bring some things over."

The women exchanged knowing glances. Everyone knew Emily had just returned from town with a cart full of New Year's supplies.

"How many times is this now?" Aunt Wang muttered under her breath. "They only split from the family recently, and the third son's household is already visiting so often."

"Exactly!" Aunt Li scoffed. "They used to say Michael Stone forgot his mother after marrying, but now his wife is even more filial than he ever was."

Ignoring the gossip behind her, Emily walked straight to the gate of the old house.

"Father, Mother!" she called out cheerfully.

Mary Stone, who had been airing quilts in the yard, looked up, her face brightening. "Oh, Michael's wife is here!"

"Grandma!" Two little figures darted out from behind Emily and threw themselves into Mary's arms.

"Mom said we're having lunch here today!" David announced, tilting his little face up.

John Stone Sr. emerged from the house and frowned slightly at the basket in Emily's hands. "Brought more things?"

Emily lifted the cloth cover with a smile. "I saw these shoes in town and thought you both could use a pair."

"How much did these cost?" Mary gasped as she took the shoes, torn between delight and worry.

"No coupons needed—they were a bargain," Emily said with a wink. "Consider it making up for lost time."

The basket also held canned goods, apples, and candies, leaving the elderly couple speechless.

"You silly girl..." Mary's eyes grew moist. "We agreed when you moved out..."

"Mother," Emily linked arms with her mother-in-law, "isn't the whole point of Michael earning money to give our family a better life?"

John Sr. puffed on his pipe and suddenly asked, "Is it really true—people can do business freely now?"

"Father, if you don't believe me, I'll take you to town one day," Emily said mysteriously. "It's bustling there."

Just then, a commotion erupted outside the gate.

"Michael Stone is back!"

The apple nearly slipped from Emily's grasp. She whirled around to see a cloud of dust at the gate, where several travel-worn figures were approaching.

"Third Brother!" Daniel River's booming voice carried from afar.

But what made Emily's heart race was the tall figure leading the group.

Michael Stone had returned.

And behind him stood several brothers with odd expressions.

"Wife..." Michael stopped at the gate, his intense gaze fixed on her. "I heard... your mother came by?"

Emily's stomach dropped. She could clearly see the flicker of panic in her husband's eyes.

This was bad.
###Chapter 245: Eager to Return Home

"Emily is still at the production team!" The woman clapped her hands. "Oh, and your David was almost kidnapped! You'd better hurry home!"

The men's faces darkened instantly. Grabbing their bags, they sprinted forward.

"Michael, your wife still cares about you," Charles panted. "She didn't leave with her mother."

The words cut through Michael Stone like a knife.

"Let's all head home first," another brother said tactfully. "You two must have a lot to talk about."

They all knew how city folks looked down on villagers. That's why they'd dressed properly for this business trip—to avoid being laughed at.

"Right."

Michael quickened his pace. Fear gnawed at him—fear that his mother-in-law would scorn him as a country bumpkin, fear that his wife might be persuaded to return to the city.

As the sun dipped westward, he pushed open the gate to find David squatting in the yard, playing with pebbles.

"Dad!" The boy's face lit up as he dashed over.

Michael scooped him up and strode toward the house.

"Where's Mom?"

"Reading inside," David said, clinging to his neck. "We didn't disturb her."

After setting his eldest down, Michael pinched Tommy's cheek. "I'm going to see your mother."

Tommy tried to follow but David held him back. "Let them talk."

Inside, Emily had heard everything. She'd deliberately stayed put, but when footsteps paused outside the door, her heart skipped a beat.

"Sweetheart..."

The door swung open. A tall figure, still dusty from travel, rushed in. Before she could react, strong arms enveloped her.

"I missed you," Michael murmured hoarsely, his warm breath brushing her ear.

"Mmm." Pressed against his chest, she inhaled his familiar scent—sunshine mingled with sweat.

This embrace felt like coming home. Her wandering heart had finally found its harbor.

"We made good money this time." Michael released her, eyes shining.

"That's wonderful." Emily smiled.

"I didn't bring you anything." He looked sheepish. "I kept remembering what you said..."

"This is perfect."

Suddenly tense, Michael asked, "I heard... your mother came?"

Ah, so that's what worried him. Emily arched a brow. "Yes. She wanted me to return to the city."

His hands clenched involuntarily.

"I told her," Emily drawled, "if I go, we all go—you and the boys included."

Michael's head snapped up, disbelief written across his face.

"What... what did she say?" His voice trembled. Would her parents, who'd never met him, accept a country son-in-law?

"She said she'd think about it." Emily tilted her head. "Why? Want to meet them?"

Michael shook his head vigorously. "I'll follow your lead."

"Hungry?" Emily changed the subject. "I'll make something."

"Yes! I'll help!" Michael beamed like a child. As long as his wife stood by them, everything would be alright.
###Chapter 246: First Reunion After the Separation

The bitter winter wind howled outside, but it couldn't mask the rich aromas wafting from the Stone family's courtyard. This was their first reunion since the household division, and the atmosphere buzzed with warmth.

"Emily, I heard you made quite a profit in the city?" Patricia Stone sidled up to Emily Johnson, her eyes gleaming with curiosity.

Emily paused while feeding firewood into the stove. She vividly remembered Patricia calling her a "city vixen" during their last altercation.

"What exactly would you like to know, sister-in-law?" Emily lifted her gaze, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Mary Stone slammed her cleaver onto the chopping board. "Patricia, you're here to help, not pry!"

Patricia shrank back and slunk away. Elizabeth Stone swallowed the questions on her tongue.

Outside, Michael Stone supervised the children hanging festive couplets. David stretched on tiptoe to paste the character for "fortune" while Tommy handed him glue.

"Robert, how's your leg?" Michael asked his eldest brother, seated nearby.

"Much better." Robert patted his thigh. "I'll manage the spring planting."

The scent of fried meatballs drifted from the kitchen, making the children salivate. David pulled White Rabbit candies from his pocket, sharing them with his cousins. Richard's eyes lit up as he accepted one.

"Thanks, little brother!" Richard blurted unexpectedly.

At lunch, the round table groaned with dishes—glazed braised pork, fragrant stewed chicken, golden fried twists, and radish meatballs. The children circled hungrily.

"Michael, did well on your trip?" William Stone asked between sips of liquor.

Michael placed chicken in Emily's bowl. "Enough for my wife to eat meat daily next year."

Silence fell. Patricia nearly dropped her chopsticks.

Emily ate delicately. David and Tommy mirrored her refined manners, abandoning their former wolfish haste.

"Putting on city airs..." Patricia muttered until Mary's glare silenced her.

Firecrackers popped outside while warmth filled the house. Michael studied his wife and sons, planning their future. Wherever Emily's university acceptance led, he'd follow.

This New Year carried uncommon warmth.
###Chapter 247: The Soap Incident

At the New Year's Eve family dinner, Emily Johnson couldn't shake the feeling of someone's gaze lingering on her. She looked up and met Patricia Stone's unblinking stare.

"Is something wrong, Patricia?" Emily set down her chopsticks and asked softly.

Patricia quickly averted her eyes and forced a laugh. "You're too thin, Emily. Eat more meat." She plopped a greasy chunk of fatty pork into Emily's bowl.

Emily's brow twitched almost imperceptibly as she eyed the glistening meat. In these times, few could afford to gain weight, but Patricia's sudden concern felt suspicious.

"Thank you, but you should eat more too," Emily replied politely, discreetly pushing the fatty pork aside.

Across the table, Michael Stone noticed his wife's discomfort and wordlessly added some greens to her bowl. Emily flashed him a grateful smile—their silent understanding spoke volumes.

While cleaning up after dinner, Patricia sidled up to Emily, sniffing conspicuously. "What do you use on your face? You smell so nice."

Emily paused mid-task and glanced at her suddenly overly friendly sister-in-law. "Just vanishing cream and soap. Don't you use them?"

"Oh, we country folk can't afford such luxuries," Patricia said, rubbing her hands together, her eyes darting over Emily. "So... could you spare me a bar of that soap?"

Before Emily could respond, Mary Stone slammed a bowl down. "Patricia! Next you'll be asking the Supply & Market to hand over their whole store! Have you no shame?"

Patricia shrank back but persisted. "But Mother, I don't have the coupons—"

"No coupons, just cash," Emily said calmly, wiping her hands. "Last time I bought soap in town without coupons, it was two and a half yuan per—"

"That's robbery!" Patricia gasped, her face twisting. "You're cheating me!"

Elizabeth Stone shook her head in disbelief. Couldn't Patricia read the room, especially on New Year's Eve?

"If it's too expensive, don't buy it," Michael said coldly, stepping forward to wrap an arm around Emily. "Father, Mother, we're heading home."

On their walk back, Michael noticed Emily's silence. "Didn't eat enough?"

Emily shook her head. "I'm fine. I don't eat much."

"Let's go to town tomorrow," he said gently. "They've got sugar-coated haws, popcorn, and your favorite—"

"Any grilled meat?" Emily's eyes sparkled.

Michael blinked, then chuckled. "If you're craving it, we can make our own. There are rabbits in the hills—"

Emily burst out laughing. "I was just teasing. But..." She winked. "If we could have some, that'd be perfect."

They shared a smile, their footprints side by side in the snow. Meanwhile, back at the Stone house, Patricia kicked angrily at the snowdrifts...


###Chapter 248: How Could She Keep Up This Lie?

"No need to go through all that trouble," Emily murmured, her gaze resting on Michael.

Young people always craved hotpot or barbecue every now and then.

"I'll handle it. Let's go home and get everything ready."

The moment they arrived, Michael got to work. Peeling potatoes, skewering bamboo sticks, roasting sweet potatoes—his movements were clumsy but earnest.

Emily leaned against the doorway, watching his awkward efforts with warmth in her heart. The taste didn’t matter; it was the thought that counted.

"Sweetheart, try this." Michael handed her the most perfectly roasted potato skewer.

"Mmm."

David and Tommy stood at a distance, exchanging glances. They had tasted their father’s cooking before—it was barely edible. How could their mother stomach it?

"Shouldn’t we head to the main house now?" Emily glanced at the sky, then pulled out two cans of fruit preserves.

"Keep them for yourselves." Michael frowned. He had wanted to buy New Year’s goods, but Emily had stopped him.

"We still have plenty at home. It’s New Year’s Eve, and there are so many kids today."

Michael didn’t argue further. Carrying the cans, he led his wife and children toward the main house.

"Sister-in-law, any later and the dumplings would’ve been boiled already!" Elizabeth called out loudly.

Emily shot her a glance, washed her hands, and joined in wrapping dumplings.

"I thought Second Sister-in-law would’ve done all of this."

Elizabeth finally understood—this third sister-in-law wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

"What New Year’s gifts did Second Sister-in-law bring for Mom and Dad? I arrived late this morning and didn’t see."

Patricia’s face flushed red. Everyone knew Emily had sent over gifts multiple times.

"Our third daughter-in-law brought so many things—work shoes, oil, meat, dried noodles, sugar, and even fruit!" Mother Stone counted on her fingers.

Elizabeth’s mouth fell open. That much?

"It’s only right to honor our parents," Emily said softly.

Elizabeth and Patricia felt a pang of envy. They wanted to show filial piety too, but they simply couldn’t afford such luxuries.

The dumplings were ready—mostly filled with cabbage and chives, with just a little meat. The family ate together in lively chatter.

After the meal, Michael had Lily bring out bowls and divided the two cans among everyone. Each child got a piece of fruit, and they cheered with delight.

"Canned fruit! It’s canned fruit!"

Orange and bayberry preserves were rare treats in the village. Even the adults were secretly astonished—these two cans must have cost over two yuan.

Emily only ate one bayberry, watching the children’s happy faces.

As night deepened, everyone returned to their own homes.

"Mom, this orange tastes like the little ones you picked for us before," David suddenly said.

Emily’s hand trembled. How did this child remember so well?

Now, how was she supposed to keep up this lie?

Having to sneak around just for a bite to eat—it was frustrating. Since when had she ever felt so guilty over food? Back when she was studying or working, seasonal fruits had never been out of reach.
###Chapter 249: Would His Wife Look Down on His Lack of Education?

"This canned mandarin is from the processing plant," Emily Johnson gently shook the glass jar in her hand. "Fresh fruit is hard to transport, so canning allows it to be sold nationwide."

Michael Stone froze. During his recent business trip, he had passed through many fruit-producing regions. Why hadn't he thought to bring back some fresh fruit?

"Does canning prevent spoilage?" he asked curiously.

"Of course," Emily nodded in explanation. "Fresh fruit lasts at most two weeks, but canned goods can be stored much longer. Otherwise, all the hard work of the fruit growers would go to waste if their produce rotted before being sold."

She counted on her fingers: "Besides fruit preserves, there are also canned fish, canned meat..."

"Mommy knows so much!" Tommy's eyes widened in admiration.

Emily ruffled her son's hair. "Because Mommy loves reading. That's why you two must study hard, understand?"

Michael's heart suddenly skipped a beat.

His wife always encouraged their children to read. Would she... look down on him for being uneducated?

Maybe... he should try for college too?

But what if Emily got accepted and he also went to study—who would take care of their two boys?

Night fell.

Michael heated water for a bath, as Emily wanted to freshen up for the New Year.

"You'll catch a chill," he worried.

"It's fine," she insisted.

Yet when she stepped out of the bathroom, she was shivering violently.

"Get under the blankets!" Michael hastily pulled back the pre-warmed covers, tucking her in securely once she settled.

The bedding was toasty, still carrying his residual warmth.

"Still cold?" he asked upon returning, wrapping his arms around her from behind.

Emily shot him a look. Wasn't it obvious with how tightly he was holding her?

"Should we stay up for the New Year?" she changed the subject.

"Up to you," Michael murmured before suddenly pressing a kiss to her cheek.

"Sweetheart..." His voice dropped lower. "May I?"

Emily froze momentarily.

When realization struck, her entire body stiffened.

She was Michael's wife now—a role she couldn't escape.

Through her nightgown, she could feel the scorching heat of his body.

"I..." She meant to refuse, but Michael's lips captured hers in a deep, urgent kiss that left her dizzy and speechless.

......

The next morning.

Emily stared blankly at the ceiling beams, flashes of last night's passion replaying in her mind.

She covered her face in frustration.

She'd fallen for his charms!

Though... it hadn't been entirely unpleasant?

"Sweetheart, awake?" Michael strode in, looking thoroughly satisfied.

Emily didn't want to move. But it was New Year's Day.

"Getting up now," she forced herself upright, wincing at the soreness in her waist.

"Mommy!" The two boys bounded in cheerfully.

A hot breakfast awaited on the table. Michael's gaze followed her everywhere, his eyes brimming with contentment.

Even while washing up, Emily could feel his burning stare.

A sudden realization struck her—this man who'd gone without for months wouldn't be satisfied so easily.
###Chapter 250: A Fresh Start for the New Year

"Mommy, you look so pretty today!" Little David gazed up at Emily with sparkling eyes.

Emily adjusted her red cashmere coat—a gift from Michael—and gently patted both children's heads. "Thank you, my darlings."

"Daddy said Mommy looks like a fairy princess," little Tommy piped up in his sweet toddler voice, waving his hands excitedly.

Michael stood nearby, a soft smile playing on his lips as he handed each child a candy. "Eat up now. We'll have visitors coming soon for New Year greetings."

Right on cue, Lily arrived with her younger siblings in tow.

"Happy New Year, Uncle Michael and Aunt Emily!" the children chorused, though their eyes kept darting toward the candy dish.

Emily laughed and distributed red envelopes she'd prepared. "Happy New Year! Here you go."

Michael pushed the fruit platter forward. "Take as much as you like."

David tugged at Tommy's hand. "Mommy, can we go greet the neighbors too?"

"Of course, but be careful," Emily said, watching them skip out the door.

Soon, other village children arrived in waves. As Emily handed out sweets, Michael leaned in and whispered, "Just give them the fruit candies."

Spotting Ethan Miller peeking shyly from the doorway, Emily deliberately gave him an extra handful of candy and slipped him a red envelope.

"Thank you, Aunt Emily!" Ethan beamed, his eyes crinkling into happy slits.

When Richard and George Jr. arrived, Emily welcomed them just as warmly.

"Sweetheart, we should head out now," Michael said, straightening his collar.

Nodding, Emily slipped on her leather shoes and walked out arm-in-arm with her husband.

"Is that Emily Johnson?" someone gasped along the way.

"My goodness, I barely recognized her!"

"That coat must've cost a fortune..."

"Those shoes too..."

Whispers followed them like ripples in water. Emily maintained a graceful smile, her arm linked securely with Michael's.

At the Stone family home, Elizabeth Stone gaped at Emily's outfit, then self-consciously tugged at her own homespun cotton jacket.

Mary Stone, however, beamed. "Happy New Year! Come in and sit."

"Mother, we still need to pay respects to the village elders," Michael explained.

John Stone Sr. and his sons were preparing to leave when they spotted Emily. "Our daughter-in-law looks radiant today," the patriarch remarked.

Throughout their rounds, Emily became the center of attention.

"Emily, how is your skin so flawless?" one woman couldn't help asking.

"Vanishing cream," Emily replied politely.

Daniel River sidled up to Michael. "Brother, your wife is stunning today. Those men can't stop staring."

Michael's expression darkened instantly. Glancing back at the cluster of gawking men, he pulled Emily closer and quickened their pace.

"Keep your eyes to yourselves," he muttered under his breath.
###Chapter 251: Michael's Unwavering Possessiveness

Several young men in the village were stealing glances at Emily, but Michael's sharp glare sent them shrinking back.

"After all these years, Michael still guards what's his like a hawk," someone muttered under their breath.

"Exactly. Can't even look at his wife, though she's such a beauty..."

Michael subtly shifted half a step closer to Emily, blocking their gazes completely. Oblivious to her husband's actions, Emily continued chatting with a neighbor.

After New Year greetings, Michael suddenly leaned in. "Sweetheart, let's go to town?"

"What about David and Tommy?" Emily frowned.

"Mom can watch them. It's too crowded today for kids," Michael said, already taking her hand. "Let's go."

"But it's over an hour's walk..."

"I borrowed the village bicycle." Michael's lips curved with smug satisfaction.

Emily studied this suddenly attentive man, recalling last night's intimacy, her ears turning pink. "Well... alright."

The bicycle rolled steadily down the country path. Emily held Michael's waist, breathing in his faint soap scent.

"Hold tight. We'll have fun in town," Michael said, barely containing his excitement.

Meanwhile, two little boys searched the yard for their parents.

"Grandma, where's Mom and Dad?" David asked, looking up.

Mary stuffed candies into their pockets. "They went to town. Next time. Too many people today—play here."

The town market buzzed with activity.

After parking the bicycle, Michael kept firm hold of Emily's hand. "Hungry?"

"I've forgotten what things used to taste like..." Emily admitted hesitantly.

"We'll take our time." Michael pulled her closer. "Don't let go—it's crowded."

Emily's beige cashmere coat stood out strikingly among the drab crowd. Young women eyed her outfit enviously.

"Try this." Michael handed her a triangle cake.

Emily took a small bite, eyes lighting up. "Delicious!"

"Now this." He offered a sugar-coated haws skewer.

Sharing bites, Michael suddenly whispered in her ear, "You're breathtaking."

Emily's face flamed red, nearly spilling her orange soda.

"I—I can't finish this..." She thrust the bottle at him in flustered haste.

Michael drank from where her lips had touched, his Adam's apple bobbing. Emily's pulse raced watching him.

Amid the market's cacophony, Michael felt the world shrink to just the small, soft hand in his.
###Chapter 252: An Unexpected Reunion

Just as Emily Johnson turned to leave the marketplace, Daniel River stepped in front of them.

"Michael, Emily..."

Emily looked up and saw Samuel Bright, Charles Clark, and Daniel River had all come to town.

"Did you just arrive?"

Before she could finish speaking, a familiar female voice rang out: "Peter, I want sugar-coated haws—the extra sour kind."

"Wait here, Daisy. I'll get them for you. Don't wander off."

Charles whirled around, his pupils shrinking. It was Daisy Lee!

Daisy was watching her husband head off to buy the treat when her gaze suddenly locked with Charles'. Her smile froze.

She had known they might meet again—but not this soon.

"Charles, let's check out that stall over there." Daniel threw an arm around Charles' shoulders and forcibly steered him away.

Emily glanced at Daisy's brand-new padded coat. It seemed she was doing well for herself.

"We're heading back. You all take your time." Michael Stone took his wife's hand and quickly walked away. He'd never admit it was because too many people on the street were staring at Emily.

When they got home, David and Tommy were playing in the yard.

"Mommy!" The two boys came running.

Emily handed out the pastries she'd bought, and Mary Stone joined in to sample a few.

——

The second day of the Lunar New Year was traditionally when married women visited their parents.

At the Johnson residence...

Ever since the family discussion about dividing the household, Margaret Johnson had been plotting to bring her daughter back to the city. She couldn't bear to see Emily suffer in the countryside any longer.

The eldest Johnson sister marched straight into the kitchen the moment she arrived. "Mom, I heard Richard and Anthony have split the family assets?"

"They've both started their own families. It was bound to happen sooner or later."

The eldest sister hesitated. "Mom... are you planning to bring Emily back?"

"Country schools can't compare to city ones. Those two grandsons of mine are so bright..."

Her daughter's heart sank. Her parents really did play favorites. When she got married, they'd only given her a little over a hundred, while Emily had received eight hundred.

"Did Victoria tell you that?" Margaret suddenly scoffed. "Well, did she also mention she was the one who secretly signed Emily up for the rural assignment in the first place?"

The eldest sister's eyes widened in shock.
###Chapter 253: The Heartbreaking Truth

"Did Sister-in-law sign Emily up for the re-education program?"

Margaret Johnson's teacup slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor. Scalding tea splashed onto her trousers, but she barely noticed. A chill crept up from her feet, freezing her in place.

That gentle, soft-spoken sister-in-law—had she really stabbed her youngest sister in the back?

"Mom, are you sure?" Margaret's voice trembled. "Sister-in-law always doted on Emily..."

Mrs. Johnson sighed, her eyes glistening with tears. "I checked the records myself at the re-education office. Old Wang, the clerk who handled it back then, remembers. Emily refused to sign, so your sister-in-law signed for her."

Margaret shot to her feet, then collapsed back into her chair. She remembered that summer—Emily's heart-wrenching sobs, the way the whole family dismissed her as spoiled. Now, the truth was clear.

"How is Emily now?"

"That girl is tough," Mrs. Johnson wiped her tears. "She married well—two sons, a brick-tile house. Her husband's a brigade cadre. Though... he's been away recently."

"Private business?" Margaret caught the implication. "With the new policies, the ambitious ones are all leaving."

Mrs. Johnson nodded, then suddenly grasped her eldest daughter's hand. "I want to give my job to Emily."

Margaret's heart clenched. She'd rushed back to work right after childbirth for that position. But now...

"I agree, Mom," she said without hesitation. "Emily's suffered too much."

The memory of her little sister twirling in a floral dress, laughing in the courtyard, flashed before her eyes. A shiver ran down Margaret's spine—had Sister-in-law planned this all along? Sent their pampered youngest into hardship, ruining her life?

"And when our brother insisted on marrying into his wife's family..." Margaret's voice tightened. "Could that have been Sister-in-law's doing too?"

Mrs. Johnson paled. The same suspicion had clearly crossed her mind.

"Emily said she won't abandon her husband and children," Mrs. Johnson murmured. "Ask your husband if his factory needs temporary workers. I heard her husband knows how to drive a tractor."

Margaret nodded firmly. This time, she would protect her sister. But was it too late to make up for all those years of betrayal?
###Chapter 254: What Kind of Mess Is This?

Margaret Johnson rummaged through her drawers and pulled out eight hundred yuan—her secret stash of savings. She planned to use the money to find a job for that son-in-law she couldn't stand.

"Eldest daughter, go ask around for me," Margaret said, stuffing the crumpled bills into her daughter's hand. "If he can drive a tractor, learning to drive a truck shouldn't be too hard."

Emily's elder sister clenched the money, her heart heavy. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll talk to him as soon as I get home."

"Your husband has worked hard."

"We're family. No need for formalities."

By evening, Emily's sister and her family of five had returned home. She immediately told her husband about the plan.

"Your younger sister is already married?" Her husband was surprised—the cheerful girl from his memories still seemed so vivid. "I thought she was still in the countryside."

Emily's sister sighed. "She's been married for years now. Two sons. Mom said it was our sister-in-law who secretly signed her up back then..."

"Sister-in-law?" His eyes widened. "She did that?"

"Mom wanted to give the job to Emily, but Emily refused unless she could bring her husband and kids back to the city." She rubbed her temples. "Even temporary jobs are hard to come by now."

Her husband thought for a moment. "Let's ask around first. With so many educated youths returning to the city, jobs are scarce."

"That's all we can do."

Meanwhile, Margaret had already started cleaning the house. She planned to move her youngest daughter's family in as soon as her eldest daughter and son-in-law moved out.

Emily's sister-in-law was fuming. Right before the New Year, her in-laws were kicking them out—and they hadn't even been assigned a house yet!

"Mom, we'll move as soon as we find a place," she said through gritted teeth.

Margaret didn't even look up, simply hugging her grandson and kissing his cheek. Her indifference toward her daughter-in-law was no longer concealed.

Stone Village

Ever since their first night together, Michael Stone had been pestering his wife every evening.

Emily Johnson couldn't even focus on her books. She glared at him. "I need to study for the college entrance exams. I don't want to get pregnant."

She gave him a pointed look.

Though Michael longed for a daughter, he obediently nodded. The next day, he rode his bicycle to town and returned with a box of contraceptives.

"Sweetheart, it might feel a little uncomfortable," he mumbled, his face red.

Emily nearly choked when she saw the box.

"I meant for you to restrain yourself!" she hissed.

Michael pretended not to understand, leaning in to kiss her. "The grapevines are sprouting. Want to go see?"

"Don't change the subject!" She pushed him away. "What about you? Are you taking the exams too?"

"I'm not smart enough..."

Emily narrowed her eyes. Then, abruptly, she said, "My parents want me to return to the city. What do you think I should do?"
###Chapter 255: The Dirt-Poor Production Brigade

"What?"

Michael Stone was stunned. His wife had never mentioned this before.

"Of course I don't agree."

If his wife returned to the city, how would he and their two sons survive?

"Will you take the exam or not?"

Emily Johnson stared straight at him, her gaze crystal clear: Take it, and they'd remain husband and wife; refuse, and their relationship would need reevaluation.

Michael's heart sank. Ever since his wife lost her memory, she'd changed completely. She'd grown distant, and if not for his persistent efforts, their marriage would have already fallen apart.

"Fine! I'll take the damn exam!"

He gave in. After all, she only said he had to try—not that he had to pass, right?

Emily saw right through him. As long as he was busy studying for the college entrance exam, he wouldn’t have time to bother her.

"Start reviewing now."

What?

Michael's eyes widened. This was way too sudden.

"You studied science, right?"

"Yeah, science."

Emily nodded in satisfaction.

"Focus on math, physics, and chemistry first. Ask me if you don’t understand. We’ll tackle Chinese in June."

The sciences were harder and required early preparation. Chinese was relatively easier—reading comprehension and essays could wait.

"Alright." Michael resigned himself. His wife had everything planned out—what else could he do?

Back then, he had gotten into the county high school, but with all the political movements, he’d barely attended any proper classes. As for worker-peasant-soldier university? Ha! Their brigade was dirt-poor—no way they’d get a quota.

Emily pulled out the Self-Study Series for Math and Science and told him to start with those. He could ask her anytime he got stuck.

She was confident. Though he might not match current high school graduates, getting into a decent university was doable. English wasn’t a concern either—she’d passed Level 6 and used it regularly at work.

For months, she’d been doing one practice test daily, grading them herself. For Chinese, she memorized poems and essays from the textbooks—the exam wouldn’t stray far from the syllabus.

"When do we register?"

"I’ll take you as soon as there’s news."

Since his wife was taking the exam too, he’d made sure to get all the details.

"Okay..."

Once spring arrived, farm work picked up again.

Emily found time to visit the educated youth dormitory to see Olivia Parker.

"Emily? What a surprise!" Olivia was shocked. Emily rarely stepped out of her house.

"Are you taking the exam this year?"

Olivia’s eyes lit up. Was Emily joining them?

"Yes! I’m aiming for a junior college."

"Do you need study materials? I have some here, plus a few practice tests..."

Materials? Tests?

Olivia’s voice trembled with excitement. "Can we copy them?"

With real exam questions, their chances would skyrocket. Sure, the dorm was roomier than home, but who wanted to stay in the countryside forever? Who didn’t want to go back to the city?

"Sure, you and..."

Emily suddenly blanked. What was that male知青’s name again?

"Samuel Bright."

"Then both of you can come to my place to copy them."

Olivia thanked her profusely. "We’re so grateful!"
###Chapter 256: The Temptation of Returning to the City

The morning sunlight streamed through the window as Emily Johnson hung laundry in the yard. Michael Stone walked in, carrying a parcel.

"Emily, there's a package for you," Michael said, handing it to her. "The post office asked me to bring it back when I went to town for fertilizer this morning."

Emily blinked in surprise and examined the address. It was from the provincial capital, sent by "Anthony Johnson."

"It's from my second brother," she murmured.

Michael nodded. "He cares about you."

Emily opened the parcel to find neatly packed candies, biscuits, and a can of mixed fruit. Beneath them lay a piece of blue fabric with white floral patterns—slightly flawed but still a rare treasure in the countryside.

"He must have received the cured meat we sent," Emily said with a smile.

A letter was tucked inside. She unfolded it, her fingers trembling slightly as she recognized the familiar handwriting:

"Dear sister, I hope this letter finds you well."

"After Mother returned from visiting you, the family was in an uproar. Our sister-in-law's scheme to send you to the countryside was exposed, and Father was so furious he announced the division of the family estate on the spot."

Emily's breath hitched. She hadn’t expected the fallout to be so severe.

"Mother saved your dowry—the accounting job promised to you. With policies loosening now, she says she can arrange for you to return to the city if you wish."

Michael, standing beside her, noticed her changing expression.

"What's wrong?" he asked.

Emily handed him the letter. "Read it yourself."

Michael's brow furrowed as he scanned the contents. When he reached the words "can return to the city," his grip tightened unconsciously.

"Do you... want to go back?" His voice was strained.

Emily looked up and saw uncertainty in the eyes of the man who was usually fearless.

"What do you think?" she countered.

Michael swallowed hard. "If you want to go... I—"

"You what?" Emily raised an eyebrow. "Would you really let me leave?"

"No," Michael admitted, gripping her hand. "But I won’t hold you back."

Emily laughed softly. "Silly, didn’t we promise to take the college entrance exam together?"

His eyes brightened. "You’re really staying?"

"Why would I leave?" She pinched his cheek playfully. "The city doesn’t have a man like you."

Michael pulled her into his arms, resting his chin on her head. "I’ll make sure you never regret it."

Leaning against his chest, Emily listened to his steady heartbeat. The offer to return was tempting, but she knew exactly where her future lay.

"Still," she said suddenly, "my brother mentioned many educated youths are returning now, and jobs are scarce."

Michael nodded. "Opportunities are limited."

"That’s why we need to focus on studying," Emily said firmly. "The college entrance exam is our best chance."

Michael squeezed her hand. "We’ll work hard together."

In the distance, children’s laughter drifted over. The couple exchanged a smile as sunlight bathed them in warmth, painting a picture of quiet contentment.
###Chapter 257: Keeping Distance from the Supporting Character's Family

"Aren't you going to work this afternoon?"

Emily raised an eyebrow, her gaze leaving no room for argument.

Michael faltered under her stare and quickly corrected himself, "Of course I am. I'll make lunch first."

Nothing unnerved him more than his wife watching him study with that look.

As he retreated, Emily turned her attention to the package on the table.

Just how much dowry had been sent? Enough to buy a job?

These days, securing employment cost at least four hundred dollars—office jobs were even pricier.

If they cared so much about their daughter, why hadn't they arranged for her return to the city all these years?

Yet if they didn’t care, why send so much money and parcels?

"Mom!"

David and Tommy burst in after school, immediately spotting the new package.

"Uncle sent snacks."

Though the boys never lacked treats, their eyes still lit up with excitement.

"Uncle?"

They'd only met their grandmother—never their uncle.

"Yes, he's a chef. He makes delicious food."

David's eyes sparkled. "Will Uncle like us?"

"Of course."

Emily answered smoothly, though inwardly she preferred keeping her distance from her character's family.

She might have thwarted the sister-in-law's scheme, but a woman who'd maintained such deception for years couldn't be simple.

Better to stay cautious.

Lunch was modest: stir-fried preserved pork with pickled radish, sautéed cabbage, and sweet potato rice.

"Spring's here—any wild greens in the mountains?"

Michael shook his head. "We have vegetables. No need to forage."

"Study first, then go to work."

Emily supervised his revision.

Resigned, Michael picked up his books.

The boys, ever understanding, practiced handwriting and dictionary skills quietly—Emily had already taught them phonics.

"Brother, why so down lately?"

Daniel sidled up to Michael during their afternoon shift.

Had they argued? He hadn’t heard anything.

"Studying."

Daniel blinked.

Studying? For what?

Was his sister-in-law taking college exams? Planning to return to the city?

Had Michael not given her money?

"Sam beat up his cousin."

The incident surprised Daniel.

Sam was easygoing, always smiling—what could have provoked him?

"Oh?"

Michael perked up.

"I asked, but he wouldn’t say."

Sam cherished his grandmother and sister above all.

"Leave it be, then."

Daniel scratched his head. "I’m just curious what that cousin did. Stranger still—his uncle and aunt didn’t even make a scene."

Given that family's temper, they should’ve kicked up a storm.

"And Old Thomas got sentenced to manure duty."

Clearly, much had happened in their absence.
###Chapter 258: The Seed Scandal

Spring plowing season arrived, and the entire brigade was bustling with activity.

The wheat fields needed their final round of fertilization, and the ridges required repair. Two old oxen plowed the fields from dawn till dusk, but it still wasn't enough. The commune members had no choice but to roll up their sleeves and work the land themselves.

"Did we get the corn and rice seeds for this year?" Emily Johnson asked suddenly while sorting vegetables.

Michael Stone looked up from sharpening his sickle. "The town arranged a bulk purchase. Each brigade will receive their seeds in a couple of days."

Emily thought of the sweet, sticky corn she had tasted in her past life and swallowed hard. Unfortunately, their private plot was too small—most of it had to be reserved for vegetables.

"Don't worry about the seeds," Michael reassured her.

What Emily really wanted to say was that she had better hybrid seeds in her space. But those seeds couldn't be saved for replanting, and bringing them out recklessly would only raise suspicion.

Early that morning, Brigade Leader John Stone Sr. and Michael headed to town to collect the seeds. The moment their tractor left the commune yard, the older man sensed something was wrong.

"Stop!" He slapped his son's shoulder abruptly.

Michael slammed on the brakes, nearly sending the seed bags in the trailer flying.

"What's wrong, Dad?"

John's face darkened as he jumped down and tore open one of the sacks. His rough fingers sifted through the grains, examining them under the sunlight.

"These seeds aren't right!"

Just then, Brigade Leader Richard Lopez from the neighboring brigade drove past on his tractor and stopped. "John, why'd you stop?"

"There's a problem with the seeds," John said grimly.

Richard's expression changed instantly. He rushed over, grabbed a handful of seeds, and his face grew increasingly grim.

"Let's go to the county!"

"Wait." Michael stopped the two older men. "We should check with Secretary Ren first."

The three carried a sack of seeds straight to the secretary's office but were blocked by the guard.

"The secretary is in a meeting. Come back tomorrow!"

"This is about spring plowing—we can't delay!" John raised his voice.

The office door suddenly swung open, and Secretary Ren stepped out with a frown. "What's all this noise?"

Recognizing them, his expression softened slightly. "Come in."

They dumped the seed bag on the floor. The moment Secretary Ren saw it, his face changed.

"Xiao Fang!" he barked.

A bespectacled young man rushed in nervously, his gaze lingering on the seed bag for a split second.

"Get Director Lin here!"

Soon, a middle-aged man with a beer belly sauntered in. When he spotted the seed bag, his eyes flickered.

"You wanted to see me, Secretary?"

Secretary Ren pointed at the seeds. "Explain this."

Director Lin picked up a handful with feigned nonchalance. "Same as every year. Nothing wrong."

"Bullshit!" Richard couldn't hold back. "You call these shriveled grains viable?"

The air in the office froze. Secretary Ren's face turned thunderous.
###Chapter 259: The Looming Seed Crisis

"Secretary Ren, this really isn't my fault!" Director Lin wiped sweat from his brow, his voice trembling. "Every year, our town's seeds are allocated by the county seed company. Who knew this year they'd suddenly—"

"The county seed company?" Secretary Ren frowned, tapping his fingers on the desk. "Call them immediately and find out what's going on."

Director Lin rushed to make the call. Moments later, he returned pale-faced.

"Secretary, they said... there were quality issues with this year's seeds due to last year's disaster..." His voice trailed off. "What do we do now? We can't delay spring planting!"

Thud! Secretary Ren slammed his hand on the desk. "And they're only telling us now? Every brigade is waiting to sow!"

He took a deep breath, forcing down his anger. "Go home for today. I'll handle this personally tomorrow."

"But what about this batch of seeds—"

"Unload them!" Secretary Ren gritted his teeth. "Not a single grain stays!"

By the time Brigade Leader John Stone and his son Michael drove their empty tractor back to the village, night had fallen.

"Dad, something's not right," Michael said, gripping the steering wheel. "If this isn't resolved by tomorrow, we'll have to buy seeds from another province."

John nodded grimly. "Hundreds of families are counting on this harvest."

At home, Emily Johnson was reading under the kerosene lamp.

"Did you get the seeds?" she asked, looking up.

Michael shook his head. "There was a problem."

"Poor quality?" Emily immediately sensed the gravity of the situation.

Michael's eyes widened as he grabbed her hand. "How did you know?"

"A guess," she said softly. "If it were minor, you wouldn't have come back empty-handed."

His chest tightened. She was right—those seeds were definitely unusable.

"If the whole county is affected..." Emily hesitated.

"Then we'll buy from another province!" Michael said firmly. "We'll sell everything if we have to, but we will get seeds."

Before dawn the next day, father and son set out again.

The town's response crushed their hopes.

"To the county seat!" John said decisively.

But after scouring every seed station, they secured only a hundred pounds of corn seeds.

"Michael, we need to try neighboring counties," John said hoarsely. "Any later, and it'll be too late..."

The tractor jolted along dirt roads as they searched nearby towns, gathering only scraps of leftover seeds.

As night fell again, Emily stood at the gate, wringing her hands.

"Why aren't they back yet...?" She bit her lip, mentally calculating the supplies in her secret space.

If all else failed... she'd have to take the risk.
###Chapter 260: Emily's Seed Experiment

The kerosene lamp cast flickering golden light on the windowsill. Emily glanced at the wall clock for the third time. The hands pointed to eleven. Rubbing her tired eyes, she turned another page of the agricultural manual.

A rustling sound came from outside the courtyard wall. Michael Stone vaulted over quietly, not wanting to disturb his wife. But seeing the light still glowing through the window, warmth spread through his chest.

"Sweetheart, I'm home."

Emily hurried to open the door. The night breeze carried the scent of damp earth as Michael stepped inside, his trousers flecked with mud.

"About the seeds..."

"Seven villages, and this is all I could find." Michael pulled a cloth bundle from his coat. The handful of rice seeds inside looked pitifully sparse.

Emily took the bundle, fingertips brushing the shriveled grains. "Maybe we could try last year's harvest?"

Michael frowned. Last year's yield had been poor, the remaining grains uneven in quality. But now...

"Let me heat some food for you." Emily turned toward the kitchen, but Michael caught her wrist.

"Don't bother." He noticed the faint shadows under her eyes. "You've been working too hard."

Emily's eyes suddenly brightened. "I've been reading agricultural books. Maybe we could attempt seed cultivation."

"Cultivation?" Michael stared. Since when did his city-bred wife know about farming?

"Temperature control, soaking duration—it's all precise." She flipped open the book, pointing at diagrams. "If we can improve the germination rate..."

Michael hesitated, but seeing her determined profile, he nodded. "I'll speak with Father tomorrow."

At dawn, after hearing his son's proposal, Senior John Stone studied the dog-eared manual for a long moment.

"Twenty pounds. No more." The old team leader sighed. "If this actually works..."

Emily accepted the rice grains like treasure. Once the household emptied, she sprang into action—warm water soaking, nutrient solutions, timed stirring—each step executed with textbook precision.

Three mornings later, Emily lifted the cotton cloth covering the wooden barrel and gasped.

Tiny white sprouts peeked from the grains, crowding the barrel's bottom in thick clusters.

"How...?" Michael rushed over at her call, eyes widening. Normally germination took seven days, yet here...

Emily smiled faintly. "The book says proper temperature and humidity can double the speed."

News spread through the production team like wildfire. Gloom lifted as villagers gathered around the miraculous sprouts, murmuring in awe.

"Emily's a miracle worker!"
"We're saved..."
"Quick, see the seedlings Mrs. Stone cultivated..."

Senior John stood at the crowd's edge, watching his daughter-in-law demonstrate techniques to the encircled villagers. He discreetly wiped his eyes. This city girl might just lead them through their darkest hour.
###Chapter 261: It's All the Sister-in-Law's Fault

Michael Stone didn't send David to fetch his father. Instead, he went personally to bring John Stone Sr. over.

"Dad, come take a look," Michael urged, his voice tinged with urgency.

John's eyes lit up when he saw the tender sprouts emerging from the rice seeds. Carefully cradling a handful, his fingers trembled slightly. "They've really germinated... We can plant these..."

"We'll start tomorrow!" John declared decisively. "But this isn't enough. We need to cultivate more seedlings."

Clutching the sprouted seeds, he hurried to the brigade office and called an emergency meeting with all the cadres.

"Look, last year's rice harvest has an excellent germination rate," John announced, placing the seeds on the table. "We're still short fifty pounds of rice seeds and a hundred pounds of corn seeds."

The room buzzed with excitement. In previous years, they'd had to spend money on new seeds because their saved seeds had such poor germination rates.

"Emily Johnson was in charge of the seedlings this time," John suddenly added.

"Emily?" Helen Carter, the women's director, widened her eyes in surprise. "She knows how to do this?"

"She's read many agricultural books," John explained. "I think we should let her continue overseeing this and credit her with work points."

Everyone nodded in agreement.

When Emily received the assignment, she sighed helplessly. She had no choice but to proceed, following the same steps to cultivate more seedlings.

Before she could finish, Richard Lopez, the brigade leader from the neighboring village, came knocking.

"Emily..." Richard rubbed his hands together, his face lined with worry. "We're short on seeds, and I heard you've found a solution..."

Meeting his hopeful gaze, Emily thought for a moment. "I can prepare a germination solution for you. It's something I developed through experimentation."

"Really?" Richard's eyes brightened. "That's wonderful!"

"This bottle can treat five hundred pounds of seeds," Emily handed him a small glass vial. "They should sprout in two or three days."

Just as Richard was about to thank her, Michael interjected, "Uncle Richard, this solution took a lot of effort to make. It'll cost ten dollars."

"Of course, of course!" Richard readily pulled out the money and left, cradling the vial like a treasure.

Once the breeding work was done, Emily could finally focus on her studies. Every day, she prepared practice questions for Michael. Olivia Parker and another educated youth often came by to copy test papers or ask for help.

Life seemed to settle into a peaceful rhythm.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted in the Johnson household back in the city.

After moving out, Victoria Johnson and her husband squeezed into a cramped rental apartment. Having grown accustomed to the spacious Johnson family home, the four of them now lived in just two rooms, making even private moments difficult.

What infuriated Victoria even more was that her husband's promotion had fallen through—another colleague had snatched the position.

"It's all your precious sister's fault!" Victoria hissed through gritted teeth. "If she had just helped, you wouldn't have lost out!"

She slammed a rag into the washbasin, sending water splashing everywhere.
###Chapter 262: Knowledge Changes Destiny

"If only that wretched girl hadn't gone to the countryside..." Margaret Wilson clenched the rag in her hand, her knuckles turning white. She stared at the sycamore tree outside the window, her eyes dark with resentment.

The shrill whistle of the kettle in the kitchen startled her.

"That ungrateful brat better never come back!" she spat viciously, throwing the rag into the basin and splashing water everywhere.

Meanwhile, in the fields at the foot of the mountain.

"Achoo—" Emily Johnson rubbed her itchy nose as dappled sunlight filtered through the leaves onto her face.

"Mommy, are you sick?" Little Tommy stretched on his tiptoes, trying to touch her forehead, his small face full of concern.

"I'm fine." She chuckled, pinching his chubby cheeks. "Let's keep looking for mugwort. Mommy will make you some sweet rice cakes."

The spring breeze carried the scent of fresh earth as it swept across the fields. Emily squinted against the sunlight, suddenly remembering the soft, fragrant rice cakes her grandmother had made in her past life—the taste still lingering on her tongue.

"Mommy, mushrooms only come after the rain!" David crouched in the grass, carefully searching the undergrowth.

"Silly boy, Mommy's looking for mugwort." She laughed, brushing the dirt from his face.

The next morning, Emily rode her bicycle to town to pick up a package. An old ox plodded along the ridge, the air thick with the mingled scents of grass and manure.

Behind the post office counter, Mrs. Wang smiled as she handed over the parcel. "Another package from your family, Emily?"

"Yes." Emily took the heavy package, her fingers brushing against the rough brown paper. She bought half a pound of pork belly and a couple of ounces of fruit candy before heading back.

By noon, the aroma of braised pork filled the house.

"So you're really going to take the exam again?" Mary Stone asked suddenly, setting her chopsticks down with a light clink against the bowl.

Emily ladled soup into her mother-in-law's bowl. "Mother, there's no harm in furthering one's education." Her gaze drifted to the rice sprouts drying outside, their tender green shoots stretching toward the sunlight. "Look at those seeds..."

Mary fell silent. It was true—since adopting Emily's method, their rice germination rate had increased by thirty percent.

"If you pass," the older woman lowered her voice, "I'll take care of David and Tommy."

Emily paused mid-bite. Was her mother-in-law... actually supporting her?

That afternoon, she opened the letter from home alone. The handwriting was neat, almost rigid:

[We're arranging work for you. Your husband's tractor skills are an advantage...]

Her eyes lingered on the words "separate households." The proud sister-in-law she remembered had actually been kicked out of the family home?

The pen scratched against the paper as she wrote:

[Mom and Dad, Michael and I have discussed...]

After finishing the last sentence, she pulled out a math test and walked toward Michael, who was chopping firewood.

"Pop quiz." She waved the paper, its whiteness glaring in the sunlight.

The man froze mid-motion, sweat still on his brow.

"Bro, why do you look like a wilted eggplant?" Daniel River leaned on his hoe, eyeing him suspiciously. "Don't tell me..." His gaze flicked toward the house.

Michael sighed deeply, clutching the test paper like a man marching to his doom.
###Chapter 263: Wheat Harvest Season

"Michael, your dark circles are practically hanging down to your chin!" Daniel River teased as soon as he saw Michael Stone.

Michael rubbed his tired eyes and shot him an annoyed glare. "Mind your own business."

"Could it be that Emily won't let you sleep?" Daniel waggled his eyebrows suggestively.

Before he could finish, Michael smacked the back of his head. "Don't talk nonsense!"

"Ow!" Daniel clutched his head. "Michael, you hit way too hard. Looks like Emily needs to make you some tonics."

"Tonics? Nonsense!" Michael's ears turned slightly red. "I just... stayed up late studying."

Daniel smirked, clearly unconvinced. Everyone knew Michael had been under Emily's strict supervision lately, with barely any time for intimacy.

"Fine, fine. I'm the one who needs tonics. I'm the weak one," Daniel quickly backtracked.

The May sun blazed overhead, turning the wheat fields golden. Despite preparing for his college entrance exams, Michael still had to help with the harvest—farm work couldn't wait.

"Emily, you don’t need to come," Michael said, watching her approach with a food basket, concern in his voice.

Emily adjusted her straw hat. "I’ll just bring you lunch and leave."

The rich aroma of braised pork wafted from the basket, making nearby workers swallow hard in envy.

"Patricia, your sister-in-law’s family is eating meat again," someone remarked sourly.

Patricia Stone chewed on her dry flatbread, bitterness rising in her throat. Ever since Michael married this city girl, their lives had improved dramatically—even meat had become a regular meal.

"Eat quickly before it gets cold," Emily said, setting out the dishes and pouring everyone a cup of iced tea.

Michael took a bite of the braised pork and closed his eyes in satisfaction. "Your cooking keeps getting better."

"Stop flattering me," Emily blushed. "I’ll go make mung bean soup and have David bring it later."

Mary Stone shook her head at the couple’s affectionate display. "How many years has it been since they married? Still acting like newlyweds."

On her way back, Emily mentally planned what nourishing dishes to make for Michael that evening. Though he wouldn’t admit it, the relentless cycle of studying and farm work had visibly worn him down.

"Mom!" David and Tommy called out, their small baskets filled with gleaned wheat stalks as they played along the field’s edge.

Emily ruffled their hair. "How much did you collect?"

"Lots!" Tommy proudly held up his basket. "We can make flatbread tonight!"

Looking at their rosy cheeks, Emily suddenly felt that despite the hardships, this life was deeply fulfilling and warm.
###Chapter 264: The Wheat Harvest Rush

Golden wheat fields swayed in the breeze—it was the perfect time for harvest. If they didn’t act fast, a single rain could ruin the crop, causing the wheat to sprout.

At the crack of dawn, the villagers headed to the fields with sickles in hand. They worked until sunset, earning their full work points, with the strongest laborers even securing fifteen.

Emily Johnson stayed home to prepare meals for her two boys before hurrying to the kitchen. She brewed mung bean soup with rock sugar, then cooled it in a well bucket.

"Mom, we’re going to gather wheat ears!" David and Tommy called out as they finished washing the dishes, grabbing small baskets before dashing off to the fields.

Once the soup was chilled, Emily carried it to the workers. She made sure to share it not just with her own family but also with her brothers-in-law and their wives.

"Sis, this soup is delicious!" Daniel River gulped down half a bowl, wiping his mouth with a grin.

"I also made mint water—perfect for beating the heat." Emily pointed to the freshly washed mint leaves. "There’s plenty for everyone."

The other villagers watched enviously. Though Emily didn’t work in the fields, her family often sent supplies, her cooking was exceptional, and now she was generous enough to share homemade refreshments.

The moment the harvest ended, a downpour began.

"Good thing we finished in time," Michael Stone said, wiping sweat from his brow. "Tomorrow, I’ll go up the mountain to pick mushrooms for you."

Emily glanced at the two grapevines in their yard. Though they bore only a few clusters, Michael had carefully built trellises for them.

"Make sure they’re chicken mushrooms..."

"I remember."

The rain came fast, leaving the fields waterlogged. As soon as the skies cleared, Michael hiked up the mountain with a bamboo basket, returning with a full load of chicken mushrooms. They dried the excess and made a fragrant mushroom paste.

Soon, another busy farming season arrived—planting corn and transplanting rice seedlings left no time to rest.

"Your exams are coming up. Shouldn’t you take time off to study?" Emily asked as she watched her husband wolf down his meal.

"No need," Michael mumbled between bites. "I’ll work during the day and study at night."

As the heat intensified, Emily avoided trips to town for meat. Instead, she bought a free-range chicken and some eggs from Daisy Miller. Every day without fail, she prepared malt extract and powdered milk for the family.

Running into Amy Bright reminded Emily that the original abduction plot had been altered. Fate, it seemed, wasn’t set in stone.

While transplanting rice, Michael caught several loaches and eels. Too squeamish to handle them herself, Emily left the task to him. She invited her in-laws over for a special meal, though she couldn’t bring herself to take a single bite.

After delivering the agricultural tax, the team distributed the new grain.

"Are these sweet potato vines really edible?" Michael eyed the plants in their yard skeptically. With plenty of vegetables at home, he couldn’t understand why his wife insisted on growing them.

"You seemed to enjoy them last time," Emily teased, plucking a tender shoot. "Changed your mind?"
###Chapter 265: The Return to the City

"Sweetheart, this stir-fried sweet potato vine is delicious," Michael said, taking a bite but keeping his eyes fixed on Emily.

Emily rolled her eyes. "Eat it or don’t. It’s good for you."

The two little boys, David and Tommy, were happily digging into the dish, their chopsticks clashing over the last bites.

"The college entrance exams are next month. You need to focus on math, physics, and chemistry," Michael said seriously, setting down his chopsticks.

"Yeah, yeah," Emily replied absentmindedly, her thoughts clearly elsewhere.

Suddenly, Michael leaned in close, lowering his voice. "Sweetheart, I was thinking—"

"Don’t even think about it!" Emily shoved him away. "You’re finishing this set of practice problems tonight!"

Michael pouted like a scolded puppy.

But when night fell and the house grew quiet, Emily still couldn’t escape his "clutches."

In the Johnson family’s living room, Margaret clapped her hands in delight as she read the telegram. "Finally, a job! They need to come back right away!"

Henry frowned. "Do you really think that boy will agree?"

"What kind of question is that?" Margaret glared at him. "Are you suggesting they should live apart?"

"I’m just worried—" Henry hesitated. In their community, men who married rural women were always the subject of gossip.

Margaret scoffed. "Is your pride more important than your daughter?"

The next day, the mailman’s booming voice echoed outside the courtyard. "Emily Johnson, telegram!"

Emily tore it open, her brow furrowing instantly.

"What’s wrong?" Michael asked, wiping sweat from his forehead as he returned from the fields.

"My mother says she found a job for us. She wants us to come back to the city." Emily handed him the telegram.

Michael read it in silence. "The exams are coming up..."

"I’ll send a reply tomorrow," Emily muttered, rubbing her temples in frustration.

The timing couldn’t have been worse.

When the Johnsons received Emily’s response, Henry nearly jumped out of his seat. "The college entrance exams? Have they lost their minds?"

"What’s wrong with taking the exams?" Margaret shot back. "If he gets into university, who’d dare laugh then?"

Henry opened his mouth but swallowed his words.

If that country boy actually got into college, where would that leave his pride?
###Chapter 266: The Choice Before College Entrance Exams

Margaret Johnson frowned slightly, her fingers tapping lightly on the table. "If she gets accepted, why would she need a temporary job?"

The room fell silent.

"What if..." Henry Johnson hesitated, "...neither of them gets in?"

"Does David's father have schooling too?" Henry suddenly remembered.

"High school graduate," Margaret replied calmly. "Same as Emily."

Henry's heart sank. Raising a high school graduate in the countryside was no easy feat.

"Let's wait and see," he finally said.

Margaret turned and headed to the Supply & Market. Since the family had split, their finances had improved. She bought two cans of malt extract and some extra groceries, mailing them out the same day.

The June sun blazed mercilessly.

Emily Johnson received the package on the day the brigade took its farming break. The post office was crowded with educated youths picking up letters. Clutching the heavy parcel, warmth spread through her chest.

The town's Supply & Market had just stocked bananas and peaches. She bought two pounds and discreetly took out a slab of pork belly from her hidden stash.

At lunch, Michael Stone suddenly set down his chopsticks.

"Dad, I'm taking the college entrance exams."

John Stone Sr. nearly dropped his bowl.

"You?" His eyes widened. "I thought it was Emily who was taking them?"

"We both registered," Michael said firmly.

The brigade leader's expression shifted several times. "Are you confident?"

"Emily has a better chance," Michael admitted honestly.

"What if..." John swallowed hard, "...what if she gets in and you don't?"

Lately, he'd heard too many stories of educated youths divorcing after one got into university.

"I'll go with her as a companion student," Michael stated resolutely.

John let out a heavy sigh. Glancing at his daughter-in-law quietly eating, he lowered his voice. "Actually... didn't your mother-in-law find you a temporary job?"

Michael nodded. "I turned it down."

John was stunned. His in-laws actually approved of this son-in-law? Jobs in the city were nearly impossible to come by these days!

Studying his son's determined profile, he suddenly found it unfamiliar.

When had his troublesome third son, who'd caused him so much worry, grown so decisive?

"If you've made up your mind..." John shoveled a mouthful of rice, "...your mother can help watch the children."

Outside, cicadas screamed relentlessly. The midsummer sunlight filtered through the window lattice, casting dappled shadows across the dining table.

Beneath it, Emily quietly reached for her husband's hand.
###Chapter 267: A Terrifying Moment

"Michael, did your mother-in-law really find you a job?" Mary Stone eyed her youngest son with suspicion.

Last time the in-laws visited, they'd been so cold. What could have changed their minds so suddenly?

Michael rubbed his hands together, his dark face breaking into a grin. "It's true, Ma. But Emily said if I return to the city, I have to take David and Tommy with me."

"Is that so?" John Stone Sr. frowned around the pipe clenched between his teeth. "First, go check if there are any changes to this year's college entrance exam policies."

Amy Bright was hanging laundry in the yard when she heard Emily's voice call from next door.

"Amy, I'm going to town tomorrow. Want to come along?"

Wiping her hands, Amy recalled Emily's warning from their last conversation. After spring planting, the household did need supplies.

"I don't think I can make it..." she hesitated. "Be careful if you go alone."

Emily emerged with two small cloth bundles. "These are undershirts my mother sent. They're too small for me—you can have them."

Amy's face flushed crimson. She accepted the soft cotton, fingertips brushing against the thin padding inside.

"These...must have cost a fortune."

"Hardly worth mentioning." Emily waved her off. "If you feel bad, just gather some mushrooms for me sometime."

At dawn the next day, Amy hitched a ride to town on an oxcart. The village women chattered nonstop, baskets of eggs bouncing on their laps.

The Supply & Market swarmed with people. After waiting in endless lines, Amy finally secured oil, salt, vinegar, and soy sauce. As she stepped outside with her net bag, a cry rang out.

An elderly woman with silver hair lay sprawled at the foot of the steps.

"Dear, help me up..." The woman's gnarled hand trembled as she reached out.

Amy rushed forward. The woman's bony wrist dug painfully into her palm.

"Thank you..." The woman panted. "My house is just down that alley. Could you—"

An alley? Amy's stomach lurched. Emily's warning exploded in her ears: "Human traffickers always use children or elderly as bait."

"Sorry, Grandma! My village cart is waiting!" She wrenched free and sprinted away without looking back.

Rounding the corner, she glimpsed two hulking figures lurking in the alleyway. Her heart hammered like a drum, sweat drenching her back in an instant.

She never saw how the "grandmother" sprang up effortlessly the moment she fled, spitting toward the alley. "Another one got away!"

###Chapter 268: Bitter Regret

The moment Amy Bright left, the frail-looking old woman instantly transformed, her voice strong and clear as she cursed, "That little brat is sharper than I thought."

Had Amy known the truth, she would have broken out in a cold sweat.

"Has anyone seen my grandson?" the old woman suddenly shrieked.

The crowd waiting for the bus exchanged uneasy glances.

"The child is missing?"

The old woman clutched her chest, tears streaming down her wrinkled face. "I only went to buy soy sauce, and when I turned around, he was gone!"

Amy's heart lurched. There really were kidnappers in town—she had nearly fallen into their trap.

"Report it to the police station!" someone urged. "Didn't Emily say last year that if you encounter kidnappers, you must report it immediately? If you wait, the child might never be found!"

Several women gasped. Back then, they had thought Emily was exaggerating.

"Yes, yes, go find the police!"

"We'll help too!"

The small police station was soon flooded with over a dozen people. The officer on duty quickly organized a search party.

"It's getting dark. We should head back to the village."

"Mrs. Zhang, we're leaving now."

Mrs. Zhang collapsed onto a bench, her voice hoarse. "Tell my ungrateful sons..."

Regret gnawed at her. She never should have given in and brought her grandson to town.

On the way back, the women couldn't stop talking.

"Emily was right—there really are kidnappers!"

"You can't just let a child have their way when they beg to go to town."

"Mrs. Zhang must be sick with regret."

"Her youngest son and his wife will never forgive her."

Amy's heart pounded. If she hadn't remembered Emily's warning, she might have been the one missing.

As soon as the ox-cart reached the village, she sprinted straight to Emily's house.

"Emily! Emily!"

Emily had just finished handing out jelly to the two boys when she heard the urgent shouts outside.

"Keep doing your homework," she told the children before going to open the door.

Amy rushed into the yard, her face pale. "Emily, Mrs. Zhang—the one who went to town with me today—her grandson was kidnapped!"

The two boys looked up from their writing.

"Who was taken?"

"Tutu!" Amy cried.

David gasped. "Mom, that's the chubby kid who always follows me around calling me 'boss'!"

Tommy remembered too. "He came to our house asking for candy!"

Emily pictured a round-faced little boy who would sweetly call her "Auntie" and refuse to leave without a treat.

"If he was really kidnapped..." Her brow furrowed. "It might be a long time before he's found."
###Chapter 269: The Traffickers' New Scheme

Emily Johnson furrowed her brows, her fingers unconsciously tapping the table. She knew all too well the tactics of human traffickers—once the golden window for rescue passed, the chances of finding the missing child dwindled rapidly.

"Auntie, the police have already filed the case," Amy Bright said naively, believing that reporting to the authorities would solve everything.

"Too late," Emily shook her head. "This town only has a few roads. They should've blocked all exits immediately and conducted a thorough search. Now..." She left the sentence unfinished, but the implication was clear.

Amy suddenly paled as a memory struck her. "I met an old woman today who insisted I walk her home..."

Emily shot to her feet, knocking over her teacup. She had assumed the traffickers had gone quiet, but they had simply changed tactics.

"You did the right thing," she said, suppressing her anger. "These traffickers use the elderly, children, even pregnant women as decoys to lure victims to isolated areas."

Amy trembled as the realization hit her—she had nearly fallen into their trap.

"That's terrifying..."

"Remember, the friendlier they seem, the more cautious you should be."

Meanwhile, the village was in an uproar. Old Mrs. Zhang's sons stormed into the brigade office with bloodshot eyes. The roar of tractors filled the air as a group of men sped toward town.

Michael Stone and Brigade Leader John Stone Sr. were among them.

News spread like wildfire. Every household kept their children under close watch, fearing they might be next.

When Mary Stone arrived, Amy had just left.

"Michael went to town with your father. No telling when they'll be back."

"Mom, stay for dinner?" Emily offered a bowl of bayberries. "Picked them yesterday. Soaked in saltwater."

Mary waved her off, grabbing a handful as she headed out. "Got soup simmering at home."

The search in town wasn't going well.

"Dad, these traffickers are getting bolder!" Robert Stone gritted his teeth.

John Sr. scoffed. "Last year, your wife almost got snatched off the street, and you all turned a blind eye!"

Michael quietly broke away from the group, slipping into a shadowed alley. The midday air was thick with the scent of cooking, but something else caught his attention—an off smell.

"Third Brother, that's the house," the informant whispered, pointing.

Michael held his breath as he crept closer. Muffled voices drifted from inside:

"Boss, the cops are searching."

"We move them at nightfall."

His pupils constricted, fists clenching until his knuckles cracked.
###Chapter 270: A Close Call

Michael Stone crouched by the wall, pretending to tie his shoelaces while straining his ears. The sound of a child's muffled sobs from the alley made his chest tighten.

"What are you doing here, sir?"

A woman's voice startled him from behind. Michael whipped his head around to see a heavily pregnant woman eyeing him warily, a bottle of soy sauce in her hand and beads of sweat on her forehead.

"Just passing through," Michael muttered, tugging his cap lower over his face.

Margaret Lee narrowed her eyes. She recognized him—last year at the community meeting, she'd seen him beat a local troublemaker to a pulp. The memory still sent chills down her spine.

"This is my doorstep," Margaret said, straightening her posture. "Who are you looking for?"

Michael finally noticed her swollen belly. A flash of recognition hit him—wasn't she Charles Clark's ex? The girl who'd jumped into the river over a dowry dispute.

"Wrong house," he forced a chuckle before turning away. His vest clung to his back, soaked with sweat.

Margaret watched him leave, suspicion gnawing at her. Something felt off. She touched her stomach and hurried inside.

Three hours later.

"Found them! In the cellar!" An officer's shout shattered the silence.

An elderly woman clutched her grandson, weeping uncontrollably. The chubby boy, his face still sticky with candy, buried himself in her arms.

"My sweet boy..."

Michael wiped his brow, exhaling in relief as three children and a young woman were led out to safety.

"Wrap it up!"

By the time he got home, it was past two in the afternoon. Emily Johnson was hanging laundry in the yard and quickly set down the clothesline when she saw him.

"Starving, aren't you?" She dashed into the kitchen. "I saved you some jelly noodles."

Michael collapsed into a bamboo chair, gulping down half a pitcher of iced tea. Emily brought out the chilled dish, fanning him gently as he devoured it.

"Did you find them all?"

"Yeah." He swallowed another bite. "Three kids and a young woman hidden in the cellar."

Emily's face suddenly paled. "Was there an old woman too?"

Michael froze mid-bite. "How did you know?"

"Amy almost—" Emily lowered her voice, recounting Amy Bright's near-miss.

Michael's bowl nearly slipped from his grasp. He shot to his feet before forcing himself back down.

"Three suspects," he said tightly. "An old woman, a middle-aged man, and a young guy."

Emily clenched her fists. "We have to follow the trail and take down this trafficking ring for good."

Outside, cicadas screeched under the scorching June sun. Watching the worry etched on his wife's face, Michael silently vowed to protect their family at all costs.
###Chapter 271: Countdown to College Entrance Exams

"Let the police handle this. They're locals—everyone here has children. They despise kidnappers the most."

Let's hope so.

The matter was finally settled.

Little Tuwa was thoroughly frightened and didn't dare leave the house for days. Even when he did, he clung to his father's sleeve, no longer running off recklessly.

The chubby boy, however, proved resilient and didn't fall ill from the scare.

Grandma Zhang, on the other hand, developed a high fever the day after returning. The village doctor prescribed medicine, and though the fever subsided, the elderly woman remained bedridden for several days before recovering.

"Emily, I really think I can pass this time!" Olivia declared with confidence.

In her eyes, Emily seemed omniscient.

She couldn't understand how someone as capable as Emily had failed the exams twice.

"This year's exams will likely be tougher than those in '77 and '78, but based on your practice tests, getting into college shouldn't be a problem."

Olivia and Sophia exchanged glances.

They had decided to take the exams again.

"Let's do our best!"

Before the exams, all candidates had to collect their admission tickets at the town's high school.

This year's exams were scheduled for July 7th to 9th.

In early July, Michael took time off from work. Olivia and Sophia often came over to study together.

Mary took her two grandsons to stay with her, ensuring the young couple could focus on their preparations.

David and Tommy were remarkably well-behaved, never causing a fuss, knowing their parents were studying for the exams. They played with the village children but never neglected their writing practice. Mary couldn't read, but John Sr. checked the boys' homework.

One noon, Daniel rushed over after finishing his shift.

"Michael, are you sick?"

Michael looked baffled.

"I'm fine."

Daniel scrutinized him, even more confused. "Then why aren't you working today?"

His brother never missed work unless absolutely necessary. Not seeing him all morning had been worrying.

"I'm taking the college entrance exams."

What?

The exams?

Daniel's jaw nearly hit the floor.

He never expected his brother would accompany his wife to take the exams!

Michael raised an eyebrow at his stunned expression. "What, can't I?"

The sudden sharp tone made Daniel jump.

"Of course you can!"

Absolutely.

After all, Michael had graduated high school.

Seeing his younger brother calm down, Michael softened his tone. "Don't mention this to anyone."

He wasn't entirely confident he'd pass.

"Not a word, I promise!"

His brother probably just wanted to try. Passing would be great, but failing wouldn't be a big deal.

"Aren't you going home for lunch?"

Lunch?

Daniel eyed the leftovers on the table: scrambled eggs with cucumber, dry-fried green beans, and tomato egg soup.

"Michael, mind if I eat here? I'll clean up afterward!"

"Fine, if you don't mind."

Mind?

Daniel quickly served himself and sat down.

"Go study. I'll handle the dishes."

"Mm."

Michael turned and went back to his room, burying himself in his books again.
###Chapter 272: I Almost Forgot

"Who's there?" Emily Johnson heard footsteps outside the courtyard.

"It's Daniel River..." David Stone bounded off to open the gate.

Ever since learning his cousin Michael Stone was taking the college entrance exams, Daniel had been dropping by frequently to help out. Not only did he get free meals, but occasionally he'd even score some watermelon or wild berries from the mountains.

On the morning of July 9th, Michael drove the tractor to town, transporting several young villagers and educated youths to take the exams. These young men had originally planned to stop their education after middle school, but when the national college exams were reinstated, their families scraped together resources to send them to high school.

John Stone Sr. tagged along, mainly to keep an eye on the tractor.

Mary Stone stayed home that day to watch her two grandsons. The day before, her daughter-in-law had delivered a large package—malt extract, candies, biscuits, rare canned fruit, and ten pounds of rice.

The journey from the village to town wasn't short.

At noon, everyone ate at the state-run diner.

John Stone Sr., experienced in exam logistics, went ahead to secure seats.

"Where's Dad?"

"At the diner. It's crowded today—we should hurry."

When the group arrived, they found John had already claimed a table.

Everyone ordered plain noodles—none of the villagers had meat ration coupons.

"Emily, was the Chinese exam easy?"

Emily suppressed a smile. Every question she'd predicted had appeared, even the essay topic.

"Let's hope we all pass."

"Yeah..."

There was still one more exam in the afternoon.

After finishing, they regrouped, and Michael drove the tractor back to the village.

Word spread fast. By dinnertime, the entire village knew Michael had taken the exams.

"Michael graduated high school, didn't he?"

"I'd almost forgotten."

"Right, he did attend high school."

"This is Emily's third attempt. Think she'll make it?"

"Who knows..."

That evening, Robert Stone and William Stone came knocking.

"Michael, you really took the exams?"

Michael studied his brothers. "Just wanted to see what it was like."

They exchanged glances. If he and Emily got into college, wouldn't they dump the kids on their parents?

"Worried I'll leave the kids with Mom and Dad? Yours were raised by them too," Michael said, reading their thoughts.

"Michael, it's been years since you graduated..." Robert stammered.

"Michael, how many educated youths divorce and abandon their families after getting into college?" William hinted.

Michael smirked. "Didn't you know, William? My mother-in-law arranged a city job for me. Once Emily gets in, we're moving there with the kids."

"What?!" both brothers exclaimed in unison.

A city job? Their brother's city mother-in-law had actually secured him employment?
###Chapter 273: The College Entrance Exam Turmoil

The Stone brothers walked away with their heads down, their hearts a jumble of emotions.

"Michael's got all the luck," Robert muttered bitterly.

William kicked a pebble on the road. "Yeah, married a city girl, and now he's even got a job."

Standing in the yard, Michael Stone watched his brothers' retreating figures, a cold smirk playing on his lips. He turned and went inside, where his wife was studying under the lamplight.

"Don't push yourself too hard," he said softly.

Emily Johnson looked up, her eyes bright. "Just a few more days."

On the day of the college entrance exam, Michael was up before dawn. He made her brown sugar eggs and fried a few pancakes.

"Eat well—you'll need the energy," he said, piling food into her bowl.

Outside the exam hall, Michael waited until the bell rang. Three days later, when the exams ended, Emily emerged pale and exhausted.

"I'm done," she said weakly, smiling before her vision darkened.

"Emily!" Michael caught her as she collapsed, her skin burning to the touch.

The sound of the tractor startled half the village. Mary Stone, feeding the chickens, rushed out just in time to see her youngest son carrying his wife away.

"Grandma, Mom's sick," little David said, holding his brother's hand, tears in his eyes.

At the clinic, the doctor shook his head after taking her temperature. "103.6°F—we need to bring this fever down now."

Michael wiped her down with alcohol repeatedly until her fever finally broke late that night.

"Water..." Emily whispered weakly, opening her eyes.

"Slowly," Michael said, carefully helping her sit up. "Does anything else hurt?"

Her throat burned, but she shook her head. Seeing the exhaustion in her husband's red-rimmed eyes, her heart ached.

"I'm fine now. You should rest."

Michael stubbornly shook his head. "Not until you're better."

On the way home, Emily leaned against her husband's shoulder. The setting sun stretched their shadows long across the road.

"When will the results come out?" Michael suddenly asked.

"About a month," Emily murmured. "Whether I pass or not, I—"

"Don't say that," Michael cut her off. "You'll pass."

At home, the children rushed to them. Michael scooped up Tommy. "Mom needs rest—be good."

Late that night, Michael watched his sleeping wife, gently wiping the sweat from her brow. Moonlight streamed through the window, casting a silvery glow over the stack of study materials on the desk.
###Chapter 274: Emily's Illness

Mary Stone rushed home with her two grandsons as dusk fell.

"How is she?" Mary asked in a hushed voice.

"Just woke up. The doctor said she should only eat light food." Michael Stone wiped his brow, exhaustion evident in his eyes.

"I should head back. We've got corn to harvest tomorrow." Mary sighed, glancing at the closed bedroom door.

The boys darted inside and hovered by the bed, their eyes wide with concern.

"Mommy, do you still feel bad?" David asked timidly.

Tommy reached out to touch Emily's forehead. "Does it still hurt?"

Emily forced a weak smile. "No, I'm okay now. Did I scare you?"

Both boys shook their heads. The last time she'd been sick, their father hadn't been home, and they'd been terrified.

"Go take your nap," Emily said faintly. "Let Daddy give you a bath?"

David wore a gray undershirt and the latest plastic sandals. Tommy's beach shoes—comfortable though unfashionable—had been carefully chosen by Emily on PennyDeals.

"Mommy should rest first." David, ever the responsible big brother, tugged his sibling toward the door.

Tommy clung to the doorframe. "I wanna stay with Mommy..."

"Mommy needs to sleep," David said sternly.

Michael entered carrying a bowl of mung bean porridge to find his sons wrestling by the doorway.

"What are you doing here?" He frowned. "It's sweltering—get inside."

"Daddy, Mommy—"

"I've got her." Michael slipped past them, his voice softening. "Sweetheart, have some porridge to cool down."

Emily shook her head. "Not hungry."

She'd been careful with her health since arriving nearly a year ago. But after finishing her college entrance exams, the sudden release of tension had triggered a raging fever.

"I added sugar," Michael coaxed.

"Have you eaten?"

"Not yet."

"Go eat." Emily closed her eyes. "I'll sleep a while."

Even the bamboo mat couldn't combat the summer heat. Michael picked up a palm-leaf fan and began gently waving it over her.

He kept vigil all night, even steadying her when she needed the bathroom, afraid she might collapse.

At dawn, the production team's bell echoed through the village.

In the cornfield, workers murmured in surprise at the stark size difference between stalks.

"Why are these ears so big?"

"That's the batch Emily cultivated," someone explained. "The others are from the seeds Team Leader John bought."

"She knows how to do that?"

"Of course—she's educated!"

Team Leader John Stone squatted at the field's edge, meticulously comparing the two corn varieties. He ordered them separated into piles, already calculating something in his mind.
###Chapter 275: Bountiful Corn Harvest

"Team Leader, the corn seedlings cultivated by Emily are thriving much better than the seeds we bought!" Old Lee rubbed his hands excitedly. "I counted—each cob has thirty percent more kernels than previous years!"

In the past, using old corn as seeds had always yielded disappointing harvests. But this year was different. Emily's seedling techniques had produced exceptionally plump corn. John Stone Sr. gazed at the golden cornfield, silently relieved he had allowed his third son's wife to experiment.

"Three days, and we've finally finished harvesting," the accountant said, wiping sweat from his brow.

"These cobs are so heavy—we're getting an extra hundred pounds per acre!"

"Exactly! I was worried we'd go hungry this year..."

"Don't celebrate too soon," someone interjected. "No matter how good the corn is, it still can't compare to rice."

After delivering the agricultural tax quota, each household received their share of the heavy corn. Michael Stone eagerly carried a sack of cornmeal home. "Sweetheart, I ground some cornmeal. I'll make buns for you..."

Emily looked at the golden-yellow cornmeal and suddenly remembered the steamed corn cakes from her past life. Her eyes lit up. "How about trying steamed corn cake instead?"

"Steamed cake?" Michael scratched his head. "I don't know how to make that."

"I'll do it!" Emily rolled up her sleeves, adding yeast, milk, and sugar to the cornmeal. While the dough rose, she dug out her treasured raisins.

The moment the steamer released its fragrant steam, the sweet aroma filled the entire kitchen.

"Mommy, it smells so good!" Tommy circled the stove like a little hungry kitten.

As soon as the cake was ready, Emily cut small pieces for both children and divided the rest into three portions. "David, take your brother to deliver these to Grandma, Uncle Robert, and Uncle William."

Tommy pouted. "I don't want to give any to Uncle William's family..."

"Be good. If you see Richard or George Jr., just hand it to them directly." Emily patted her younger son's head.

The brothers set off with their baskets, heading first to the main house.

"Grandma, Mommy made steamed corn cake!" David stretched on his tiptoes to pass the basket.

Mary Stone lifted the cloth, revealing golden cake studded with purple-red raisins—irresistibly tempting.

On their way back, they indeed ran into Richard and George Jr.

"This is for you." David handed over the cake and quickly pulled his brother away.

By the time they returned home, the rice paddies were already bustling. Workers bent over, pulling weeds amid cheerful chatter.

Team Leader John Stone walked through the fields with several squad leaders, inspecting the rice now in bloom.

"How's the harvest in the neighboring team?"

"Word is they've had reduced yields," one squad leader sighed. "Especially Red Banner Team—their corn harvest is less than half of last year's."

"Thank goodness our team leader had the foresight," the accountant remarked. "Letting Emily handle the seedlings saved us from disaster."

Golden sunlight spilled over the paddies, where heavy rice stalks swayed gently in the breeze—a promise of yet another abundant year.
###Chapter 276: The College Entrance Exam Storm

"That potion from Emily Johnson costs ten dollars per pound!" A group of villagers squatted by the field, chatting.

"Exactly! If it weren't for Captain Richard Lopez biting the bullet and buying it, our harvest this year would've been ruined!"

John Stone Sr.'s cousin puffed on his pipe, squinting. "After the autumn harvest, we ought to reward Emily. That stuff saved our lives."

Everyone nodded in agreement. The memory of past years spent starving still sent shivers down their spines.

Over at the Johnson family's courtyard, Anthony Johnson barged in, lunchbox in hand.

"Mom, when's Emily coming back?" he asked impatiently. "Didn't they say they'd find her husband a job? It's been half a year already!"

Margaret Johnson, sorting vegetables, didn't look up. "She just finished her college entrance exams. We're waiting for the admission letter. If there's no news by the start of the semester, we'll have them come to the city."

She glanced at the lunchbox. "Since when do you splurge on meat?"

Ever since the family split, her younger son had been visiting more often—especially with that chubby grandson of his, toddling around adorably.

"Just missed you and Dad, that's all," Anthony grinned, sidling closer. "Has Richard visited lately?"

Margaret snorted. "Your father's about to come home. Have you talked to Emily?"

"Last month she sent me some mountain goods. My wife sent back some fabric in return." He scratched his head. "Mom, do you think she'll get in?"

Margaret sighed. All four children were married now. She'd once hoped her eldest daughter would go to college, but that never happened. As for the boys—one was already in his thirties, and the other had never been a standout student.

"If she gets in, you're cooking the celebration feast," Margaret said suddenly.

Anthony thumped his chest. "Absolutely! My father-in-law taught me well—I'll make sure Emily's honored properly!"

Just then, Henry Johnson pushed the door open.

"Dad!" Anthony jumped up. "Brought you braised pork—eat it while it's hot! Gotta run!"

Before Henry could react, his son had already vanished.

"What did that rascal want?" Henry asked suspiciously.

Margaret opened the lunchbox, releasing a rich aroma. "Just bringing you some warmth. Close the door and let's eat!"

The elderly couple had barely picked up their chopsticks when the postman's voice rang out: "Registered mail for the Johnsons! From the capital!"

Margaret's hands trembled, scattering vegetable leaves across the floor.
###Chapter 277: The Stolen Life

"Will Emily pass the exam this time?" Mr. Johnson overheard his coworkers discussing the college entrance exams in the workshop, his heart pounding with unease.

"They say this year's test is even harder than last year's." His colleague's words only deepened Mr. Johnson's worry.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Johnson was cooking in the kitchen when her spatula suddenly stilled. "Henry, I heard from Aunt Wang next door that years ago, someone stole another student's identity to get into college..."

Clang! Mr. Johnson's enamel mug slipped from his hand and hit the floor.

"Look at all those certificates on the wall." Mrs. Johnson pointed at the yellowed awards, her voice trembling. "Emily was always top of her class. How could she fail twice in a row?"

Mr. Johnson stared at the certificates, his fingers shaking slightly. Their youngest daughter might be a bit spoiled, but she had never given them trouble with her studies.

"Write to Emily—now!" He stood abruptly. "Tell her to check with her school. If that doesn’t work, go straight to the education bureau!"

This was a matter that could shape her entire future. College graduates were highly valued, and the Johnson family had never had one.

Mrs. Johnson abandoned the dishes and rushed to pen the letter. The scratch of her pen was hurried, the handwriting uneven with urgency.

Meanwhile, Emily Johnson knelt beneath the grapevines, completely unaware of the brewing storm. As someone from the 21st century, she never imagined that in this era, even college admission results could be stolen.

"Mommy, the grapes are turning purple!" Little Tommy stretched on his tiptoes, eyes fixed on the clusters of glistening fruit.

"Just wait two more days. They’ll be even sweeter when they turn dark purple." Emily ruffled his hair. These two grapevines were her pride, secretly nurtured with treasures from her space.

Michael Stone walked in, a hoe slung over his shoulder, and chuckled at the sight of his wife and sons obsessing over the vines. "You three planning to stare these grapes into ripening?"

At dinner, Michael shared village gossip. "Charles is engaged to a girl from Lopez Village. Samuel still refuses to meet any matchmakers..."

After the meal, Emily took a stroll along the golden-lit ridges of the fields. In the distance, Daisy Miller waved at her, her rounded belly prominent.

"Congratulations! You're expecting?" Emily eyed her swollen abdomen in surprise.

Daisy grinned. "Five months along! My mother-in-law won’t even let me step into the fields now." She lowered her voice. "Margaret Lee went into early labor—pushed by that widow sister-in-law of hers. She had a son, but they say she might not conceive again..."

The evening breeze carried the scent of rice seedlings, but Emily shivered suddenly. A strange premonition settled over her—something big was about to happen.
###Chapter 278: Isn't Painless Motherhood Wonderful?

Daisy Miller suddenly lowered her voice. "I heard her husband was so furious he smashed all the bowls at home. He swore that if Margaret Lee's family dares to show up again, he'll gather people to beat them up."

These days, who doesn't hope for a house full of children?

Margaret's miscarriage had damaged her health badly—she might never conceive again.

"Are they cutting ties?"

Daisy scoffed. "Do you think that sly old fox George Lee would allow it? He's been counting on his wealthy son-in-law for a comfortable life."

She used to think George was simple and honest.

Now she knew—he was nothing but a man who'd sell his own daughter.

Changing the subject, Daisy asked, "Emily, it's been a while since you had Tommy. Don't you want to give David and Tommy a little sister?"

Another child?

Emily Johnson remembered the morning sickness, the excruciating labor pains, and the exhaustion of raising two children alone.

"I must not be destined to have a daughter. David and Tommy are enough for me."

Daisy glanced at the two brothers practicing their letters nearby and understood.

"True. Raising twins by yourself back then couldn't have been easy."

She sighed. "This year's corn harvest was poor in nearby brigades. Ours was the only one with a decent yield. My parents' brigade had some losses too, but it's better than others."

She could secretly help her family if they were truly starving, but too much would displease her in-laws.

"As long as there's enough to eat," Emily said softly.

Daisy nodded. "Now that the brigade isn't limiting how many chickens we can raise, many aunties have been selling eggs at the Supply & Market."

She then mentioned how Michael Stone often came to buy eggs.

"Michael, when are we going hunting?" Daniel River rubbed his hands eagerly.

After spring plowing, Michael had been preparing for college entrance exams, so Daniel hadn't dared to disturb him.

"Tomorrow," Michael replied, wiping his hoe.

Daniel jumped with excitement. "Perfect!"

Hesitating, he added, "Michael, I heard several brigades might face hunger this year because of bad seed stock."

Michael thought of the demoted official and snorted coldly.

"By the way, when will our brigade divide the land?"

"Need to ask again..."

Daniel scratched his head. "Um... Michael, the day after tomorrow, I have a matchmaking meeting. I was hoping to get some game..."

"How's Charles doing?"

"The Clarks are quite pleased, and Charles has no objections either." Both Daniel and Charles Clark had endured hardships—finally, they could marry.

"My mother said they'll divide the household after my wedding," Daniel admitted sheepishly.

"Good," Michael nodded.

He could tell Daniel's parents had been inspired by how well his own family had thrived after their household division.
###Chapter 279: Unexpected Matchmaking

"Splitting the family might be for the best," Emily Johnson murmured, her lips curving slightly as understanding flickered in her eyes.

Michael Stone paused mid-swing, his axe hovering over the firewood. He wiped sweat from his brow and glanced up at his cousin. "Daniel, I was thinking of building a house next to yours," Daniel River said eagerly. "It'd make visiting easier."

"Sounds good," Michael replied, setting the axe down. "Just make sure to apply for the homestead land with the brigade early."

The next morning, Emily rose before dawn. The town market bustled more than usual, and she deftly slipped a few pieces of fruit from her hidden inventory while blending into the crowd.

"Mom, can I come too?" David clung to the doorframe, eyes wide with hope.

Emily adjusted her straw hat. "The sun's too harsh today. Stay home and behave." She pressed a bunch of grapes into each child's hands. "These should keep you happy."

Back at the Stone household, Mary Stone was airing quilts in the yard when Emily entered with a bamboo basket. Her brows twitched at the sight.

"Mother, I got lucky today—found a fruit seller." Emily lifted the cloth cover, revealing plump pears and bananas. Then, lowering her voice, she added, "And this malt extract... for you and Father to regain strength."

Mary inhaled sharply. "This must've cost a fortune—"

"Not at all," Emily said with a playful wink. "Oh, and I bought a watermelon too. Why don't you both come over tonight?"

After Emily left, Mary stared at the jar of malt extract in disbelief. John Stone Sr. entered, puffing on his pipe. "Emily brought gifts again?"

"Indeed," Mary sighed. "This malt extract..."

"Keep it," John said, squinting. "If those two really get into university, we'll be the ones looking after the boys."

As dusk fell, Daniel burst into the yard in a flurry. "Emily, could you do me a huge favor tomorrow?"

Emily looked up from sorting vegetables. "What's the rush?"

"My matchmaking meeting!" Daniel wrung his hands. "The girl's coming to see our home, and I thought—since you're educated—you could help judge..."

Emily stilled. "Is it proper for me to be there?"

"Absolutely!" Daniel's ears turned pink. "She's literate, and I just need you in the main room serving tea. That's all."

Emily nodded thoughtfully. She didn't notice Michael's gaze darkening under the eaves.

###Chapter 280: The River Family's Matchmaking

"Sister-in-law, you've seen more of the world," Daniel River said with a grin, his eyes crinkling into slits.

Emily Johnson suppressed an inward sigh. She truly hadn't witnessed a matchmaking scene from this era before.

"Alright."

Since they'd come to invite her personally, it would be impolite to refuse.

After the college entrance exams ended, she still read books but no longer buried herself in study like during exam preparations. To cultivate David and Tommy's reading habits, the three often read together. When they encountered difficult questions, she patiently explained. If she didn't know the answer, she'd have them jot it down to research later.

After breakfast, Emily instructed her sons, "Play on your own—read or go outside if you want."

Though summer had tanned them, David and Tommy remained fairer than other village children.

Today she was attending as a guest, so she dressed more carefully. She wore a light blue blouse with a bow-tied collar, paired with a floral-print skirt and white soft-soled sandals. Her hair was swept into a simple bun, and she'd applied a touch of lipstick for color.

"Who's that?"
"Isn't that Emily Johnson?"
"My goodness, she cleans up so beautifully?"
"Michael spoils his wife—won't let her work the fields. Her family sends gifts often too. No wonder she's so well-kept."

Children playing outside stared curiously as she passed.

The River family home appeared shabbier than Captain John Stone's residence. Upon entering, Martha River greeted her warmly.

"Dear niece, thank you for coming today. I heard the girl's cousin married into town. Your mother-in-law will join us soon."

Elizabeth Stone stole glances at Emily's slender waist, thinking privately: How could this be the figure of a mother of two? Her skin glowed without a blemish, and her clothes were so stylish.

"Aunt, this is my first time..."

Martha patted her hand. "Don't worry, just treat it like casual conversation."

Soon, Mary Stone arrived.

"Mother."
"You came too, third daughter-in-law?"

The house was set with candies and sunflower seeds, awaiting the young woman's arrival.

Daniel had dressed smartly in a white shirt and black trousers, though his Liberation shoes somewhat ruined the effect.

"Mother, why aren't you wearing the sandals I bought you?" Emily noticed Mary's cloth shoes. In this heat, they must be stifling.
###Chapter 281: Martha River's Envy

"Save the new clothes for visiting relatives."

This was the common mindset among the older generation in the village. At home, they wore whatever was comfortable, but when going out, they dressed in their best.

"Shoes are meant to be worn. They'll last for years," Mary Stone said, dusting off her shoes.

Martha River listened to their conversation, her heart souring with envy. She had children of her own, but compared to this niece-in-law, they paled in comparison.

But envy wouldn't change anything. Her niece-in-law was a city girl, and her family still sent packages and money regularly.

"After suffering for most of your life, it's time to enjoy some comfort," Emily Johnson's words made Mary Stone and Martha River's eyes well up.

Mary Stone had learned to let go. Her sons had all moved out, and she and her husband now lived quietly on their own.

Seeing her sister-in-law's family thriving, with Emily frequently sending over food and inviting her in-laws for meals, Martha River couldn't help but feel a pang of bitterness.

"They're here!" Martha River hurried out to greet them.

The girl's family had brought three people: a middle-aged woman, a young woman in her early twenties, and a girl around eighteen or nineteen. It was obvious the youngest was the one being introduced for the matchmaking.

At first, the girl's family had held themselves with an air of superiority, thinking they had the upper hand. But the moment they stepped inside, they were stunned—there, in the house, stood a stylish city girl who looked like a movie star from a magazine.

The matchmaker, Lucy Smith, was from the neighboring village. She had heard of Emily but never met her. Seeing the girl's family staring, Lucy quickly pulled Martha aside. "Why is there another girl here?"

"That's my niece-in-law!" Martha raised her voice. "Michael Stone's wife."

Lucy immediately understood. Michael Stone was well-known in the area—a handsome high school graduate with a reputation for being too quick to fight, making matchmakers hesitant to arrange anything for him.

"Have some water..." Martha served sweetened water, easing the tension slightly.

"Where do you work, comrade?" the girl's cousin asked Emily, eyeing her refined demeanor. She must be someone with a city job.

Emily smiled faintly. "I'm not working right now. I just took the college entrance exams and am waiting for the results."

College exams? The girl's family exchanged glances. So she had quit her job to take the exams—how ambitious.

"This is my son, Daniel..." Martha quickly pushed Daniel River forward.

Daniel was unusually well-behaved today, greeting them politely. The girl had dark skin, but so did Daniel. With Emily's porcelain complexion beside them, their skin tones actually complemented each other.

"Comrade Emily, are you a sent-down youth?" the girl's mother asked, a hint of condescension in her tone.

A cold glint flashed in Emily's eyes, but she maintained a gentle smile. "Yes. But with my parents and husband supporting me, I don’t need to work in the fields." She emphasized the word "husband" deliberately.
###Chapter 282: Playing the Damsel Isn't Easy

"Since you're so curious about me, I'll satisfy your curiosity." Emily Johnson smiled faintly.

The bride's cousin adjusted her collar with false elegance. "A woman should have her own career. It's humiliating to beg for money from a man."

The barb was obvious.

"My husband says providing for the family is his duty." Emily suppressed her disgust, maintaining her gentle facade. "I'm not as capable as you, sister. I have to rely on my man."

She nearly bit her tongue saying those words.

Playing the delicate flower didn't come naturally. Praising her husband while pretending to be helpless—it felt foreign.

The woman opposite couldn't hide her smugness. Pretty face meant nothing if you depended on a man. Not like her with a stable government job and steady paycheck.

"Our Michael dotes on his wife," Mary Stone interjected. "Since marrying Emily, he won't even let her lift a finger."

The bride's mother quickly countered, "My daughter's the hardest worker you'll find."

Plain looks mattered less than being useful. That's what made a good wife.

The prospective bride kept her head bowed, silent as a mouse. Daniel River sat uncharacteristically quiet—a stark contrast to his usual chatter.

The matchmaker Lucy Smith broke the tension. "Daisy's known throughout the village for her diligence. She masters all household chores."

Turning to Daniel, she added, "Young Daniel earns full work points, handsome too, and his uncle's the brigade leader—"

"Sister-in-law..." Daniel suddenly spoke.

Emily raised an eyebrow. Had he taken a liking to the girl?

"What is it?"

Daniel fumbled for words while the girl remained statue-still.

Lucy restated both families' merits. This was Daniel's first matchmaking meeting—his awkwardness showed.

The bride's mother pulled Lucy aside, whispering about dowry demands. Lucy's expression shifted upon hearing the figure.

"They want..." Lucy quoted the sum.

Martha River barely stifled a gasp.

Daniel blinked at his mother's sudden glare. What had he done? Emily almost laughed at his bewildered look, pinching herself to stay composed.

Martha seethed silently.

Lucy continued mediating. She'd only recommended this match because of the girl's renowned diligence. But seeing Emily today—the young woman's beauty outshone every village girl for miles.

"Daniel, take Daisy for a walk," Lucy suggested, wanting to discuss dowry privately.

Worried about propriety, Martha added, "Sam, go with your uncle."

A child chaperone would prevent gossip.

Daniel grew more confused. First the glare, now this? Was the match settled? He hadn't decided yet!

But filial duty prevailed. He took Sam's hand and led the way outside.

The room held Martha, Mary, Emily facing the bride's mother, cousin, and Lucy.

An invisible battle line had been drawn.

Emily wondered: Why did this first meeting feel like wedding negotiations already?
###Chapter 283: The Matchmaking Showdown

"Isn't it too hasty to settle the marriage today?" Emily Johnson thought to herself, stealing glances at Daniel River across the table. The man in question hadn't uttered a word the entire time.

Though arranged marriages weren't entirely blind these days, discussing marriage at the first meeting still felt uncomfortably rushed.

"Does your daughter fancy my son?" Martha River cut straight to the chase.

The girl's mother's eyes darted shrewdly. "Will they live separately after marriage?"

Emily immediately understood—they were banking on Daniel's uncle being the production team leader.

"Right after the wedding," Martha replied breezily. She'd long planned for both sons to establish separate households once married, scoffing at the outdated notion that elders must live with one child.

"Let's be frank—the bride price must be clarified," the girl's cousin interjected, her gaze flickering between both families.

Mary Stone smiled. "We'll follow village customs."

Martha suddenly turned to Emily, her words laced with implication. "My sister-in-law is truly blessed. When Michael married, not a penny was spent on the bride price. In fact, her family sends money and gifts every month."

Emily stiffened. The seemingly complimentary remark was clearly a power move to intimidate the other family.

Sure enough, the cousin's probing look seemed to ask: What kind of bride pays to marry these days?

"My third son treats his wife exceedingly well..." Mary hurriedly smoothed things over.

"The thirty-six-legged furniture set is non-negotiable," the mother stated her terms.

"Naturally."

"Eighty for the bride price."

Eighty? Emily barely stifled a gasp. Though Daniel had earned some money working away last year, this amount was exorbitant.

Mary restrained the fuming Martha with a hand, smiling. "And the dowry?"

"Two quilts."

Seeing negotiations teetering, the matchmaker hastily mediated. They finally settled on the furniture set, sixty-eight for the bride price, plus a new outfit for the bride—while the girl's family would provide two quilts, a washbasin, and a slightly defective thermos.

Emily sat stunned throughout. The marriage was decided—just like that? The speed left her reeling.
###Chapter 284: The Matchmaking Affair

"Emily..." Martha River tugged at Emily Johnson's sleeve, gesturing hesitantly toward the main house.

Mary Stone lowered her voice. "Country matchmaking works this way. If they like each other, they discuss the dowry right away."

Emily blinked. That was fast.

"They're already planning the wedding?"

"Yes, but the earliest would be after harvest season." Mary counted on her fingers. "Making furniture takes time, and preparing the dowry does too."

Just then, Daniel River returned with his potential bride. The girl wore a floral blouse, her cheeks flushed pink as she stole glances at Daniel.

Lunch was lavish—braised pork, stewed chicken, and stir-fried vegetables covered the table. Emily, as an accompanying guest, ate slowly while making polite conversation.

After seeing off the visitors, Emily had barely stepped into her own yard when two little figures came barreling toward her.

"Mommy!" David Stone looked up at her. "Is Uncle Daniel's bride pretty?"

Tommy tugged at her clothes. "Daddy said there was good food today, but we didn't get to go."

Michael Stone emerged from the house, taking her bag. "How did it go?"

"Your cousin seems quite taken with her," Emily wiped her brow. "But they settled the dowry and wedding gifts on the spot. Isn't that rushing things?"

Michael chuckled. "Country matchmaking is straightforward. Once they're interested, they get right to the point."

Emily suddenly realized. "So I was just there for show?"

"What show?" Michael frowned at the unfamiliar term.

"I mean..." Emily pouted. "When I married you, I didn't ask for a dowry. My family even paid extra."

Michael's eyes darkened as he leaned close to her ear. "I'll make it up to you tonight, sweetheart."

"You!" Emily's ears burned as she pushed him away. "Dream on!"

Since the college entrance exams ended, the man had been insatiable. She'd been using the summer heat as an excuse to fend him off.

"David, Tommy, nap time." Michael's stern tone sent the boys scurrying inside. They knew that voice meant their parents wanted privacy.

Emily hurried into the house. The August sun was relentless, her back soaked with sweat. Without air conditioning—or even an electric fan, a luxury in these times—she relied on mosquito coils, floral water, and discreet insecticide sprays.

"Let me fan you." Michael followed, picking up a palm-leaf fan.

Emily didn't refuse, changing into her homemade cotton short-sleeve—much cooler than the polyester blends from the Supply & Market.

"Tell me..." She turned suddenly. "Did I sell myself too cheap back then?"

Michael paused mid-motion before kissing her forehead. "I was the persistent one. I had my eye on you from the day you arrived in the village."

Emily recalled the original host's memories. If not for that local troublemaker's attempted assault and Michael's timely rescue, she might never have agreed to marry him.

"Silver-tongued devil," she chided, but couldn't suppress a smile.
###Chapter 285: Only You

The summer cicadas chirped incessantly as Michael Stone tossed and turned on the bed, unable to sleep. A bitter smile tugged at his lips as he recalled the days when the villagers had whispered about him behind his back.

Back then, they'd called him lazy and aimless, never knowing he'd secretly been running small businesses to earn his own high school tuition.

"Michael..." Daniel River's voice interrupted his thoughts from outside the door.

"Come in."

Daniel entered, his sun-darkened face tinged with shyness. "About yesterday's matchmaking..."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Not interested?"

"No..." Daniel scratched his head. "Her name's Daisy. She's... hardworking."

Michael recognized that look. When he'd married Emily, the villagers had gossiped too—claiming he'd wed a spoiled city girl who'd make his life miserable.

"Michael, do you think I should..." Daniel trailed off uncertainly.

"What do you feel?" Michael countered. "This is your life partner we're talking about."

Daniel sighed. "I'm not as lucky as you..."

Just then, Emily entered carrying sliced watermelon. Her pale blue dress accentuated her porcelain skin, and Michael's gaze instantly locked onto his wife.

"Have some," she said, setting the plate down before turning to leave.

Michael caught her hand. "Stay with me awhile."

Emily glanced at him. "I need to prepare lessons."

"Just for a minute?" He gave her his best pleading look.

Taking the hint, Daniel stood. "I'll head out now."

Once alone, Michael pulled Emily into his arms. "Are you upset with me?"

"Why would I be?" She averted her face.

He whispered by her ear, "I'd choose no one but you."

A flush crept up her neck as she pushed him away. "Stop that."

"I mean it." His intense gaze held hers. "You're the only one for me."

Emily's pulse quickened under his burning stare. Despite his rural roots, this man carried himself with urban sophistication—especially those deep-set eyes that always melted her resolve.

"Rest now," she murmured. "You've got work this afternoon."

But Michael tightened his embrace. "Stay with me."

"You're impossible..." Yet she relented, lying down beside him.

Content, Michael breathed in her floral scent. He still remembered their first meeting—the vision of her in white standing by the educated youth quarters, radiant as a magnolia blossom.

"Emily..."

"Hmm?"

"Nothing. Just wanted to say your name."

She turned her back to him. "Fool."

Michael chuckled, holding her closer. Let the villagers gossip about how he spoiled his wife. Emily was his to cherish.

That afternoon, Daniel approached him again. "Michael, I'm thinking of marrying after harvest."

"What about the brick house?" Michael wiped sweat from his brow.

Daniel shook his head. "Too showy."

Michael understood. He'd felt the same when building his three adobe rooms after dividing the family property. But now...

"Come to me if you need money," he said, clapping Daniel's shoulder.

Daniel nodded gratefully. Everyone knew Michael had prospered these past years, though he never flaunted it.

"About Daisy..." Daniel hesitated.

"What?"

"She wants to keep working after marriage..."

Michael blinked, then grinned. "That's good, isn't it? Emily still teaches."

Daniel scratched his head. "I just worry what people will say..."

"Who cares?" Michael scoffed. "You live your own life."

At sunset, Michael spotted Emily waiting at their gate, her dress fluttering in the breeze like a painting come to life.

In that moment, Michael knew with absolute certainty—she was the only one for him.
###Chapter 286: Blood for Blood

"Can we negotiate the price?"

Michael Stone gave him a sidelong glance. "Just say it's a loan. The main house must be built with bricks and tiles. The kitchen and storage can make do with adobe."

After a moment's consideration, the man nodded in agreement.

As the work bell rang, the crowd dispersed toward their homes.

"Daniel! Come quick!" Martha River's anguished cry pierced through the courtyard walls. "Your sister's in trouble!"

Daniel River's heart clenched. He sprinted into the yard in three strides. "What happened?"

"Those Garcia bastards beat your sister so badly she's in the hospital!" Martha trembled violently. "Your father went to fetch your uncle. We need to get to town now!"

"What?!" Daniel's fists clenched until his knuckles cracked. "Forget the ox cart! I'll get Michael to drive the tractor!"

He turned and bolted toward the Stone residence, kicking up dust with every step.

"Michael! Michael!" Daniel's voice was hoarse from shouting.

Michael paused mid-bite, chopsticks hovering over his bowl. That tone never meant anything good.

"Jessica's been beaten by the Garcias and hospitalized!"

Clang—

Emily Johnson's bowl crashed onto the table. That timid girl who'd shyly called her "sister-in-law" during New Year's was now...

"Let's go!" Michael slammed down his chopsticks and charged out.

"Be careful," Emily called after him, though her stomach churned. Domestic violence? Hospitalized? This could turn deadly!

The children tugged at her sleeves. "Mommy, what happened to Aunt Jessica?"

"The adults will handle it." She ruffled their hair. "Finish your dinner."

The tractor rumbled up to the River household. William Stone jumped aboard with a dark expression—family bonds ran deeper than petty disputes.

"Sam!" Martha suddenly grabbed her grandson's hand. "Go get your aunt Emily!"

The boy took off like a shot.

Emily was clearing the table when she heard the high-pitched shout.

"Grandma wants you!"

Her hands froze. Were they... gathering a mob?

But when elders summoned, you obeyed.

"Lock the door," she said hurriedly, tying up her hair, changing into rubber boots, and grabbing a pack of egg cakes before running out.

The tractor's trailer was packed. Mary Stone wiped tears while John Stone Sr. looked murderous. The three Stone men's muscles were taut, and Patricia Stone gripped a fire poker.

"What are you doing here?" Michael gaped.

"Your wife's got backbone!" Martha pulled Emily aboard with red-rimmed eyes.

The hospital reeked of antiseptic. On the bed lay Jessica River, frail as a dried leaf, blood crusted on her face.

"Animals!" Daniel punched the wall.

"Where are those Garcia bastards?" Michael's teeth ground audibly.

A trembling doctor handed over the medical chart, the pages fluttering in his unsteady hands.
###Chapter 287: Blood for Blood

"The patient has fractures in the third and fourth ribs on the left side, along with multiple soft tissue contusions..."

The doctor's words cut through the Stone family like a knife. Martha River's legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed to the floor.

Emily Johnson clenched her fists so tightly her knuckles turned white. The bruised and swollen face on the hospital bed bore no resemblance to the cheerful Jessica they all knew.

"She must divorce him," Michael Stone said, his voice icy.

John River's lips trembled. "But—"

"Dad!" Daniel River grabbed his father by the collar. "Are you waiting to collect her corpse?"

John Stone Sr. kicked over a chair in the ward. "If you don't agree today, I'll break your legs myself!"

"Mom..." A weak voice came from the bed. Jessica had woken up, tears mixing with blood as they trailed into her hairline.

Martha rushed to her daughter's side, her hands shaking too much to touch her. "I'm here, sweetheart. I'll make this right..."

Emily quietly slipped out of the room and retrieved a sponge cake and some spring water from her space. When she returned, she overheard Michael giving orders: "Daniel, get the tractor. Robert, find some rope."

The tractor roared to life, carrying a truckload of fury straight to the Garcia household.

Bang!

Michael kicked the Garcia's front door open to find the family gathered around a table of braised pork. The laughter died instantly.

"Smash everything!" Martha grabbed a stool and swung it at the dining table.

Amid the shattering of porcelain, Mrs. Garcia shrieked, "You crazy bi—"

Before she could finish, Martha seized her hair and delivered two sharp slaps that left her seeing stars. Elizabeth Stone yanked at Mrs. Garcia's waistband, tearing her pants and exposing her floral underwear to the room.

Emily wielded a baseball bat, targeting joints with precision—each strike sending the Garcias hopping in pain. When Lily Garcia tried to sneak away, Emily blocked her path, pressing the bat against her throat. "Move, and I'll break your legs."

Nearby, the Stone brothers had Christopher pinned. Daniel aimed kicks at his ribs while Michael's fists drew blood with every punch.

"Help! Murder!" Lily screamed—only to be silenced by Emily's backhanded slap.

"Scared now?" Emily stepped on her wrist, pressing the bat to her temple. "Did Jessica beg like this when you beat her?"

A few Garcia children lunged forward, but Emily slammed the bat onto a brick, splitting it clean in half. The kids wailed in terror.

"Enough!"

An old man's roar cut through the chaos as Mr. Garcia appeared with his cane. Michael wiped blood from his face and smirked. "Perfect. The old bastard's here."
###Chapter 288: Divorce, It's Happening!

The scorching sun beat down on the dirt road of the Garcia Village, kicking up clouds of dust.

"Captain Stone... please stop them..." Captain Garcia arrived panting, sweat beading on his forehead.

John Stone Sr. took a drag from his pipe, squinting. "Let them vent, Old Garcia. My niece is still lying in the clinic, fighting for her life. If this turns fatal..."

He didn’t finish, but the implication was clear.

The villagers who had been ready to intervene hesitated. Every family had sons who needed wives—who would marry into a village known for "beating wives to death"?

"They’ll kill him if this goes on..." Captain Garcia’s voice trembled as he watched the Garcia men writhing on the ground.

"Divorce! It’s happening!" Michael Stone delivered another kick to Christopher Garcia’s stomach, making him gasp in pain.

Christopher, his face swollen, slurred, "She... couldn’t bear children..."

"Bull!" Emily Johnson yanked off her straw hat, her voice sharp. "Infertility could be the man’s fault too!"

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

"You’re the problem, and you blame her?" Michael kicked him again. "Pathetic!"

Emily scanned the crowd, raising her voice. "Women aren’t the only ones who can be infertile—some men just shift the blame!"

Dressed in a crisp white blouse, she stood out among the dust-covered villagers. Though fierce in the fight, her words were measured—clearly an educated woman.

"Take Christopher to finalize the divorce! And return every last bit of her dowry!" John Stone Sr. declared.

Daniel River dragged Christopher by the collar while William Stone gathered men to retrieve the dowry. The Garcia family huddled against the wall, not daring to interfere.

Patricia Stone peeked at Emily from the crowd. Remembering their past fights, she realized Emily had held back—today, she’d seen her swing a stick like she could take on ten men.

Only after the Stones left did Mrs. Garcia collapse, wailing, "This is a curse..."

The daughters-in-law helped each other inside—there’d be no work in the fields that afternoon.

At the town’s civil office, the clerk processed the divorce without question upon hearing the wife was critically injured. Daniel shoved Christopher outside and kicked him away. "Get lost!"

"Emily—" Michael suddenly remembered and quickly placed the straw hat back on her head. "Go home first. I need to make another stop in town."

Belatedly, he regretted it—she’d seen him brawling! All his usual gentlemanly pretense was ruined. Damn those Garcias.

Emily gave him an amused glance before turning toward home. Under the hat, her lips curled—her husband was downright dashing in a fight.
###Chapter 289: Violence Breeds Villains

"Why did Aunt Martha suddenly call my wife over?" Michael Stone frowned deeply.

"I'll head back first." Emily Johnson nodded politely to Aunt Martha and the others.

"Emily, we couldn't have done it without you today." Aunt Martha grasped her hand, eyes wide with astonishment. She'd assumed this city-born niece-in-law would be delicate, but the woman fought more fiercely than any man.

Patricia Stone scurried home with her neck tucked in, heart pounding. From now on, she'd steer clear of the third son's wife—those terrifying swings of the wooden rod still haunted her.

At the clinic, little Sam River's eyes were swollen from crying, tiny fingers clutching his aunt's blanket.

"Still unconscious?" Daniel River's voice trembled.

Sam shook his head, fresh tears falling.

Daniel's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists, itching to break every bone in Christopher Garcia's body.

Meanwhile, chaos reigned at the Garcia household. Christopher groaned in bed while his mother wailed, "What sin have we committed? Is that Stone woman the devil incarnate?"

News spread like wildfire across the villages.

"Did you hear? Michael Stone's wife single-handedly took down five Garcia men!"

"My cousin saw it—she wielded that rod like a whirlwind!"

Emily had just finished bathing, her hair still dripping, when Daisy Miller burst in.

"You actually beat up the Garcias?" Daisy's eyes bulged. "They say you knocked them down like whack-a-moles!"

Emily massaged her temples. "It wasn't that dramatic..."

"Those Garcias are monsters!" Daisy slammed the table after hearing the full story. "Breaking ribs? That's attempted murder!"

Two small faces peeked from behind the door. David bit his lip. "Mommy, will Aunt Jessica die?"

Emily's heart clenched as she knelt to embrace her son. "No, sweetheart. When she's better, we'll visit her."

Outside, the blood-red sunset cast an uneasy glow. Emily tightened her grip on the wooden rod as she gazed toward the clinic—if anything happened to her sister-in-law, she'd gladly let the Garcias taste its wrath again.
###Chapter 290: Jessica's Decision

"Mom, is Aunt Jessica getting divorced?" Tommy suddenly asked, tilting his flour-dusted face upward.

Emily's spatula stilled mid-stir. How did the children know about the divorce? No one in the village had ever divorced before.

"Yes," she answered, crouching to wipe flour from Tommy's cheek. "Because her husband hit her."

David immediately clenched his small fists. "Hitting people is wrong!"

"Exactly. That's why we need to protect Aunt Jessica." Emily ruffled both boys' hair. "Now, help me finish dinner. Dad will be hungry soon."

As the aroma of cooking filled the kitchen, Emily kept glancing at the door. Darkness had fallen—why wasn't Michael home yet?

"David, run to Grandma's and see where your father is."

At the clinic, Jessica finally opened her eyes.

"Dad... Mom..." Her voice cracked, tears spilling instantly.

Martha River swatted her daughter's shoulder, torn between anger and heartache. "Foolish girl! How could you hide such bruises from us?"

"I'm sorry, Mom..." Jessica sobbed uncontrollably.

The doctor insisted on overnight observation, leaving only Martha as caretaker. The others trudged home through the night.

When Michael returned with the boys, dinner had gone cold.

"Daniel took Christopher to finalize the divorce," he said between rapid bites. "Made the Garcias pay medical expenses too."

Emily pushed a steaming bowl of soup toward him. "Jessica woke up?"

"She did, but needs more rest." Michael wiped his mouth. "The whole village is talking."

The boys bolted outside after eating. Once their footsteps faded, Emily lowered her voice. "I made sure everyone knows Christopher beat her because he's infertile."

Michael abruptly set down his chopsticks. "Emily... today I..."

"Hmm?"

"I worried I frightened you." He stared at his plate. "The way I fought..."

Emily laughed softly. "Did you forget I swung a rolling pin too?"

Michael's ears burned red. His cousins had said Martha would've been outmatched without Emily's intervention.

"I saw." His voice thickened. "The way you wielded that rolling pin... it was magnificent."

Outside the window, two small heads ducked out of sight. David whispered, "Dad just called Mom magnificent!"
###Chapter 291: Jessica's Burden

"My wife is the best!" Michael Stone exclaimed, his eyes shining with pride as he beamed at her.

Emily Johnson rolled her eyes. "Getting into fights is nothing to brag about."

"Are you hurt?" Michael asked anxiously, reaching out to check her over.

"Stop fussing." Emily swatted his hand away. "With my stick, no one could even get close."

Still, she knew this brawl would only add to her reputation in the village as the "fierce one."

"Let me see—"

"Too much free time?" Emily narrowed her eyes. "How about cleaning the house instead?"

Michael immediately withdrew his hand. "Actually, I just remembered there's work in the fields..."

Jessica River spent two days at the town clinic before being brought home. Emily carried a bag of malt extract and a packet of brown sugar, followed by her two little shadows, as she headed to Uncle Daniel's house.

"Aunt Martha..."

When Aunt Martha saw her niece-in-law arriving with gifts, she quickly waved them off. "You didn't need to bring anything just to visit Jessica."

"She needs to regain her strength." Emily held out the basket firmly.

Aunt Martha's eyes grew moist as she accepted it. "Come inside and sit."

"I'll go see Jessica first," Emily said softly. "Don't worry, Aunt Martha. I'll talk to her properly."

Aunt Martha wiped her eyes. "That child... Oh, thank you."

Inside the room, Jessica lay propped against the headboard, her face pale. Her real name was Jessica Xingxing, but the village head had thought "Xingxing" sounded too boyish when she was little, so it was changed to "Xingxing"—though everyone still called her Jessica.

"Emily..." Jessica's voice was weak. In her memory, this sister-in-law had always been delicate and spoiled by Michael. But her mother had told her that if not for Emily that day, Aunt Margaret and the others might have suffered worse.

"No need for thanks. We're family." Emily sat beside the bed. "You should have told us sooner. Infertility isn't always the woman's fault—men are often the problem."

Aunt Martha happened to walk in with a cup of water and immediately agreed. "Exactly! Christopher Garcia is the one who can't perform, yet he dared to hit you!"

Jessica's eyes reddened. All this time, she had blamed herself, enduring in silence...

"You're still young," Emily said gently. "Life is long. You have to look forward."

Aunt Martha set down the cup and quietly slipped out.

"Jessica, didn't you used to be great at needlework?" Emily suddenly asked.

Jessica blinked in surprise. Her sister-in-law had just said she was "still in the bloom of youth"...
###Chapter 292: Hidden Peril

"This dress design is lovely!" Jessica River ran her fingers over the fabric Emily had brought, her eyes sparkling.

Emily smiled slightly. "Once you're feeling better, I'll teach you how to sketch designs."

She noticed the fleeting shadow in Jessica's eyes.

"I... I don't know how to sew," Jessica murmured, her voice dropping.

"That's alright." Emily flipped open her sketchbook. "Look—just adding a bow transforms this dress completely."

When Martha River entered with a enamel mug, she caught the rare sight of her daughter smiling.

"Mom..." Jessica called softly.

Martha's eyes welled up. She quickly set down the mug and retreated. Outside, the children were sharing the White Rabbit candies Emily had brought.

"Mommy!" David Stone came running, waving a candy wrapper.

Emily ruffled his hair. "Time to go home."

On the way, Michael suddenly spoke. "The admission letter should've arrived by now."

Emily's steps faltered.

"I'll check at the post office tomorrow," Michael said, his tone darkening.

The next noon, Michael returned dusty and weary, carrying a parcel and letter.

"The post office said it hasn't come yet," he said grimly. "This is from your mother."

Emily's hands trembled as she opened the letter.

"The admission letter... could someone have stolen my identity?" Her voice shook.

Michael gripped her hand. "Don't worry. I'll keep checking daily."

His eyes hardened. Last year's rainy night flashed through his mind—Jessica covered in blood. This time, no one would lay a finger on what belonged to his wife.

"Mom wants us to return," Emily said quietly. "She mentioned arranging a job."

"What do you think?"

"Isn't business good enough?" Emily looked up. "Last year's earnings could buy two storefronts."

Michael relaxed. They were no longer pushovers.

"Michael!" Daniel River's booming voice shattered the calm.

Michael frowned toward the door. A visit at this hour never meant good news.

(Plot threads to develop:

Daniel's true motive for the sudden visit
The conspiracy behind the missing admission letter
The unspoken danger in Margaret Johnson's letter
The real reason for Jessica's sudden improvement)
###Chapter 293: The Sudden Broken Engagement
"Is it the Garcia family causing trouble?" Emily Johnson set down her chopsticks, her brow furrowing slightly. If that were the case, she needed to check immediately.

"My match wants to call off the engagement."

Daniel River's words silenced the dinner table. Four pairs of eyes turned toward him.

"What happened?" Michael Stone asked, his voice low.

Emily was equally puzzled. During their last meeting, the girl had enthusiastically discussed dowry and wedding gifts. How could she change her mind so quickly?

"She raised the dowry from sixty-eight to a hundred. Otherwise, she’ll break it off," Daniel said with a grimace.

"My mother found out the Garcias and the matchmaker are distant relatives."

Emily’s heart sank. Rural family ties were always complicated—pulling one string could unravel everything.

"Let it go. It’s not like you’re attached to her," Michael said sharply, his gaze piercing.

Daniel waved his hands. "Third Brother, I only met her once. We barely spoke."

"This needs to be settled properly," Emily said firmly. "Otherwise, the girl’s family might spread rumors, making it harder for you to find a match later."

"Would they really do that?"

"Of course they would," Michael cut in. "Listen to your sister-in-law. This must be resolved clearly."

Daniel poked at his rice, appetite gone. Why was finding a wife so difficult?

"Eat first," Emily said, placing a piece of meat in his bowl.

Daniel wolfed it down. His brother’s cooking was always richer, with more oil than at home.

"Wash the dishes," Michael ordered.

Daniel swiftly cleared the table, unfazed by the idea of a man doing chores.

Meanwhile, Martha River was complaining to Mary Stone, already planning to find another match for her son before harvest season.

Jessica River, knowing her brother’s engagement had fallen through because of her, was listless. No matter how Martha tried to console her, it didn’t help—so she asked Emily to step in.

"How’s that book coming along?" Emily asked gently.

"Not finished yet," Jessica murmured, head bowed.

It was a fashion design book, filled with sketches and patterns.

"Take your time." Emily shifted the topic. "I heard Daniel’s engagement is off?"

Jessica’s eyes reddened. "It’s all my fault..."

"Silly girl," Emily interrupted. "I was there that day. That girl acted high and mighty just because she had a factory worker relative. My whole family works in factories—did I ever boast about it?"

Jessica froze. She had always assumed her sister-in-law was just an ordinary educated youth.

"Some things are meant to be," Emily said, smoothing Jessica’s hair. "If I hadn’t stubbornly gone to the countryside, would I have met your brother?"

"No," Jessica said, finally smiling.

Some bonds were simply destined.
###Chapter 294: Destiny's Design

"Fate comes in two forms—blessed unions and ill-fated encounters. Take Christopher Garcia—that was your ill-fated match. Your true destiny still awaits."

Jessica River blinked in confusion. Blessed unions? Ill-fated encounters? These were entirely new concepts to her.

"Remember Daniel's last courtship? That was simply lacking fate's blessing. Like Charles Clark and Margaret Lee—I heard he even bought her lipstick, but her father demanded an exorbitant dowry—three hundred yuan plus the 'Three Turns and One Sound'!"

"Three hundred?" Jessica gasped. "With the dowry gifts? That's outrageous!"

"They say Margaret tried drowning herself afterward. The man who rescued her married her—the wedding's already happened."

Jessica hadn't heard any of this. Since her marriage, she rarely visited home except during holidays. The hour-long walk between Garcia Village and River Village might as well have been an ocean.

"What's meant to be will find its way," Emily Johnson sighed. "Truthfully, that girl wasn't worthy of Daniel. He's nearly six feet tall, hardworking, and handsome. That girl was barely five-foot-two, thin as a reed, with sunspots and a terrible temper."

Jessica studied Emily covertly. Her sister-in-law's porcelain skin seemed to glow, her slender fingers and raven hair making her look like a painting come to life. Her clothes were always exquisite.

The only flaw? She never worked the fields. But Michael could afford it, and her family often sent money and gifts.

"You're the most beautiful person I've ever met," Jessica said earnestly.

Emily smiled, patting her head. "You'll blossom too. When you master dressmaking, working indoors will restore your complexion. Beauty follows naturally."

Dressmaking? Jessica's eyes lit up.

As Emily emerged, Martha River hurried over. "How did it go?"

"She's steadier now. But Daniel's situation needs resolving."

Martha's face darkened. The girl's family clearly wanted to exploit the situation for more dowry.

"Let them break it!" Martha snapped. "Compared to you, that girl's like dirt beneath your feet!"

By mid-August, rice fields turned gold, but admission letters remained elusive.

"Some in town received theirs," Michael reported after his daily post office visit. "For the city university."

"Ours are for the capital. We'll wait longer."

That evening, Olivia Parker arrived breathlessly. "Emily, any news?"

Had they failed again? Last year's disappointment was understandable, but this year they'd studied relentlessly—copying test papers, even forming study groups with Emily.

"Patience," Emily soothed. "The letters may already be en route."

What else could they do but wait?
###Chapter 295: The Belated Admission Letter

"Mom, why hasn't the letter arrived yet?" Emily Johnson clutched the hem of her shirt, her fingertips turning pale.

Olivia Parker crouched on the field ridge, sweat rolling down her forehead. "The rice ripened early this year. We might have to start harvesting sooner."

"Did you apply to a university in your hometown?"

"Yeah." Olivia wiped her face with her sleeve. "Sophia did too."

Four admission letters—still no word.

"Someone from the next brigade already got theirs," Olivia whispered. "A top university, I heard."

Emily forced a smile. "Let's wait a little longer."

But the tension inside her coiled tighter.

What if she failed? How would she take the children back to the capital?

"Mommy!" Tommy Stone came bounding over, pointing at the courtyard wall. "The grapes are purple!"

Sunlight filtered through the grape leaves, casting dappled shadows on the clusters of ripe fruit.

"Go get the scissors," Emily said, her voice trembling. "Be careful."

Two bunches of grapes swirled in the basin, water droplets glistening. David Stone, ever thoughtful, fed his mother a grape first.

"Sweet?"

"Sweet." Emily's throat tightened.

Michael Stone burst into the yard. "Captain Zhang's grandson got into Provincial University! His letter came today!"

When Emily glanced at it, the gilded school name burned her eyes.

Dinner was smashed cucumber with mung bean porridge. Emily stirred the porridge absently, watching the grains sink and rise.

"For the autumn harvest, I—"

"You'll help in the canteen," Michael cut in. "Mom will handle the rest."

That wasn’t what worried her.

August 20th. If the letter didn’t come soon...

"Is Olivia Parker here?" The postman's shout electrified the brigade.

"Olivia's admission letter!"

"She really got in?"

Olivia stumbled forward, her hands shaking violently as she took the envelope. Eight years. A twenty-five-year-old woman—finally.

That afternoon, she settled her work points. Before leaving, she gripped Emily's hand. "Thank you..."

Sophia Green left the next day.

Captain John Stone Sr. gazed at the empty dormitory, knocking his pipe against the doorstep. "All gone now."

The setting sun stretched their shadows long and thin.
###Chapter 296: The Sister-in-Law's Edge

The last two educated youths left the commune's youth quarters.

The building stood empty now. Years ago, when the storm had destroyed the old house and injured the youths, the entire village had come together to build this new one. Now only memories remained.

When Olivia Parker and the other educated youth departed with their college admission letters, the villagers couldn't stop gossiping.

"Patricia, your sister-in-law failed the exams again?"

Patricia Stone kept her head down, sickle flashing through the rice stalks. Harvest season left no time for idle chatter.

She knew better than to speak carelessly. That day at the Chen household, she'd witnessed Emily Johnson's formidable temper firsthand—the memory still sent chills down her spine. All these years, her sister-in-law had shown remarkable restraint by not holding grudges.

Rumors said Emily's family had even secured Michael Stone a city job. Even without passing exams, they could return to urban life. Who'd dare cross them?

"The admission letters haven't all arrived yet," Patricia wiped her brow. "Those two youths studied under my sister-in-law's guidance. If they passed, how could she fail?"

The crowd exchanged glances. Her logic was sound.

"This year's harvest is exceptional!" The elders marveled at the heavy rice panicles. Without Emily's help, such bounty would've been impossible.

"Extra grain rations for everyone!" The commune members rejoiced. While other brigades suffered corn shortages, theirs flourished.

"Emily, take a break." Mary Stone watched her daughter-in-law work with concern. She longed to ask about the admission letter but feared adding pressure.

At dinner, Michael whispered, "I've got people watching the post office. We'll know immediately when news comes." He hesitated. "I've even arranged watchers in the county town."

"What if I failed?"

"You won't." Michael's voice held steel.

Two days later, the postman's shout echoed across the fields.

"Michael Stone! Are you here?"

Robert Stone's hand trembled mid-swing, nearly dropping his sickle. "Michael! Michael passed!" His voice shook with excitement.

The commune members gaped. Wasn't he just accompanying his wife for exams? How did he get admitted?

John Stone Sr. sprinted over, dragging his son to claim the letter. Under the sunlight, that admission notice gleamed brighter than gold.
###Chapter 297: The Admission Letter Storm

"Michael Stone, there's an admission letter for you!"

The postman's voice echoed at the village entrance, instantly drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. Michael sprinted over, his heart pounding like a drum.

"Is it just mine?" he asked urgently. "Is there one for Emily Johnson?"

The postman shook his head. "Only this one for your brigade. Sign here."

Michael's hand trembled slightly as he signed. The admission letter felt light in his grasp, yet carried the weight of a thousand pounds.

"Son, let me see!" John Stone Sr. choked up, his eyes reddening. He'd dreamed of his son making something of himself, but never dared hope for college.

Villagers crowded around, murmuring excitedly.

"So this is a university admission letter..."
"School starts September 15th—only twenty days left!"
"The Stone ancestors must be smiling down!"

Michael grinned from ear to ear. "All thanks to my wife's tutoring. I never thought I'd actually get in."

"Which university?" someone asked.

"The one in the capital," Michael answered proudly.

"The capital!" The villagers gasped in awe.

John Sr. waved them off as the crowd grew. "Alright, everyone, back to work!"

Once alone, he lowered his voice. "Your wife hasn't received hers yet. Could it be..."

"Impossible!" Michael cut in sharply. "Emily scored higher than me. She tutored Olivia Parker and Sophia Green—they both got in. I suspect..."

John Sr.'s face darkened, recalling last year's identity theft scandal.

"Go to the county office tomorrow and check," he said, gripping his son's shoulder. "If anyone stole your wife's spot, they'll answer to me first."

A dangerous glint flashed in Michael's eyes. "I'll make them regret being born."

After leaving his father, Michael rushed to the brigade canteen. "Mom! Emily!" he called from the doorway, waving the envelope triumphantly.

Mary Stone and Emily looked up as he burst in, unable to contain his joy.

"An admission letter?" a sharp-eyed auntie exclaimed.

"Yes!" Michael's voice shook with emotion.

Mary's hands trembled. "Really? My son got into college?"

Emily arched a brow, feigning sternness. "Congratulations, Michael Stone. You're officially a college student now."

"Emily!" He swept her into a spinning hug. No more being just the accompanying husband—they'd go to the capital together!

"Michael! Michael!" Charles Clark barged in breathlessly. "You really got in?"

He circled Michael excitedly. "Let me see what the letter looks like!"

Just as Michael extended it, Mary snatched it away. "This is precious! What if you damage it?" She carefully tucked it away. "Go home and put this somewhere safe, then get back to work."

By lunchtime, the entire brigade buzzed with the news.

"Michael actually made it..."
"His wife tutored him..."
"Emily hasn't received hers yet..."

The whispers made Michael's fists clench. Whoever dared interfere with Emily's future would pay dearly.
###Chapter 298: Undercurrents in the Admission Letters

"Michael Stone got into university in the capital!"

"That troublemaker who's always getting into fights?"

"Now I've seen everything."

"Bro, you're amazing!" Daniel River rubbed his hands excitedly, his dark face flushed with pride. He threw his arms around Michael, nearly squeezing the breath out of him.

Who would've thought Michael would pass the university entrance exam on his first try? Just last year, they'd been worried about what would happen to him after Emily got accepted. Yet here he was, quietly succeeding where no one expected.

Samuel Bright cracked a rare smile. "Congratulations, Michael." Though more reserved than Daniel, his eyes shone with admiration.

"Thanks..."

"Emily, Michael is incredible!" Amy Bright chirped, bouncing over to Emily Johnson like an excited sparrow.

The twins, David and Tommy, puffed up with pride. Villagers kept stopping them to say, "Your father got into university!"

"I'm going to town tomorrow," Michael murmured to Emily. "My admission letter arrived, but yours still hasn't. I think someone's interfering."

Emily's stomach tightened. Last year's identity theft scandal should've been a warning—yet someone dared try again.

"Be careful," she said, gripping her husband's hand. "If anything seems wrong, go straight to the police. Don't do anything rash."

"Don't worry. I'll handle it."

The next day, Michael headed to town with his reference letter and Emily's documents. His first stop was the post office, where an old friend worked.

"Any news about my wife's admission letter?"

"Michael, there's trouble." His friend's expression darkened. "I know someone who barely passed the exams but got an acceptance letter. Meanwhile, several top students still haven't received theirs."

Michael's eyes turned icy. "They've got nerve."

Leaning closer, he whispered instructions. "I'm counting on you."

"Consider it done."

Soon, rumors spread through town: someone was stealing admission letters to steal university spots.

In this era, university admission meant hope for entire families. Several families who hadn't received letters stormed the police station—not just one or two, but multiple at once.

The police chief groaned. They'd just dealt with a similar case last year. Was it happening again?

The education bureau was alerted.

Meanwhile, Michael quietly stoked the flames.

"Where's Michael?" Mary Stone fretted at home. She and her husband debated—despite the busy harvest season, they needed to prepare a proper celebration.
###Chapter 299: The Truth Revealed

"I'm not sure," Emily Johnson lowered her eyes, her fingers unconsciously rubbing the hem of her dress. She couldn't say her husband had gone to the county town to investigate the missing admission letters.

Did he go hunting in the mountains?
Or was he running errands in town?

Mary Stone hesitated. Her youngest son had been accepted into university, but her daughter-in-law's admission letter still hadn't arrived. She didn’t want to bring it up and make Emily feel worse.

"Never mind him," Mary changed the subject. "This mint water has too much saccharin."

With so many people in the brigade, how could they afford real sugar?
Saccharin would have to do.

A few teenage boys were in charge of delivering the water.
Emily had added mint and lemon juice to make it refreshingly sweet and sour.

When steaming the buns, whether using cornmeal or mixed flour, she always added yeast. That way, the buns came out soft and fluffy, not hard and dense.

"Without enough saccharin, it won’t taste sweet," Emily explained softly.

"Too sweet makes people thirstier..."

"Mom, Dad gave us enough saccharin."

Mary sighed and let it go.
The saccharin-sweetened water was still far better than plain water.

Meanwhile, in the county town, Michael Stone was closely monitoring the situation.

After the families of several students whose admission letters had gone missing stormed the authorities, an investigation was immediately launched.
The education bureau had no choice but to cooperate.

Who would risk ruining years of political career over this?
They had to act fast.

Starting from the county post office, they traced where the admission letters had been intercepted—and who had ended up with them.

The police moved swiftly, detaining all post office staff for questioning.
Separate interrogations were conducted to prevent collusion.

"Where’s my letter? Give it back!" An eighteen-year-old boy, eyes bloodshot, struggled against the officers restraining him as he tried to lunge at a detained postal worker.

He had scored exceptionally well in the preliminary exams, yet while his classmates received their admission letters, his never arrived. Now, learning that those with worse grades had taken his place in university, how could he not lose his mind?

"Son, stop this!" A gray-haired woman clung desperately to him. "The officers will get to the bottom of this. Justice will be served!"

"Please remain calm, sir. We will investigate thoroughly and ensure accountability!"

The old woman trembled as she held her son’s hand. "We trust the government... we trust the government..."

"Mom! My future..."

Other parents waited with red-rimmed eyes for answers.

The interrogations soon yielded results.
A minor post office supervisor had conspired with a worker to intercept several admission letters, selling them at high prices to those desperate for a university spot.

"You’ve got some nerve!" The police chief slammed his hand on the table. "Even the provincial top scorer’s letter was stolen!"

This was supposed to be a proud moment for the entire county!
And these people had ruined it.

The two culprits hung their heads, not daring to speak.
They had made two thousand yuan from the scheme—now it was all over.

Higher authorities personally oversaw the case.
Soon, every stolen admission letter was returned to its rightful owner.


###Chapter 300: The Admission Letter Incident

"Secretary, there's a special admission letter here..." The post office clerk carefully handed over the envelope.

The county party secretary didn't even look up. "Let the recipient come pick it up themselves."

"It's for the provincial top scorer," the clerk added in a hushed voice.

"What?" The secretary shot to his feet, papers scattering across the floor. His face turned ashen, fingers trembling slightly. If the city officials found out their county had withheld the top scorer's admission letter, how could he possibly keep his position?

"Who did this?" he demanded through gritted teeth.

The police chief wiped sweat from his brow. "We've already detained the suspects. They're being interrogated."

The secretary took a deep breath. "Tomorrow, I'll personally deliver the letter. And bring the county's reward along."

"Understood."

Michael Stone finished his errands in town and bought a pack of cigarettes to thank the friend who'd helped him. By the time he caught the last bus back to the village, dusk had fallen. He quickened his pace toward home, warmth blooming in his chest at the sight of their lit window.

"Emily, I'm back!" he called as he pushed open the door.

Emily Johnson was busy at the stove. Her eyes brightened when she saw him. "Hungry? I'll make you some noodles."

"I'll tend the fire." Michael crouched by the hearth, adding firewood as he spoke. "We got to the bottom of it. A post office supervisor and clerk were working together. Several students in the county never received their admission letters. Someone reported it, and that's how they got caught."

Emily stirred the pot, a small smile playing on her lips. "I knew I passed."

"Of course you did!" Michael shoved another log into the fire. "When your letter arrives, I'll go hunting for wild boar to celebrate."

"That's too dangerous..."

"I'll take Charles and the others with me."

Emily recalled how delicious the last wild boar they'd caught had been. "Then I'll prepare some candy to share with the neighbors."

"Deal."

Children's laughter drifted in from outside. David and Tommy burst in, covered in dirt, their faces sunburned, clutching handfuls of rice stalks.

"Go wash up," Emily frowned at the two mud-covered boys.

Michael hoisted them up. "No straw hats again? How are you going to look presentable when we go to the city like this?"

"The city?" Their eyes widened instantly. "Dad, are you taking us to the city?"

"Not if you keep getting darker." Michael pretended to scowl.

"We'll wear them tomorrow!" they chorused.

After their bath, the brothers drank their milk obediently and went to bed. Emily and Michael tidied up quietly.

At dawn, Emily headed to the communal kitchen to prepare breakfast while Michael shouldered his sickle and went to the fields.

"Michael, what were you doing in town yesterday?" Daniel River sidled up to ask.

"Tried to get some meat. Didn't work out." Michael shoveled porridge into his mouth.

Daniel waggled his eyebrows. "I thought you went to check on Emily's admission letter!"

Michael shot him a look. The kid had certainly become livelier since calling off his engagement. "Eat more. Talk less."

"The food's especially good this year. Heard Emily's been doing the cooking?" Daniel grinned.
