After a freak accident, Emily Johnson transmigrates into a spoiled novel antagonist fated to abandon her military husband and twin sons, only to die destitute. Defying the plot, she uses a mysterious shopping app to nourish her malnourished stepchildren, transforming them into thriving toddlers. When stoic officer Michael Stone returns, expecting divorce papers, he’s met with domestic warmth—chubby boys clinging to his legs and a wife rewriting her villainous role. Refusing her exit, Michael’s icy demeanor thaws, derailing the original storyline. Now trapped in a rewritten narrative, Emily scrambles to escape the male lead’s sudden obsession, while the twins wage tearful warfare to keep their “mommy” from vanishing.
